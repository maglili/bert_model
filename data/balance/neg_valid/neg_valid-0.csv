Expression of particulate-form of Japanese encephalitis virus envelope protein in a stably transfected Drosophila cell line,17324254,10.1186/1743-422X-4-17,"Background: Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), a member of the family Flaviviridae, is an important mosquito-borne human pathogen. Its envelope glycoprotein (E) is the major determinant of the pathogenicity and host immune responses. In the present study, we explored the feasibility of producing recombinant JEV E protein in the virus-free Drosophila expression system. Results: The coding sequence for the signal sequence of premembrane and E protein was cloned into the Drosophila expression vector pAc5.1/V5-His. A Drosophila cell line S2 was cotransfected with this construct as well as a plasmid providing hygromycin B resistance. A cell line expressing the JEV E protein was selected by immunofluoresence, confocal microscopy, and western blot analysis using three different monoclonal antibodies directed against JEV E protein. This cell line was stable in the yield of JEV E protein during two months in vitro maintenance in the presence of hygromycin B. The results showed that the recombinant E protein had an expected molecular weight of about 50 kilodalton, was immunoreactive with all three monoclonal antibodies, and found in both the cytoplasm and culture supernatant. Sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation analysis revealed that the secreted E protein product was in a particulate form. It migrated to the sucrose fraction with a density of 1.13 g/ml. Balb/c mice immunised with the sucrose fraction containing the E protein particles developed specific antibodies. These data show that functioning JEV E protein was expressed in the stable S2 cell line. Conclusion: The Drosophila expression system is a more convenient, cheaper and safer approach to the production of vaccine candidates and diagnostic reagents for JEV.",2007,"Hongyi Zhang, Li Zhang, Marlen Aasa-Chapman, Wenyu Ma, Fuquan Zhang"
Regional control of chromatin organization by noncoding roX RNAs and the NURF remodeling complex in Drosophila melanogaster,17507677,10.1534/genetics.107.071571,"Dosage compensation in Drosophila is mediated by a histone-modifying complex that upregulates transcription of genes on the single male X chromosome. The male-specific lethal (MSL) complex contains at least five proteins and two noncoding roX (RNA on X) RNAs. The mechanism by which the MSL complex targets the X chromosome is not understood. Here we use a sensitized system to examine the function of roX genes on the X chromosome. In mutants that lack the NURF nucleosome remodeling complex, the male polytene X chromosome is severely distorted, appearing decondensed. This aberrant morphology is dependent on the MSL complex. Strikingly, roX mutations suppress the Nurf mutant phenotype regionally on the male X chromosome. Furthermore, a roX transgene induces disruption of local flanking autosomal chromatin in Nurf mutants. Taken together, these results demonstrate the potent capability of roX genes to organize large chromatin domains in cis, on the X chromosome. In addition to interacting functions at the level of chromosome morphology, we also find that NURF complex and MSL proteins have opposing effects on roX RNA transcription. Together, these results demonstrate the importance of a local balance between modifying activities that promote and antagonize chromatin compaction within defined chromatin domains in higher organisms.",2007,"X Bai, M I Kuroda, E Larschan, P Badenhorst, S Y Kwon"
"TRB2, a mouse Tribbles ortholog, suppresses adipocyte differentiation by inhibiting AKT and C/EBPbeta",17576771,10.1074/jbc.M701409200,"Adipocyte differentiation is regulated by a complex array of extracellular signals, intracellular mediators and transcription factors. Here we describe suppression of adipocyte differentiation by TRBs, mammalian orthologs of Drosophila Tribbles. Whereas all the three TRBs were expressed in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, TRB2 and TRB3, but not TRB1, were immediately down-regulated by differentiation stimuli. Forced expression of TRB2 and TRB3 inhibited adipocyte differentiation at an early stage. Akt activation is a key event in adipogenesis and was severely inhibited by TRB3 in 3T3-L1 cells. However, the inhibition by TRB2 was mild compared with severe inhibition by TRB3, though TRB2 suppressed adipogenesis as strongly as TRB3. Interestingly, TRB2 but not TRB3 reduced the level of C/EBPbeta, a transcription factor required for an early stage of adipogenesis, through a proteasome-dependent mechanism. Furthermore, knockdown of endogenous TRB2 by siRNA allowed 3T3-L1 cells to differentiate without full differentiation stimuli. These results suggest that inhibition of Akt activation in combination with degradation of C/EBPbeta is the basis for the strong inhibitory effect of TRB2 on adipogenesis.",2007,"Takahiro Naiki, Atsushi Miyajima, Yuichiro Miyaoka, Keisuke Sekine, Eiko Saijou"
Muscle stem cells and model systems for their investigation,17948301,10.1002/dvdy.21345,"Stem cells are characterized by their clonal ability both to generate differentiated progeny and to undergo self-renewal. Studies of adult mammalian organs have revealed stem cells in practically every tissue. In the adult skeletal muscle, satellite cells are the primary muscle stem cells, responsible for postnatal muscle growth, hypertrophy, and regeneration. In the past decade, several molecular markers have been found that identify satellite cells in quiescent and activated states. However, despite their prime importance, surprisingly little is known about the biology of satellite cells, as their analysis was for a long time hampered by a lack of genetically amenable experimental models where their properties can be dissected. Here, we review how the embryonic origin of satellite cells was discovered using chick and mouse model systems and discuss how cells from other sources can contribute to muscle regeneration. We present evidence for evolutionarily conserved properties of muscle stem cells and their identification in lower vertebrates and in the fruit fly. In Drosophila, muscle stem cells called adult muscle precursors (AMP) can be identified in embryos and in larvae by persistent expression of a myogenic basic helix-loop-helix factor Twist. AMP cells play a crucial role in the Drosophila life cycle, allowing de novo formation and regeneration of adult musculature during metamorphosis. Based on the premise that AMPs represent satellite-like cells of the fruit fly, important insight into the biology of vertebrate muscle stem cells can be gained from genetic analysis in Drosophila.",2007,"Christophe Marcelle, Malgorzata Daczewska, Nicolas Figeac, Krzysztof Jagla"
Clinal distribution of a chromosomal rearrangement: a precursor to chromosomal speciation?,18522710,10.1111/j.1558-5646.2008.00435.x,"Geographically structured genetic variants provide an effective means to assess sources of natural selection and mechanisms of adaptation to local environments. Correlated selection pressures along environmental gradients favor subdivision of genomes through chromosomal rearrangement. This study examines populations of Drosophila americana to evaluate selection pressures affecting chromosomal forms distinguished by a centromeric fusion. Analyses of chromosomal polymorphism throughout the Mississippi River Valley in the central United States reveal the presence of a distinct latitudinal cline for the chromosomal rearrangement. The cline has a width of 623 km centered at 35.97 degrees N and displays a characteristic sigmoid shape consistent with a balance between selection and dispersal. Extreme low temperature during January, an indicator of winter severity, was identified as the environmental variable that most accurately predicts arrangement frequency. An intriguing relationship identified between the chromosomal cline and operational sex ratio indicates that these alternative arrangements of the X chromosome may influence sex-specific survival. A hypothesis for the cline is presented wherein variation associated with the alternative chromosome forms influences distinct overwintering strategies. The resulting subdivision within the genome embodies a transitory stage of a speciation process in which locally adapted gene complexes provide a foundation for species formation.",2008,"Amy L Evans, Sara L Sheeley, Christian Schl√∂tterer, Bryant F McAllister, Paulina A Mena"
Autophagy in neurodegeneration and development,18644437,10.1016/j.bbadis.2008.06.010,"Efficient protein turnover is essential for the maintenance of cellular health. Here we review how autophagy has fundamental functions in cellular homeostasis and possible uses as a therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative diseases associated with intracytosolic aggregate formation, like Huntington's disease (HD). Drugs like rapamycin, that induce autophagy, increase the clearance of mutant huntingtin fragments and ameliorate the pathology in cell and animal models of HD and related conditions. In Drosophila, the beneficial effects of rapamycin in diseases related to HD are autophagy-dependent. We will also discuss the importance of autophagy in early stages of development and its possible contribution as a secondary disease mechanism in forms of fronto-temporal dementias, motor neuron disease, and lysosomal storage disorders.",2008,"Ashley R Winslow, David C Rubinsztein"
The origin recognition complex is dispensable for endoreplication in Drosophila,18711130,10.1073/pnas.0805189105,"The origin recognition complex (ORC) is an essential component of the prereplication complex (pre-RC) in mitotic cell cycles. The role of ORC as a foundation to assemble the pre-RC is conserved from yeast to human. Furthermore, in metazoans ORC plays a key role in determining the timing of replication initiation and origin usage. In this report we have produced and analyzed a Drosophila orc1 allele to investigate the roles of ORC1 in three different modes of DNA replication during development. As expected, ORC1 is essential for mitotic replication and proliferation in brains and imaginal discs, as well as for gene amplification in ovarian follicle cells. Surprisingly, however, ORC1 is not required for endoreplication. Decreased cell number in orc1 mutant salivary glands is consistent with the idea that undetectable levels of maternal ORC1 during embryogenesis fail to support further proliferation. Nevertheless, these cells begin endoreplicating normally and reach a final ploidy of >1000C in the absence of zygotic synthesis of ORC1. The dispensability of ORC is further supported by an examination of other ORC members, whereas Double-parked protein/Cdt1 and minichromosome maintenance proteins are apparently essential for endoreplication, implying that some aspects of initiation are shared among the three modes of DNA replication. This study provides insight into the physiologic roles of ORC during metazoan development and proposes that DNA replication initiation is governed differently in mitotic and endocycles.",2008,"So Young Park, Maki Asano"
Alternative respiratory chain enzymes: Therapeutic potential and possible pitfalls,30342157,10.1016/j.bbadis.2018.10.012,"The alternative respiratory chain (aRC), comprising the alternative NADH dehydrogenases (NDX) and quinone oxidases (AOX), is found in microbes, fungi and plants, where it buffers stresses arising from restrictions on electron flow in the oxidative phosphorylation system. The aRC enzymes are also found in species belonging to most metazoan phyla, including some chordates and arthropods species, although not in vertebrates or in Drosophila. We postulated that the aRC enzymes might be deployed to alleviate pathological stresses arising from mitochondrial dysfunction in a wide variety of disease states. However, before such therapies can be contemplated, it is essential to understand the effects of aRC enzymes on cell metabolism and organismal physiology. Here we report and discuss new findings that shed light on the functions of the aRC enzymes in animals, and the unexpected benefits and detriments that they confer on model organisms. In Ciona intestinalis, the aRC is induced by hypoxia and by sulfide, but is unresponsive to other environmental stressors. When expressed in Drosophila, AOX results in impaired survival under restricted nutrition, in addition to the previously reported male reproductive anomalies. In contrast, it confers cold resistance to developing and adult flies, and counteracts cell signaling defects that underlie developmental dysmorphologies. The aRC enzymes may also influence lifespan and stress resistance more generally, by eliciting or interfering with hormetic mechanisms. In sum, their judicious use may lead to major benefits in medicine, but this will require a thorough characterization of their properties and physiological effects.",2019,"Katharina Bremer, Geovana S Garcia, Paul V Debes, Marten Szibor, Mikko Nikinmaa, Pierre Rustin, Marcos T Oliveira, Howard T Jacobs, Ana Andjelkoviƒá, Eric Dufour, Marina M Chioda, Sina Saari"
The dPix-Git complex is essential to coordinate epithelial morphogenesis and regulate myosin during Drosophila egg chamber development,31116733,10.1371/journal.pgen.1008083,"How biochemical and mechanical information are integrated during tissue development is a central question in morphogenesis. In many biological systems, the PIX-GIT complex localises to focal adhesions and integrates both physical and chemical information. We used Drosophila melanogaster egg chamber formation to study the function of PIX and GIT orthologues (dPix and Git, respectively), and discovered a central role for this complex in controlling myosin activity and epithelial monolayering. We found that Git's focal adhesion targeting domain mediates basal localisation of this complex to filament structures and the leading edge of migrating cells. In the absence of dpix and git, tissue disruption is driven by contractile forces, as reduction of myosin activators restores egg production and morphology. Further, dpix and git mutant eggs closely phenocopy defects previously reported in pak mutant epithelia. Together, these results indicate that the dPix-Git complex controls egg chamber morphogenesis by controlling myosin contractility and Pak kinase downstream of focal adhesions.",2019,"Kieran F Harvey, Luke Crea, Lucas G Dent, Benjamin Kroeger, Abdul Jabbar Saiful Hilmi, Shu Kondo, Audrey M Williams, Samuel A Manning, Sally Horne-Badovinac"
Microbes Promote Amino Acid Harvest to Rescue Undernutrition in Drosophila,25683709,10.1016/j.celrep.2015.01.018,"Microbes play an important role in the pathogenesis of nutritional disorders such as protein-specific malnutrition. However, the precise contribution of microbes to host energy balance during undernutrition is unclear. Here, we show that Issatchenkia orientalis, a fungal microbe isolated from field-caught Drosophila melanogaster, promotes amino acid harvest to rescue the lifespan of undernourished flies. Using radioisotope-labeled dietary components (amino acids, nucleotides, and sucrose) to quantify nutrient transfer from food to microbe to fly, we demonstrate that I. orientalis extracts amino acids directly from nutrient-poor diets and increases protein flux to the fly. This microbial association restores body mass, protein, glycerol, and ATP levels and phenocopies the metabolic profile of adequately fed flies. Our study uncovers amino acid harvest as a fundamental mechanism linking microbial and host metabolism, and highlights Drosophila as a platform for quantitative studies of host-microbe relationships.",2015,"Elizabeth M Mak, Sonali A Deshpande, Kimberley D Bruce, William W Ja, Ryuichi Yamada"
In vivo RNAi screen identifies candidate signaling genes required for collective cell migration in Drosophila ovary,25528253,10.1007/s11427-014-4786-z,"Collective migration of loosely or closely associated cell groups is prevalent in animal development, physiological events, and cancer metastasis. However, our understanding of the mechanisms of collective cell migration is incomplete. Drosophila border cells provide a powerful in vivo genetic model to study collective migration and identify essential genes for this process. Using border cell-specific RNAi-silencing in Drosophila, we knocked down 360 conserved signaling transduction genes in adult flies to identify essential pathways and genes for border cell migration. We uncovered a plethora of signaling genes, a large proportion of which had not been reported for border cells, including Rack1 (Receptor of activated C kinase) and brk (brinker), mad (mother against dpp), and sax (saxophone), which encode three components of TGF-Œ≤ signaling. The RNAi knock down phenotype was validated by clonal analysis of Rack1 mutants. Our data suggest that inhibition of Src activity by Rack1 may be important for border cell migration and cluster cohesion maintenance. Lastly, results from our screen not only would shed light on signaling pathways involved in collective migration during embryogenesis and organogenesis in general, but also could help our understanding for the functions of conserved human genes involved in cancer metastasis.",2015,"Jiong Chen, Hong Zhu, Jun Luo, Ping Wan, Jing Wu, Cong Xiang, Di Kang, JunTao Zuo"
Wallenda regulates JNK-mediated cell death in Drosophila,25950467,10.1038/cddis.2015.111,"The c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway plays essential roles in regulating a variety of cellular processes including proliferation, migration and survival. Previous genetic studies in Drosophila have identified numerous cell death regulating genes, providing new insights into the mechanisms for related diseases. Despite the known role of the small GTPase Rac1 in regulating cell death, the downstream components and underlying mechanism remain largely elusive. Here, we show that Rac1 promotes JNK-dependent cell death through Wallenda (Wnd). In addition, we find that Wnd triggers JNK activation and cell death via its kinase domain. Moreover, we show that both MKK4 and Hep are critical for Wnd-induced cell death. Furthermore, Wnd is essential for ectopic Egr- or Rho1-induced JNK activation and cell death. Finally, Wnd is physiologically required for loss of scribble-induced JNK-dependent cell death. Thus, our data suggest that wnd encodes a novel essential cell death regulator in Drosophila.",2015,"D Zhang, W Li, W Xu, X Ma, Y Yang, L Xue"
"Genome-wide identification and expression profiling of serine proteases and homologs in the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (L.)",26653876,10.1186/s12864-015-2243-4,"Background: Serine proteases (SPs) are crucial proteolytic enzymes responsible for digestion and other processes including signal transduction and immune responses in insects. Serine protease homologs (SPHs) lack catalytic activity but are involved in innate immunity. This study presents a genome-wide investigation of SPs and SPHs in the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (L.), a globally-distributed destructive pest of cruciferous crops. Results: A total of 120 putative SPs and 101 putative SPHs were identified in the P. xylostella genome by bioinformatics analysis. Based on the features of trypsin, 38 SPs were putatively designated as trypsin genes. The distribution, transcription orientation, exon-intron structure and sequence alignments suggested that the majority of trypsin genes evolved from tandem duplications. Among the 221 SP/SPH genes, ten SP and three SPH genes with one or more clip domains were predicted and designated as PxCLIPs. Phylogenetic analysis of CLIPs in P. xylostella, two other Lepidoptera species (Bombyx mori and Manduca sexta), and two more distantly related insects (Drosophila melanogaster and Apis mellifera) showed that seven of the 13 PxCLIPs were clustered with homologs of the Lepidoptera rather than other species. Expression profiling of the P. xylostella SP and SPH genes in different developmental stages and tissues showed diverse expression patterns, suggesting high functional diversity with roles in digestion and development. Conclusions: This is the first genome-wide investigation on the SP and SPH genes in P. xylostella. The characterized features and profiled expression patterns of the P. xylostella SPs and SPHs suggest their involvement in digestion, development and immunity of this species. Our findings provide a foundation for further research on the functions of this gene family in P. xylostella, and a better understanding of its capacity to rapidly adapt to a wide range of environmental variables including host plants and insecticides.",2015,"Minsheng You, Fengluan Yao, Guang Yang, Geoff M Gurr, Hailan Lin, Liette Vasseur, Xiaofeng Xia, Liying Yu"
"A Temporal Transcriptional Switch Governs Stem Cell Division, Neuronal Numbers, and Maintenance of Differentiation",29576424,10.1016/j.devcel.2018.02.023,"The importance of producing the correct numbers of neurons during development is illustrated by both evolutionary enhancement of cognitive capacities in larger brains, and developmental disorders of brain size. In humans, increased neuronal numbers during development is speculated to partly derive from a unique subtype of neural stem cells (NSCs) that undergo a phase of expansion through symmetric self-amplifying divisions before generating neurons. Symmetric amplification also appears to underlie adult neural stem maintenance in the mouse. However, the mechanisms regulating this behavior are unclear. We report the discovery of self-amplifying NSCs in Drosophila and show that they arise by a spatiotemporal conversion of classical self-renewing NSCs. This conversion is regulated by a temporal transition in the expression of proneural transcription factors prior to cell division. We find a causal link between stem cell self-amplification and increased neuronal numbers. We further show that the temporal transcriptional switch controls both stem cell division and subsequent neuronal differentiation.",2018,"Alessia Soldano, Natalia Mora, Radoslaw Ejsmont, Jiekun Yan, Mark Fiers, Natalie De Geest, Bassem A Hassan, Carlos Oliva, Annelies Claeys, Ting-Ting Zhang"
A Druggable Genome Screen Identifies Modifiers of Œ±-Synuclein Levels via a Tiered Cross-Species Validation Approach,30249792,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0254-18.2018,"Accumulation of Œ±-Synuclein (Œ±-Syn) causes Parkinson's disease (PD) as well as other synucleopathies. Œ±-Syn is the major component of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, the proteinaceous aggregates that are a hallmark of sporadic PD. In familial forms of PD, mutations or copy number variations in SNCA (the Œ±-Syn gene) result in a net increase of its protein levels. Furthermore, common risk variants tied to PD are associated with small increases of wild-type Œ±-Syn levels. These findings are further bolstered by animal studies which show that overexpression of Œ±-Syn is sufficient to cause PD-like features. Thus, increased Œ±-Syn levels are intrinsically tied to PD pathogenesis and underscore the importance of identifying the factors that regulate its levels. In this study, we establish a pooled RNAi screening approach and validation pipeline to probe the druggable genome for modifiers of Œ±-Syn levels and identify 60 promising targets. Using a cross-species, tiered validation approach, we validate six strong candidates that modulate Œ±-Syn levels and toxicity in cell lines, Drosophila, human neurons, and mouse brain of both sexes. More broadly, this genetic strategy and validation pipeline can be applied for the identification of therapeutic targets for disorders driven by dosage-sensitive proteins.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT We present a research strategy for the systematic identification and validation of genes modulating the levels of Œ±-Synuclein, a protein involved in Parkinson's disease. A cell-based screen of the druggable genome (>7,500 genes that are potential therapeutic targets) yielded many modulators of Œ±-Synuclein that were subsequently confirmed and validated in Drosophila, human neurons, and mouse brain.

Activation of PLC by an endogenous cytokine (GBP) in Drosophila S3 cells and its application as a model for studying inositol phosphate signalling through ITPK1,22928859,10.1042/BJ20120730,"Using immortalized [3H]inositol-labelled S3 cells, we demonstrated in the present study that various elements of the inositol phosphate signalling cascade are recruited by a Drosophila homologue from a cytokine family of so-called GBPs (growth-blocking peptides). HPLC analysis revealed that dGBP (Drosophila GBP) elevated Ins(1,4,5)P3 levels 9-fold. By using fluorescent Ca2+ probes, we determined that dGBP initially mobilized Ca2+ from intracellular pools; the ensuing depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores by dGBP subsequently activated a Ca2+ entry pathway. The addition of dsRNA (double-stranded RNA) to knock down expression of the Drosophila Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor almost completely eliminated mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ stores by dGBP. Taken together, the results of the present study describe a classical activation of PLC (phospholipase C) by dGBP. The peptide also promoted increases in the levels of other inositol phosphates with signalling credentials: Ins(1,3,4,5)P4, Ins(1,4,5,6)P4 and Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5. These results greatly expand the regulatory repertoire of the dGBP family, and also characterize S3 cells as a model for studying the regulation of inositol phosphate metabolism and signalling by endogenous cell-surface receptors. We therefore created a cell-line (S3ITPK1) in which heterologous expression of human ITPK (inositol tetrakisphosphate kinase) was controlled by an inducible metallothionein promoter. We found that dGBP-stimulated S3ITPK1 cells did not synthesize Ins(3,4,5,6)P4, contradicting a hypothesis that the PLC-coupled phosphotransferase activity of ITPK1 [Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5+Ins(1,3,4)P3‚ÜíIns(3,4,5,6)P4+Ins(1,3,4,6)P4] is driven solely by the laws of mass action [Chamberlain, Qian, Stiles, Cho, Jones, Lesley, Grabau, Shears and Spraggon (2007) J.

Spatiotemporal dynamics of Spc105 regulates the assembly of the Drosophila kinetochore,22645658,10.1098/rsob.110032,"The formation of kinetochores shortly before each cell division is a prerequisite for proper chromosome segregation. The synchronous mitoses of Drosophila syncytial embryos have provided an ideal in vivo system to follow kinetochore assembly kinetics and so address the question of how kinetochore formation is regulated. We found that the nuclear exclusion of the Spc105/KNL1 protein during interphase prevents precocious assembly of the Mis12 complex. The nuclear import of Spc105 in early prophase and its immediate association with the Mis12 complex on centromeres are thus the first steps in kinetochore assembly. The cumulative kinetochore levels of Spc105 and Mis12 complex then determine the rate of Ndc80 complex recruitment commencing only after nuclear envelope breakdown. The carboxy-terminal part of Spc105 directs its nuclear import and is sufficient for the assembly of all core kinetochore components and CENP-C, when localized ectopically to centrosomes. Super-resolution microscopy shows that carboxy-terminus of Spc105 lies at the junction of the Mis12 and Ndc80 complexes on stretched kinetochores. Our study thus indicates that physical accessibility of kinetochore components plays a crucial role in the regulation of Drosophila kinetochore assembly and leads us to a model in which Spc105 is a licensing factor for its onset.",2012,"Alex Sossick, Shahad Albadri, Zsolt Venkei, Marcin R Przewloka, David M Glover, B√©la Nov√°k, Gabor Juhasz, Yaseen Ladak"
Novel oxidatively activated agents modify DNA and are enhanced by ercc1 silencing,23051149,10.1021/tx300337j,"Agents that chemically modify DNA form a backbone of many cancer treatments. A key problem for DNA-modifying agents is lack of specificity. To address this issue, we designed novel molecular scaffolds, termed An-Hq and An-Hq(2), which are activated by a hallmark of some cancers: elevated concentrations of reactive oxygen species. Elevated reactive oxygen species are linked to oncogenesis and are found to increase in several aggressive cancers. The agents are quinones that, upon oxidation, form highly electrophilic species. In vitro studies identified the mode of addition to DNA. The aniline portion of An-Hq serves to enhance nucleophilic addition to the ethyl phenyl ether instead of forming common Michael additions. Structural characterization showed that the agents add to 2'-deoxyguanosine at the N2,N3-positions. The product formed is a bulky hydroxy-N2,3-benzetheno-2'-deoxyguanosine adduct. In addition, the oxidatively activated agents added to 2'-deoxyadenosine and 2'-deoxycytidine but not thymidine or 2'-deoxyinosine. These findings are confirmed by primer extension analysis of a 392 base pair DNA. The full-length primer extension product was reduced by 69.0 ¬± 0.6% upon oxidative activation of An-Hq(2) as compared to controls. Little sequence dependence was observed with 76% of guanine, adenine, and cytosine residues showing an increase in extension stops between 2- and 4-fold above controls. Benzetheno-nucleobase addition to double-stranded DNA was confirmed by LC/MS of a self-complementary oligonucletide. Experiments were carried out to confirm in vivo DNA damage. Because of the lesion identified in vitro, we reasoned that nucleotide excision repair should be involved in reversing the effects of these oxidatively activated agents and enhance toxicity in Drosophila melanogaster. Using an RNAi-based approach, Ercc1 was silenced, and survival was monitored after injection of an agent. As expected, bulky cross-linking DNA-modifying agents, cisplatin and chlorambucil, showed statistically significant enhanced toxicity in Drosophila with silenced Ercc1. In addition, 5-fluorouracil, which does not produce bulky lesions, showed no selective toxicity. An-Hq and An-Hq(2) showed statistically significant toxicity in Drosophila with silenced Ercc1. Examination of cytotoxicity shows renal carcinoma cell lines as a target of these agents with a median IC(50) of 1.8 ŒºM. Taken together, these data show that the designed oxidatively activated agents form distinct, bulky DNA modifications that prove difficult for cancer cells possessing an elevated reactive oxygen species phenotype to overcome. The modification produced is relatively unique among anticancer agents.",2012,"Tiffany R Bell-Horwath, Edward J Merino, Amy R Jones, Guorui Li, Stephanie M Rollmann"
Introns excised from the Delta primary transcript are localized near sites of Delta transcription,1383233,10.1083/jcb.119.3.503,"Introns excised from the primary transcript of Delta (Dl), a Drosophila neurogenic gene, accumulate to unusually high levels in embryos. High resolution in situ hybridization reveals a striking localization of the excised introns to two foci per embryonic nucleus. The number of foci can be altered by varying the number of Dl genes present in the embryonic nucleus, suggesting that the excised introns are localized near sites of Dl transcription. This conclusion is supported by the observation that larval and imaginal disc nuclei containing two copies of Dl exhibit only one focus of intron accumulation, as expected for nuclei in which homologous chromosomes are paired. Interestingly, the excised introns do not appear to diffuse away from the foci until late prophase, at which time the foci disperse into numerous small dots of hybridization. These results suggest that the excised Dl introns may be associated with a structural element within the nucleus that is dissociated during cell division.",1992,"M A Muskavitch, C C Kopczynski"
The genotoxicity of UVA irradiation in Drosophila melanogaster and the synergistic action of 8-methoxypsoralen and UVA,1499094,10.1093/carcin/13.8.1433,"To study the genotoxicity of near-ultraviolet light (UVA) on a whole body, Drosophila melanogaster larvae were irradiated with UVA and the emerging flies were examined for the mutant wing spot formation. The genotoxicity of UVA was also assayed with the in vivo DNA-repair test using males with repair-deficiency at the mei-9 and mei-41 locus and the matching repair-proficient females. Third-instar larvae were placed in a plastic Petri dish, which was covered with soft glass, and irradiated with black light at 4-5 W/m2. This irradiation resulted in an increase in mutant wing-hair spots. After a 15 h irradiation (approximately 240 kJ/m2), the mutant clone frequencies found in the adult flies (spots/wing) were: 1.68 for the small single spots, 0.38 for the large single spots and 0.11 for the twin spots, while at zero time they were 0.68, 0.06 and 0.02 respectively. On the other hand, the UVA irradiation was negative in the in vivo DNA-repair test, indicating that the UVA-induced DNA lesion may not be subject to repair by the mei-9 and mei-41 functions. The presence of 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) during the irradiation remarkably enhanced somatic mutations, and showed a strong DNA-damaging effect in the repair test. For example, a 15 h UVA irradiation with 26.7 microM 8-MOP resulted in a 14-fold increase in the number of twin spots per wing as compared with the frequency obtained on treatment with UVA alone. Treatment of the larvae with 8-MOP alone gave no mutant clones or DNA damage. A high frequency in twin spot formation was also observed in this UVA + 8-MOP treatment, indicating that extensive chromosomal recombinations took place in the somatic cells.",1992,"H Hayatsu, F Tanabe, T Negishi"
Identification of differentially expressed genes in female Drosophila antonietae and Drosophila meridionalis in response to host cactus odor,25178654,10.1186/s12862-014-0191-2,"Background: Studies of insect-plant interactions have provided critical insights into the ecology and evolution of adaptive processes within and among species. Cactophilic Drosophila species have received much attention because larval development occurs in the necrotic tissues of cacti, and both larvae and adults feed on these tissues. Such Drosophila-cactus interactions include effects of the host plant on the physiology and behavior of the flies, especially so their nutritional status, mating condition and reproduction. The aim of this work was to compare the transcriptional responses of two species, Drosophila antonietae and Drosophila meridionalis, and identify genes potentially related to responses to odors released by their host cactus, Cereus hildmannianus. The two fly species are sympatric in most of their populations and use this same host cactus in nature. Results: We obtained 47 unique sequences (USs) for D. antonietae in a suppression subtractive hybridization screen, 30 of these USs had matches with genes predicted for other Drosophila species. For D. meridionalis we obtained 81 USs, 46 of which were orthologous with genes from other Drosophila species. Functional information (Gene Ontology) revealed that these differentially expressed genes are related to metabolic processes, detoxification mechanisms, signaling, response to stimuli, and reproduction. The expression of 13 genes from D. meridionalis and 12 from D. antonietae were further analyzed by quantitative real time-PCR, showing that four genes were significantly overexpressed in D. antonietae and six in D. meridionalis. Conclusions: Our results revealed the differential expression of genes related to responses to odor stimuli by a cactus, in two associated fly species. Although the majority of activated genes were similar between the two species, we also observed that certain metabolic pathways were specifically activated, especially those related to signaling pathways and detoxification mechanisms. The activation of these genes may reflect different metabolic pathways used by these flies in their interaction with this host cactus. Our findings provide insight into how the use of C. hildmannianus may have arisen independently in the two fly species, through genetic differentiation in metabolic pathways to effectively explore this cactus as a host.",2014,"Camila M Borgonove, Rafaela Rossetti, Mateus H Santos, Carla B Cavallari, Klaus Hartfelder, Maura H Manfrin"
Analysis of the A-U rich hairpin from the intergenic region of tospovirus S RNA as target and inducer of RNA silencing,25268120,10.1371/journal.pone.0106027,"Earlier work indicated that Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) messenger transcripts, and not the (anti)genomic RNAs, are targeted by the RNA silencing machinery. Here, the predicted AU-rich hairpin (HP) structure encoded by the intergenic region (IGR) of the TSWV S RNA, and present at the 3' end of viral mRNAs, was analyzed as a target and inducer for RNA silencing. Virus-derived siRNAs (vsiRNAs) purified from virus infected plants were found to derive from all three genomic RNA segments but predominantly the ambisense M and S RNAs. Further profiling on the S RNA sequence revealed that vsiRNAs were found from almost the entire S RNA sequence, except the IGR from where hardly any vsiRNAs were found. Similar profiles were observed with the distantly related Tomato yellow ring tospovirus (TYRV). Dicer cleavage assays using Drosophila melanogaster (Dm) embryo extracts showed that synthetic transcripts of the IGR-HP region were recognized as substrate for Dicer. Transient agroinfiltration assays of a GFP-sensor construct containing the IGR-HP sequence at its 3' UTR (GFP-HP) did not show more rapid/strong silencing and profiling of the corresponding siRNAs, generated outside the context of a viral infection, still revealed relatively low levels of IGR-HP-derived siRNAs. These data support the idea that the IGR-HP is a weak inducer of RNA silencing and only plays a minor role in the amplification of a strong antiviral RNAi response.",2014,"Richard Kormelink, Marcio Hedil, Dick Lohuis, Afshin Hassani-Mehraban"
Long term expression of Drosophila melanogaster nucleoside kinase in thymidine kinase 2-deficient mice with no lethal effects caused by nucleotide pool imbalances,25296759,10.1074/jbc.M114.588921,"Mitochondrial DNA depletion caused by thymidine kinase 2 (TK2) deficiency can be compensated by a nucleoside kinase from Drosophila melanogaster (Dm-dNK) in mice. We show that transgene expression of Dm-dNK in Tk2 knock-out (Tk2(-/-)) mice extended the life span of Tk2(-/-) mice from 3 weeks to at least 20 months. The Dm-dNK(+/-)Tk2(-/-) mice maintained normal mitochondrial DNA levels throughout the observation time. A significant difference in total body weight due to the reduction of subcutaneous and visceral fat in the Dm-dNK(+/-)Tk2(-/-) mice was the only visible difference compared with control mice. This indicates an effect on fat metabolism mediated through residual Tk2 deficiency because Dm-dNK expression was low in both liver and fat tissues. Dm-dNK expression led to increased dNTP pools and an increase in the catabolism of purine and pyrimidine nucleotides but these alterations did not apparently affect the mice during the 20 months of observation. In conclusion, Dm-dNK expression in the cell nucleus expanded the total dNTP pools to levels required for efficient mitochondrial DNA synthesis, thereby compensated the Tk2 deficiency, during a normal life span of the mice. The Dm-dNK(+/-) mouse serves as a model for nucleoside gene or enzyme substitutions, nucleotide imbalances, and dNTP alterations in different tissues.",2014,"Jo√£o A Paredes, Raoul V Kuiper, Shuba Krishnan, Kjell Hultenby, Sophie Curbo, Anna Karlsson, Xiaoshan Zhou"
The intracellular redox protein MICAL-1 regulates the development of hippocampal mossy fibre connections,25007825,10.1038/ncomms5317,"Mical is a reduction-oxidation (redox) enzyme that functions as an unusual F-actin disassembly factor during Drosophila development. Although three Molecule interacting with CasL (MICAL) proteins exist in vertebrate species, their mechanism of action remains poorly defined and their role in vivo unknown. Here, we report that vertebrate MICAL-1 regulates the targeting of secretory vesicles containing immunoglobulin superfamily cell adhesion molecules (IgCAMs) to the neuronal growth cone membrane through its ability to control the actin cytoskeleton using redox chemistry, thereby maintaining appropriate IgCAM cell surface levels. This precise regulation of IgCAMs by MICAL-1 is essential for the lamina-specific targeting of mossy fibre axons onto CA3 pyramidal neurons in the developing mouse hippocampus in vivo. These findings reveal the first in vivo role for a vertebrate MICAL protein, expand the repertoire of cellular functions controlled through MICAL-mediated effects on the cytoskeleton, and provide insights into the poorly characterized mechanisms underlying neuronal protein cell surface expression and lamina-specific axonal targeting.",2014,"Yukata Yoshida, Ewout J N Groen, R Jeroen Pasterkamp, Anna Akhmanova, Rou-Afza F Gunput, Yeping Zhou, Eljo Y Van Battum, Suzanne Lemstra, Youri Adolfs, Melitta Schachner, Casper C Hoogenraad, Ka Lou Yu"
Independent Biological and Biochemical Functions for Individual Structural Domains of Drosophila Linker Histone H1,27226620,10.1074/jbc.M116.730705,"Linker histone H1 is among the most abundant components of chromatin. H1 has profound effects on chromosome architecture. H1 also helps to tether DNA- and histone-modifying enzymes to chromatin. Metazoan linker histones have a conserved tripartite structure comprising N-terminal, globular, and long, unstructured C-terminal domains. Here we utilize truncated Drosophila H1 polypeptides in vitro and H1 mutant transgenes in vivo to interrogate the roles of these domains in multiple biochemical and biological activities of H1. We demonstrate that the globular domain and the proximal part of the C-terminal domain are essential for H1 deposition into chromosomes and for the stability of H1-chromatin binding. The two domains are also essential for fly viability and the establishment of a normal polytene chromosome structure. Additionally, through interaction with the heterochromatin-specific histone H3 Lys-9 methyltransferase Su(var)3-9, the H1 C-terminal domain makes important contributions to formation and H3K9 methylation of heterochromatin as well as silencing of transposons in heterochromatin. Surprisingly, the N-terminal domain does not appear to be required for any of these functions. However, it is involved in the formation of a single chromocenter in polytene chromosomes. In summary, we have discovered that linker histone H1, similar to core histones, exerts its multiple biological functions through independent, biochemically separable activities of its individual structural domains.",2016,"Arthur I Skoultchi, Alexander V Emelyanov, Harsh Kavi, Dmitry V Fyodorov"
Genetic dissection of the Transcription Factor code controlling serial specification of muscle identities in Drosophila,27438571,10.7554/eLife.14979,"Each Drosophila muscle is seeded by one Founder Cell issued from terminal division of a Progenitor Cell (PC). Muscle identity reflects the expression by each PC of a specific combination of identity Transcription Factors (iTFs). Sequential emergence of several PCs at the same position raised the question of how developmental time controlled muscle identity. Here, we identified roles of Anterior Open and ETS domain lacking in controlling PC birth time and Eyes absent, No Ocelli, and Sine oculis in specifying PC identity. The windows of transcription of these and other TFs in wild type and mutant embryos, revealed a cascade of regulation integrating time and space, feed-forward loops and use of alternative transcription start sites.

Lack of nucleotide polymorphism in the Y-linked sperm flagellar dynein gene Dhc-Yh3 of Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans,10581278,,"We studied levels of intra- and interspecific nucleotide variation associated with a Y-linked gene in five members of the Drosophila melanogaster subgroup. Using published sequence for 348 bp of the Dhc-Yh3 gene, and degenerate PCR primers designed from comparisons of the sea urchin and Chlamydomonas flagellar dynein genes, we recovered a 1738-bp region in D. melanogaster. Analyses of sequence variation in a worldwide collection of 11 lines of D. melanogaster and 10 lines of D. simulans found only a single silent polymorphism in the latter species. The synonymous site divergence per site for Dhc-Yh3 is comparable to values for X and autosomal genes. Assuming a Wright-Fisher population model, the lack of variation is statistically less than expected using appropriately reduced estimates of theta from the X and autosomes. Because the Y chromosome encodes only six known genes, genetic hitchhiking associated with background selection is unlikely to explain this low variation. Conversely, adaptive hitchhiking, as associated with sex-ratio chromosomes, or a large variance in male fertility may reduce the polymorphism on the Y chromosome. Codon bias is very low, as seen for other genes in regions of low recombination.",1999,"W F Eanes, M Zurovcova"

Normal (C-S) flies quickly learn and remember which of two odors signals the presence of food and they are capable of retaining this information for at last eight hours. Both dunce and amnesiac mutants are able to learn, whereas mutant dunce do not reach the learning level of wild type C-S flies. Also dunce flies require more than one learning trial for sizeable learning effect. Reversal learning experiments showed that normal C-S flies and amnesiac are able to switch to a new food signal in response to a new experience, while the dunce mutation inhibits the acquisition of new information in reversal learning experiments.",1999,N J Milosevic
Migration and function of glia in the developing Drosophila eye,10393108,,"Although glial cells have been implicated widely in the formation of axon tracts in both insects and vertebrates, their specific function appears to be context-dependent, ranging from providing essential guidance cues to playing a merely facilitory role. Here we examine the role of the retinal basal glia (RBG) in photoreceptor axon guidance in Drosophila. The RBG originate in the optic stalk and have been thought to migrate into the eye disc along photoreceptor axons, thus precluding any role in axon guidance. Here we show the following. (1) The RBG can, in fact, migrate into the eye disc even in the absence of photoreceptor axons in the optic stalk; they also migrate to ectopic patches of differentiating photoreceptors without axons providing a continuous physical substratum. This suggests that glial cells are attracted into the eye disc not through haptotaxis along established axons, but through another mechanism, possibly chemotaxis. (2) If no glial cells are present in the eye disc, photoreceptor axons are able to grow and direct their growth posteriorly as in wild type, but are unable to enter the optic stalk. This indicates that the RBG have a crucial role in axon guidance, but not in axonal outgrowth per se. (3) A few glia close to the entry of the optic stalk suffice to guide the axons into the stalk, suggesting that glia instruct axons by local interaction.",1999,"U Gaul, R Rangarajan, Q Gong"
The influence of large deletions on the mutation frequency induced by tritiated water and X-radiation in male Drosophila melanogaster post-meiotic germ cells,7513799,10.1016/0027-5107(94)90294-1,"Tritium beta radiation (3H beta-radiation) in the form of tritiated water was used to induce mutations at the alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) locus in male Drosophila melanogaster post-meiotic germ cells. All 23 Adh null mutations were large deletions (> 20 kb), determined by genetic complementation and Southern blot analyses. 27 Adh null mutations have been induced by 100-kVp X-rays (Aaron, 1979) and have been genetically and molecularly characterized (Ashburner et al., 1982; Chia et al., 1985; LoMonaco et al., 1987; Mahmoud et al., 1991). In contrast to 3H beta-radiation, 100-kVp X-rays induced a bimodal distribution of Adh null mutations, intragenic mutations, < or = 250 bp, and large deletions, > 100 kb. A statistically significant difference was observed between the frequency of large deletions (23/23 or 1.0) induced by 3H beta-radiation and the frequency of large deletions (19/27 or 0.7) induced by 100-kVp X-rays. However, a statistical difference was not observed between the size distribution of the large deletions induced by 3H beta-radiation and X-rays. The relative deletion frequency (RDF) induced by 3H beta-radiation and 100-kVp X-rays was (1.0/0.7 = 1.4). The relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of these two radiation sources was 1.4, determined from the ratio of the regression coefficients of the respective 3H beta-radiation and X-ray sex-linked recessive lethal (SLRL) dose-response data. The large difference in size between the two classes of X-ray-induced Adh null mutations and the increase in mutation frequency and deletion frequency for 3H beta-radiation with respect to X-rays may indicate that the relative deletion frequency (RDF) is the molecular biological basis for the increase in the RBE for radiation sources with a mean LET value < or = 10 keV/microns.",1994,"B J Byrne, S J Kelley, W R Lee, N G Fossett, P Arbour-Reily, A B Tucker"
Evolutionary conservation of the structure and expression of alternatively spliced Ultrabithorax isoforms from Drosophila,7911773,,"In Drosophila melanogaster, alternatively spliced mRNAs from the homeotic gene Ultrabithorax (Ubx) encode a family of structurally distinct homeoprotein isoforms. The developmentally regulated expression patterns of these isoforms suggest that they have specialized stage- and tissue-specific functions. To evaluate the functional importance of UBX isoform diversity and gain clues to the mechanism that regulates processing of Ubx RNAs, we have investigated whether the Ubx RNAs of other insects undergo similar alternative splicing. We have isolated and characterized Ubx cDNA fragments from D. melanogaster, Drosophila pseudoobscura, Drosophila hydei and Drosophila virilis, species separated by as much as 60 million years of evolution, and have found that three aspects of Ubx RNA processing have been conserved. (1) These four species exhibit identical patterns of optional exon use in a region adjacent to the homeodomain. (2) These four species produce the same family of UBX protein isoforms with identical amino acid sequences in the optional exons, even though the common amino-proximal region has undergone substantial divergence. The nucleotide sequences of the optional exons, including third positions of rare codons, have also been conserved strongly, suggesting functional constraints that are not limited to coding potential. (3) The tissue- and stage-specific patterns of expression of different UBX isoforms are identical among these Drosophila species, indicating that the developmental regulation of the alternative splicing events has also been conserved. These findings argue for an important role of alternative splicing in Ubx function. We discuss the implications of these results for models of UBX protein function and the mechanism of alternative splicing.",1994,"A J L√≥pez, H M Bomze"
Geographical differentiation of allozymic variability in natural Indian populations of Drosophila melanogaster,8031295,10.1007/BF00557239,Fourteen Indian populations of D. melanogaster collected along a 22 degrees latitudinal range were analyzed electrophoretically to compare the geographical patterns of allozymic variation at 13 loci. The data show higher genetic differentiation on the basis of moderate to higher FST values and significant statistical correlation of allelic frequencies at six polymorphic loci with latitude. The results add support to the hypothesis that the occurrence of parallel or complementary latitudinal clines across different continental populations provides evidence of natural selection maintaining such clinal variation.,1994,"Shamina, R Parkash"

Limb type-specific regulation of bric a brac contributes to morphological diversity,11830570,,"The insect antenna and leg are considered homologous structures, likely to have arisen via duplication and divergence from an ancestral limb. Consistent with this, the antenna and leg are derived from primordia with similar developmental potentials. Nonetheless, the adult structures differ in both form and function. In Drosophila, one conspicuous morphological difference is that the antenna has fewer distal segments than the leg. We propose that this is due in part to the variations in the regulation of bric a brac. bric a brac is required for joint formation, and loss of bric a brac function leads to fusion of distal antennal and leg segments, resulting in fewer total segments. Here, we address how bric a brac is regulated to generate the mature expression patterns of two concentric rings in the antenna versus four concentric rings in the leg. We find that bric a brac expression is activated early throughout most of the Distal-less domain in both antenna and leg and subsequently is restricted to the distal portion and into rings. Although bric a brac expression in the antenna and in all four tarsal rings of the leg requires Distal-less, only the proximal three tarsal rings are Spineless-dependent. Thus bric a brac is regulated differentially even within a single appendage type. The restriction of bric a brac expression to the distal portion of the Distal-less domain is a consequence of negative regulation by distinct sets of genes in different limb types. In the leg, the proximal boundary of bric a brac is established by the medial-patterning gene dachshund, but dachshund alone is insufficient to repress bric a brac, and the expression of the two genes overlaps. In the antenna, the proximal boundary of bric a brac is established by an antenna-specifying gene, homothorax, in conjunction with dachshund and spalt, and there is much less overlap between the bric a brac and the dachshund domains. Thus tissue-specific expression of other patterning genes that differentially repress bric a brac accounts for antenna-leg differences in bric a brac pattern. We propose that the limb type-specific variations in expression of bric a brac repressors contribute to morphological variations by controlling distal limb segment number.",2002,"Grace Panganiban, P D Si Dong, Jessie Chu"
Neuropeptides in the nervous system of Drosophila and other insects: multiple roles as neuromodulators and neurohormones,12427481,10.1016/s0301-0082(02)00057-6,"Neuropeptides in insects act as neuromodulators in the central and peripheral nervous system and as regulatory hormones released into the circulation. The functional roles of insect neuropeptides encompass regulation of homeostasis, organization of behaviors, initiation and coordination of developmental processes and modulation of neuronal and muscular activity. With the completion of the sequencing of the Drosophila genome we have obtained a fairly good estimate of the total number of genes encoding neuropeptide precursors and thus the total number of neuropeptides in an insect. At present there are 23 identified genes that encode predicted neuropeptides and an additional seven encoding insulin-like peptides in Drosophila. Since the number of G-protein-coupled neuropeptide receptors in Drosophila is estimated to be around 40, the total number of neuropeptide genes in this insect will probably not exceed three dozen. The neuropeptides can be grouped into families, and it is suggested here that related peptides encoded on a Drosophila gene constitute a family and that peptides from related genes (orthologs) in other species belong to the same family. Some peptides are encoded as multiple related isoforms on a precursor and it is possible that many of these isoforms are functionally redundant. The distribution and possible functions of members of the 23 neuropeptide families and the insulin-like peptides are discussed. It is clear that each of the distinct neuropeptides are present in specific small sets of neurons and/or neurosecretory cells and in some cases in cells of the intestine or certain peripheral sites. The distribution patterns vary extensively between types of neuropeptides. Another feature emerging for many insect neuropeptides is that they appear to be multifunctional. One and the same peptide may act both in the CNS and as a circulating hormone and play different functional roles at different central and peripheral targets. A neuropeptide can, for instance, act as a coreleased signal that modulates the action of a classical transmitter and the peptide action depends on the cotransmitter and the specific circuit where it is released. Some peptides, however, may work as molecular switches and trigger specific global responses at a given time. Drosophila, in spite of its small size, is now emerging as a very favorable organism for the studies of neuropeptide function due to the arsenal of molecular genetics methods available.",2002,Dick R N√§ssel

Extensive gaps between these membranes are visible at the ultrastructural level. The oocyte is also mislocalized in E-APC mutant egg chambers, a phenotype that results from a failure of cadherin-based adhesion.

The completion of sequencing and annotation of the Drosophila genome has revealed that the dcp-1 gene is nested within an intron of another distinct gene, called pita, a member of the C2H2 zinc finger protein family that regulates transcriptional initiation. The dcp-1(-/-)/pita(-/-) nurse cells exhibit euchromatic nuclei (delay of apoptosis) during the late stages of oogenesis, as revealed by conventional light and electron microscopy. The phalloidin-FITC staining discloses significant defects in actin cytoskeleton arrangement. The actin bundles fail to organize properly and the distribution of actin filaments in the ring canals is changed compared to the wild type.

Testing whether male age or high nutrition causes the cessation of reproductive aging in female Drosophila melanogaster populations,15929716,10.1089/rej.2005.8.86,"Fecundity seems to stop declining and plateaus at low levels very late in Drosophila melanogaster populations. Here we test whether this apparent cessation of reproductive aging by a population, herein referred to as fecundity plateaus, is robust under various environmental influences: namely, male age and nutrition. The effect of male age on late age fecundity patterns was tested by supplying older females with young males before average population fecundity declined to plateau levels. The second possible environmental influence we tested was nutrition and whether late-life fecundity plateaus arise from a decline in the calories available for reproduction. This hypothesis was tested by comparing average daily female fecundity with both low- and high-lifetime nutrition. Both hypotheses were tested by measuring mid- and late-life fecundity for each cohort under the various environmental influences, and statistically testing whether fecundity stops declining and plateaus at late ages. These experiments demonstrate that mid- and late-life population fecundity patterns are significantly affected by the age of males and nutrition level. However, male age and nutrition level did not affect the existence of late-life fecundity plateaus, which demonstrates the robustness of our earlier findings. These results do not address any issue pertaining to the possible role, if any, of lifelong inter-individual heterogeneity in Drosophila fecundity.",2005,"Justin S Hong, Michael R Rose, Kathy M Pham, Michelle B Cung, Laurence D Mueller, Casandra L Rauser"

A comparative analysis of highly conserved sex-determining genes between Apis mellifera and Drosophila melanogaster,16755507,,"A comparison of the most conserved sex-determining genes between the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, and the honey bee, Apis mellifera, was performed with bioinformatics tools developed for computational molecular biology. An initial set of protein sequences already described in the fruit fly as participants of the sex-determining cascade was retrieved from the Gene Ontology database (http://www.geneontology.org/) and aligned against a database of protein sequences predicted from the honey bee genome. The doublesex (dsx) gene is considered one of the most conserved sex-determining genes among metazoans, and a male-specific partial cDNA of putative A. mellifera dsx gene (Amdsx) was identified experimentally. The theoretical predictions were developed in the context of sequence similarity. Experimental evidence indicates that dsx is present in embryos and larvae, and that it encodes a transcription factor widely conserved in metazoans, containing a DM DNA-binding domain implicated in the regulation of the expression of genes involved in sexual phenotype formation.",2006,"Luciano da Fontoura Costa, Adriana Mendes do Nascimento, Zil√° Luz Paulino Sim√µes, Alexandre S Cristino"
A data-driven clustering method for time course gene expression data,16510852,10.1093/nar/gkl013,"Gene expression over time is, biologically, a continuous process and can thus be represented by a continuous function, i.e. a curve. Individual genes often share similar expression patterns (functional forms). However, the shape of each function, the number of such functions, and the genes that share similar functional forms are typically unknown. Here we introduce an approach that allows direct discovery of related patterns of gene expression and their underlying functions (curves) from data without a priori specification of either cluster number or functional form. Smoothing spline clustering (SSC) models natural properties of gene expression over time, taking into account natural differences in gene expression within a cluster of similarly expressed genes, the effects of experimental measurement error, and missing data. Furthermore, SSC provides a visual summary of each cluster's gene expression function and goodness-of-fit by way of a 'mean curve' construct and its associated confidence bands. We apply this method to gene expression data over the life-cycle of Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans to discover 17 and 16 unique patterns of gene expression in each species, respectively. New and previously described expression patterns in both species are discovered, the majority of which are biologically meaningful and exhibit statistically significant gene function enrichment.

ESTIMATING THE HERITABILITY OF FLUCTUATING ASYMMETRY IN FIELD DROSOPHILA,28565236,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1998.tb03705.x,"Some studies have found intermediate heritabilities for fluctuating asymmetry (FA) in traits, but almost all of these are flawed and/or based on laboratory experiments. We therefore tested if there was heritable variation for FA in bristle and wing traits in three field collections of Drosophila melanogaster by rearing F1 s from field flies under laboratory conditions. One of the collections was reared to the F2 generation in the laboratory to compare heritability estimates from the laboratory with those from the field-laboratory comparison. Trait means indicated an increase in size under laboratory rearing. FAs increased in one collection, decreased in another collection, and showed no changes in the third collection under laboratory rearing. FAs from the collections tended to converge under laboratory conditions. Morphological traits were heritable under field conditions. However, FA was not significantly heritable for any of the individual traits or when FA was determined by combining traits. Comparisons of the two laboratory generations showed that FA heritability was low under laboratory conditions, in contrast to the morphological traits themselves. These findings suggest a very low heritability for FA in field and laboratory Drosophila. FA in bristle and wing traits may therefore be a poor indicator of genetic quality in Drosophila.",1998,"Ary A Hoffmann, Miriam J Hercus, Richard E Woods"
Potentially active copies of the gypsy retroelement are confined to the Y chromosome of some strains of Drosophila melanogaster possibly as the result of the female-specific effect of the flamenco gene,9541538,10.1007/pl00006323,"Gypsy is an endogenous retrovirus present in the genome of Drosophila melanogaster. This element is mobilized only in the progeny of females which contain active gypsy elements and which are homozygous for permissive alleles of a host gene called flamenco (flam). Some data strongly suggest that gypsy elements bearing a diagnostic HindIII site in the central region of the retrovirus body represent a subfamily that appears to be much more active than elements devoid of this site. We have taken advantage of this structural difference to assess by the Southern blotting technique the genomic distribution of active gypsy elements. In some of the laboratory Drosophila stocks tested, active gypsy elements were found to be restricted to the Y chromosome. Further analyses of 14 strains tested for the permissive vs. restrictive status of their flamenco alleles suggest that the presence of permissive alleles of flam in a stock tends to be associated with the confinement of active gypsy elements to the Y chromosome. This might be the result of the female-specific effect of flamenco on gypsy activity.",1998,"F Chalvet, A Bucheton, C di Franco, N Junakovic, A Pelisson, A Terrinoni"

Heat shock proteins in Trypanosoma cruzi: identification and localization of HSP70 and HSP60 proteins and structure of HSP60 genes (brief report),7670543,,"To identify the members of the HSP70 and HSP60 families of Trypanosoma cruzi, we analysed 35S methionine epimastigote cells by two dimensional Western blot. At 29 degrees C, an HSP70 monoclonal antibody (anti-D. melanogaster) recognized eight isotypes. At least five of these were heat-induced. Polyclonal antibody against the 65 KDa antigen (anti-M. tuberculosis) recognized three isotypes with identical molecular weights, but different microliters. Only one isoform was heat induced. The cellular distribution of HSP70 and HSP60 was studied by immunoelectron microscopy. Anti-HSP70 reactive protein was localized in the cytoplasm, mitochondria and nucleus, while anti-HSP60 protein was found in the mitochondrion and in close association with the kinetoplast. To characterize the HSP60 gene and its proteins, we isolated a genomic T. cruzi clone encoding the HSP60 gene. T. cruzi HSP60 genes could be shown to be organized in 2100 nt tandem arrays. RELP in the HSP60 genes revealed that at least three different types of HSP60 genes were encoded in the T cruzi genome. The predicted open reading frame measured exhibits about 50% identity to other HSP60 described. Expression of these HSP60 genes could not be induced by 2 hours heat shock at 37 degrees C.

Stripy Ftz target genes are coordinately regulated by Ftz-F1,19679121,10.1016/j.ydbio.2009.08.004,"During development, cascades of regulatory genes act in a hierarchical fashion to subdivide the embryo into increasingly specified body regions. This has been best characterized in Drosophila, where genes encoding regulatory transcription factors form a network to direct the development of the basic segmented body plan. The pair-rule genes are pivotal in this process as they are responsible for the first subdivision of the embryo into repeated metameric units. The Drosophila pair-rule gene fushi tarazu (ftz) is a derived Hox gene expressed in and required for the development of alternate parasegments. Previous studies suggested that Ftz achieves its distinct regulatory specificity as a segmentation protein by interacting with a ubiquitously expressed cofactor, the nuclear receptor Ftz-F1. However, the downstream target genes regulated by Ftz and other pair-rule genes to direct segment formation are not known. In this study, we selected candidate Ftz targets by virtue of their early expression in Ftz-like stripes. This identified two new Ftz target genes, drumstick (drm) and no ocelli (noc), and confirmed that Ftz regulates a serotonin receptor (5-HT2). These are the earliest Ftz targets identified to date and all are coordinately regulated by Ftz-F1. Engrailed (En), the best-characterized Ftz/Ftz-F1 downstream target, is not an intermediate in regulation. The drm genomic region harbors two separate seven-stripe enhancers, identified by virtue of predicted Ftz-F1 binding sites, and these sites are necessary for stripe expression in vivo. We propose that pair-rule genes, exemplified by Ftz/Ftz-F1, promote segmentation by acting at different hierarchical levels, regulating first, other segmentation genes; second, other regulatory genes that in turn control specific cellular processes such as tissue differentiation; and, third, 'segmentation realizator genes' that are directly involved in morphogenesis.",2009,"Jingnan Liu, Timothy Bowler, Leslie Pick, Hui Ying Hou, W Ray Anderson, Alison Heffer"
Invasive and indigenous microbiota impact intestinal stem cell activity through multiple pathways in Drosophila,19797770,10.1101/gad.1827009,"Gut homeostasis is controlled by both immune and developmental mechanisms, and its disruption can lead to inflammatory disorders or cancerous lesions of the intestine. While the impact of bacteria on the mucosal immune system is beginning to be precisely understood, little is known about the effects of bacteria on gut epithelium renewal. Here, we addressed how both infectious and indigenous bacteria modulate stem cell activity in Drosophila. We show that the increased epithelium renewal observed upon some bacterial infections is a consequence of the oxidative burst, a major defense of the Drosophila gut. Additionally, we provide evidence that the JAK-STAT (Janus kinase-signal transducers and activators of transcription) and JNK (c-Jun NH(2) terminal kinase) pathways are both required for bacteria-induced stem cell proliferation. Similarly, we demonstrate that indigenous gut microbiota activate the same, albeit reduced, program at basal levels. Altered control of gut microbiota in immune-deficient or aged flies correlates with increased epithelium renewal. Finally, we show that epithelium renewal is an essential component of Drosophila defense against oral bacterial infection. Altogether, these results indicate that gut homeostasis is achieved by a complex interregulation of the immune response, gut microbiota, and stem cell activity.",2009,"Nichole A Broderick, Sveta Chakrabarti, Bruno Lemaitre, Nicolas Buchon"
Diverse transcription influences can be insulated by the Drosophila SF1 chromatin boundary,19435880,10.1093/nar/gkp362,"Chromatin boundaries regulate gene expression by modulating enhancer-promoter interactions and insulating transcriptional influences from organized chromatin. However, mechanistic distinctions between these two aspects of boundary function are not well understood. Here we show that SF1, a chromatin boundary located in the Drosophila Antennapedia complex (ANT-C), can insulate the transgenic miniwhite reporter from both enhancing and silencing effects of surrounding genome, a phenomenon known as chromosomal position effect or CPE. We found that the CPE-blocking activity associates with different SF1 sub-regions from a previously characterized insulator that blocks enhancers in transgenic embryos, and is independent of GAF-binding sites essential for the embryonic insulator activity. We further provide evidence that the CPE-blocking activity cannot be attributed to an enhancer-blocking activity in the developing eye. Our results suggest that SF1 contains multiple non-overlapping activities that block diverse transcriptional influences from embryonic or adult enhancers, and from positive and negative chromatin structure. Such diverse insulating capabilities are consistent with the proposed roles of SF1 to functionally separate fushi tarazu (ftz), a non-Hox gene, from the enhancers and the organized chromatin of the neighboring Hox genes.",2009,"Parimal Majumder, Meena Puppali, Vladimir E Belozerov, Sharmila Roy, Dimple Bosu, Haini N Cai"
Gene expression during Drosophila melanogaster egg development before and after reproductive diapause,19463195,10.1186/1471-2164-10-242,"Background: Despite the importance of egg development to the female life cycle in Drosophila, global patterns of gene expression have not been examined in detail, primarily due to the difficulty in isolating synchronised developmental stages in sufficient quantities for gene expression profiling. Entry into vitellogenesis is a key stage of oogenesis and by forcing females into reproductive diapause we are able to arrest oogenesis at the pre-vitellogenic stages. Releasing females from diapause allows collection of relatively synchronous developing egg populations and an investigation of some of the transcriptional dynamics apparent before and after reproductive diapause. Results: Focusing on gender-biased transcription, we identified mechanisms of egg development suppressed during reproductive dormancy as well as other molecular changes unique to the diapausing female. A microarray based analysis generated a set of 3565 transcripts with at least 2-fold greater expression in females as compared to control males, 1392 such changes were biased during reproductive dormancy. In addition, we also detect 1922 up-regulated transcriptional changes after entry into vitellogenesis, which were classified into discrete blocks of co-expression. We discuss some of the regulatory aspects apparent after re-initiation of egg development, exploring the underlying functions, maternal contribution and evolutionary conservation of co-expression patterns involved in egg production. Conclusion: Although much of the work we present is descriptive, fundamental aspects of egg development and gender-biased transcription can be derived from our time-series experiment. We believe that our dataset will facilitate further exploration of the developmental and evolutionary characteristics of oogenesis as well as the nature of reproductive arrest in Drosophila.",2009,"Steven Russell, Dean A Baker"

Positive and negative regulatory elements mediating transcription from the Drosophila melanogaster actin 5C distal promoter,2123290,10.1128/mcb.10.12.6172,"The major cytoskeletal actin gene of Drosophila melanogaster, the actin 5C gene, has two promoters, the distal one of which controls synthesis of actin in a tissue- and developmental stage-specific manner. This very strong promoter has widely been used for expression of heterologous genes in cultured cells. To locate functional regulatory elements in this distal promoter, mutants of the promoter were fused to the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene and assayed for transient expression activity in cultured Drosophila embryonic Schneider line 2 cells. The results showed that the upstream end of the promoter extends to 522 bp from the transcription start site. In addition, there are two remote activating regions about 2 kb upstream. Between -522 and -379 are two regions that exert a strong negative effect. Downstream from these negative regions are at least six positive regions and a TATA element. The strongest positive determinant of the promoter was identified at -320 as AAAATGTG by footprinting and by a replacement experiment. When the relevant region was replaced by a synthetic sequence containing this element in a random context, the transient expression activity was restored. The sequence TGTATG located at -355 was also identified as a positive element by a similar replacement approach. Apparently the very high activity of this promoter is the result of the combined activities of multiple factors.",1990,"E B Keller, Y T Chung"
Catalytic implications from the Drosophila protein L-isoaspartyl methyltransferase structure and site-directed mutagenesis,14596598,10.1021/bi034891+,"Protein L-isoaspartyl methyltransferases (PIMT; EC 2.1.1.77) catalyze the S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methylation of L-isoaspartyl residues that arise spontaneously in proteins with age, thereby initiating a repair process that restores the normal backbone configuration to the damaged polypeptide. In Drosophila melanogaster, overexpression of PIMT in transgenic flies extends the normal life span, suggesting that protein damage can be a limiting factor in longevity. To understand structural features of the Drosophila PIMT (dPIMT) important for catalysis, the crystal structure of dPIMT was determined at a resolution of 2.2 A, and site-directed mutagenesis was used to identify the role of Ser-60 in catalysis. The core structure of dPIMT is similar to the modified nucleotide-binding fold observed in PIMTs from extreme thermophiles and humans. A striking difference of the dPIMT structure is the rotation of the C-terminal residues by 90 degrees relative to the homologous structures. Effectively, this displacement generates a more open conformation that allows greater solvent access to S-adenosylhomocysteine, which is almost completely buried in other PIMT structures. The enzyme may alternate between the open conformation found for dPIMT and the more closed conformations described for other PIMTs during its catalytic cycle, thereby allowing the exchange of substrates and products. Catalysis by dPIMT requires the side chain of the conserved, active site residue Ser-60, since substitution of this residue with Thr, Gln, or Ala reduces or abolishes the methylation of both protein and isoaspartyl peptide substrates.",2003,"David A Chavous, James E Knapp, Eric J Bennett, William E Royer Jr, Jens Bjerregaard, Clare M O'Connor, Alan M Friedman"
A hedgehog homolog regulates gut formation in leech (Helobdella),12620988,10.1242/dev.00395,"Signaling by the hedgehog (hh)-class gene pathway is essential for embryogenesis in organisms ranging from Drosophila to human. We have isolated a hh homolog (Hro-hh) from a lophotrochozoan species, the glossiphoniid leech, Helobdella robusta, and examined its expression by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and whole-mount in situ hybridization. The peak of Hro-hh expression occurs during organogenesis (stages 10-11). No patterned expression was detected within the segmented portion of the germinal plate during the early stages of segmentation. In stage 10-11 embryos, Hro-hh is expressed in body wall, foregut, anterior and posterior midgut, reproductive organs and in a subset of ganglionic neurons. Evidence that Hro-hh regulates gut formation was obtained using the steroidal alkaloid cyclopamine, which specifically blocks HH signaling. Cyclopamine induced malformation of both foregut and anterior midgut in Helobdella embryos, and no morphologically recognizable gonads were seen. In contrast, no gross abnormalities were observed in the posterior midgut. Segmental ectoderm developed normally, as did body wall musculature and some other mesodermal derivatives, but the mesenchymal cells that normally come to fill most of the coelomic cavities failed to develop. Taken with data from Drosophila and vertebrates, our data suggest that the role of hh-class genes in gut formation and/or neural differentiation is ancestral to the bilaterians, whereas their role in segmentation evolved secondarily within the Ecdysozoa.",2003,"William Gaffield, Marty Shankland, M Shankland, Dongling Li, D A Weisblat, Fran√ßoise Huang, David A Weisblat, Dongmin Kang"

Alternative splicing and gene duplication in the evolution of the FoxP gene subfamily,20651048,10.1093/molbev/msq182,"The FoxP gene subfamily of transcription factors is defined by its characteristic 110 amino acid long DNA-binding forkhead domain and plays essential roles in vertebrate biology. Its four members, FoxP1-P4, have been extensively characterized functionally. FoxP1, FoxP2, and FoxP4 are involved in lung, heart, gut, and central nervous system (CNS) development. FoxP3 is necessary and sufficient for the specification of regulatory T cells (Tregs) of the adaptive immune system. In Drosophila melanogaster, in silico predictions identify one unique FoxP subfamily gene member (CG16899) with no described function. We characterized this gene and established that it generates by alternative splicing two isoforms that differ in the forkhead DNA-binding domain. In D. melanogaster, both isoforms are expressed in the embryonic CNS, but in hemocytes, only isoform A is expressed, hinting to a putative modulation through alternative splicing of FoxP1 function in immunity and/or other hemocyte-dependent processes. Furthermore, we show that in vertebrates, this novel alternative splicing pattern is conserved for FoxP1. In mice, this new FoxP1 isoform is expressed in brain, liver, heart, testes, thymus, and macrophages (equivalent in function to hemocytes). This alternative splicing pattern has arisen at the base of the Bilateria, probably through exon tandem duplication. Moreover, our phylogenetic analysis suggests that in vertebrates, FoxP1 is more related to the FoxP gene ancestral form and the other three paralogues, originated through serial duplications, which only retained one of the alternative exons. Also, the newly described isoform differs from the other in amino acids critical for DNA-binding specificity. The integrity of its fold is maintained, but the molecule has lost the direct hydrogen bonding to DNA bases leading to a putatively lower specificity and possibly affinity toward DNA. With the present comparative study, through the integration of experimental and in silico studies of the FoxP gene subfamily across the animal kingdom, we establish a new model for the FoxP gene in invertebrates and for the vertebrate FoxP1 paralogue. Furthermore, we present a scenario for the structural evolution of this gene class and reveal new previously unsuspected levels of regulation for FoxP1 in the vertebrate system.",2011,"Elio Sucena, Alexandre B Leit√£o, Alekos Athanasiadis, M Em√≠lia Santos, Louis DuPasquier"

Database search revealed that RhoGAP68F contains an N-terminal Sec14 domain and a C-terminal RhoGAP domain. Rho-GTP pull-down assay demonstrated that the RhoGAP domain of RhoGAP68F inactivates RhoA but not Rac1 or Cdc42 in HEK293 cells. In addition, expression of RhoGAP68F in NIH3T3 cells suppressed LPA-induced stress fiber formation, which is mediated by RhoA.

DREF is critical for Drosophila bristle development by regulating endoreplication in shaft cells,21478632,10.1247/csf.11004,"DREF (DNA replication-related element-binding factor) plays important roles in replication and proliferation in vivo by regulating transcription of various genes. However, due to a lack of appropriate cell biological studies in vivo, roles of DREF during a single cell development are poorly understood. To address this question, we focused our attention on macrochaetes bristle development system. Utilizing cell lineage analysis focusing on a single posterior scutellar (PSC) macrochaete sensory organ precursor (SOP) lineages in combination with GAL4/UAS targeted expression system for DREF double strand RNA, we revealed that DREF plays no apparent role in differentiation process during SOP formation. Rather, DREF regulates the timing of asymmetric cell division but perhaps plays no direct role in differentiation during asymmetric cell division. Most importantly, DREF affected replication and growth in shaft cells and/or socket cells. Further analysis revealed that DREF is necessary but not sufficient for nuclear growth and protein synthesis in shaft cells. Finally, it could be demonstrated that DREF plays a critical role in regulating pcna transcription in endocycling shaft cells. All these results provide evidence that DREF plays critical roles, especially in endoreplication process of bristle development, at least in part by regulating the pcna gene expression.",2011,"Masamitsu Yamaguchi, Akihito Kawamori"
Mst1 and Mst2 protein kinases restrain intestinal stem cell proliferation and colonic tumorigenesis by inhibition of Yes-associated protein (Yap) overabundance,22042863,10.1073/pnas.1110428108,"Ablation of the kinases Mst1 and Mst2, orthologs of the Drosophila antiproliferative kinase Hippo, from mouse intestinal epithelium caused marked expansion of an undifferentiated stem cell compartment and loss of secretory cells throughout the small and large intestine. Although median survival of mice lacking intestinal Mst1/Mst2 is 13 wk, adenomas of the distal colon are common by this age. Diminished phosphorylation, enhanced abundance, and nuclear localization of the transcriptional coactivator Yes-associated protein 1 (Yap1) is evident in Mst1/Mst2-deficient intestinal epithelium, as is strong activation of Œ≤-catenin and Notch signaling. Although biallelic deletion of Yap1 from intestinal epithelium has little effect on intestinal development, inactivation of a single Yap1 allele reduces Yap1 polypeptide abundance to nearly wild-type levels and, despite the continued Yap hypophosphorylation and preferential nuclear localization, normalizes epithelial structure. Thus, supraphysiologic Yap polypeptide levels are necessary to drive intestinal stem cell proliferation. Yap is overexpressed in 68 of 71 human colon cancers and in at least 30 of 36 colon cancer-derived cell lines. In colon-derived cell lines where Yap is overabundant, its depletion strongly reduces Œ≤-catenin and Notch signaling and inhibits proliferation and survival. These findings demonstrate that Mst1 and Mst2 actively suppress Yap1 abundance and action in normal intestinal epithelium, an antiproliferative function that frequently is overcome in colon cancer through Yap1 polypeptide overabundance. The dispensability of Yap1 in normal intestinal homeostasis and its potent proliferative and prosurvival actions when overexpressed in colon cancer make it an attractive therapeutic target.",2011,"Sanford D Markowitz, Yongyou Zhang, Joseph Avruch, Earl Lawrence, Dawang Zhou, Joseph E Willis, Yi Yin, Hongtan Wu, Fernando D Camargo, Evan Barry, Dawn Dawson"

However, the Japanese population had by far the most, with five protein spots restricted to this one population, which has been observed in previous studies of private alleles in oriental populations. The mean genetic similarity (F) found among the seven populations was 0.965, with a range of between 0.956 and 0.977.

The ETS-domain transcription factor family,9570133,10.1016/s1357-2725(97)00086-1,"During recent years, several significant discoveries have been made concerning the function of ETS-domain transcription factors. This family of transcription factors was originally defined on the basis of the conserved primary sequence of their DNA-binding domains. The ETS DNA-binding domain is also conserved at the structural level and is a divergent member of the winged helix-turn-helix superfamily of DNA binding proteins. This sequence conservation is reflected by their overlapping DNA-binding specificities based on the central GGAA/T motif. In addition to DNA-protein interactions, protein-protein interactions with partner proteins often play major roles in targeting ETS-domain proteins to specific promoters. Several such partner proteins have been identified. ETS-domain proteins function as either transcriptional activators or repressors and their activities are often regulated by signal transduction pathways, including the MAP kinase pathways. Specific links between such pathways and ETS-domain proteins have been established in several different experimental systems. ETS-domain transcription factors regulate a diverse array of biological functions including mammalian haematopoiesis and Drosophila eye development.

In vivo structure-function analysis of Drosophila Hairless,9347918,10.1016/s0925-4773(97)00117-2,"Hairless plays an important role as the major antagonist in the Notch signalling pathway in Drosophila. It appears to be a direct inhibitor of the signal transducer Su(H). Hairless encodes a pioneer protein which was dissected in a structure-function analysis; a series of deletion constructs was tested for wild type and gain of function activity in the fly as well as for Su(H) binding. Thereby, the Hairless protein was subdivided into the absolutely essential Su(H)-binding domain, similarly important N- and C-terminal domains and a central antimorphic domain. Therefore, Hairless protein might have additional functions apart from Su(H) binding and may antagonize Notch mediated cell-cell communication in a more complex way than currently anticipated.",1997,"D Maier, J Marquart, I Beck, A Thompson-Fontaine, E Wurmbach, A Preiss"
The developmentally regulated Drosophila embryonic nuclear lamina protein 'Young Arrest' (fs(1)Ya) is capable of associating with chromatin,9092946,,"The Drosophila fs(1)Ya protein (YA) is an essential component of the early embryonic nuclear lamina. Mutant zygotes lacking functional YA arrest in the first division cycles following fertilization, hence having a 'Young Arrest' of their development. The nuclear lamina is thought to act as the structural backbone for the nucleus and to provide anchoring sites for interphase chromosomes. Here, we demonstrate in vitro that YA is not required for the de novo formation of nuclear structures. Since YA's sequence predicts potential DNA binding motifs, this protein may instead function to connect the lamina and chromosomes, and thus aid in organizing the nucleus. We ectopically expressed YA in polytene cells and demonstrated its association with polytene chromosomes, preferentially at interbands. Furthermore, our in vitro studies indicate that embryonic YA protein is capable of associating with decondensed chromatin. These observations suggest that YA may be required for the interaction between chromatin and the nuclear envelope during early embryogenesis.",1997,"J M Lopez, M F Wolfner"
Drosophila: the genetics of innate immune recognition and response,15032585,10.1146/annurev.immunol.22.012703.104626,"Because of the evolutionary conservation of innate mechanisms of host defense, Drosophila has emerged as an ideal animal in which to study the genetic control of immune recognition and responses. The discovery that the Toll pathway is required for defense against fungal infection in Drosophila was pivotal in studies of both mammalian and Drosophila immunity. Subsequent genetic screens in Drosophila to isolate additional mutants unable to induce humoral responses to infection have identified and ordered the function of components of two signaling cascades, the Toll and Imd pathways, that activate responses to infection. Drosophila blood cells also contribute to host defense through phagocytosis and signaling, and may carry out a form of self-nonself recognition that is independent of microbial pattern recognition. Recent work suggests that Drosophila will be a useful model for dissecting virulence mechanisms of several medically important pathogens.",2004,"Kathryn V Anderson, Catherine A Brennan"
The effect of learning on experimental evolution of resource preference in Drosophila melanogaster,15154552,10.1111/j.0014-3820.2004.tb00409.x,"Learning is thought to be adaptive in variable environments, whereas constant, predictable environments are supposed to favor unconditional, genetically fixed responses. A dichotomous view of behavior as either learned or innate ignores a potential evolutionary interaction between the learned and innate components of a behavioral response. We addressed this interaction in the context of oviposition substrate choice in Drosophila melanogaster, asking two main questions. First, will learning also evolve in a constant environment in which it always pays to show the same choice? Second, how does an opportunity to learn affect the evolution of the innate (genetic) component of oviposition substrate choice? We exposed experimental populations to four selection regimes, involving selection on oviposition substrate preference (an orange versus a pineapple medium). In two selection regimes the flies were selected for preference either for the orange medium, or for the pineapple medium. In the remaining two selection regimes the flies were also selected for preference for either orange or pineapple, but additionally could use past experience (aversion learning) to decide which medium it paid to avoid. Lines exposed to the latter selection regimes evolved improved learning ability, indicating that learning may be advantageous even if the same behavioral response is favored every generation. Furthermore, of the two selection regimes that favored oviposition on the pineapple medium, the regime that allowed for learning led to the evolution of a stronger innate preference for pineapple, than the regime that did not allow for learning. In contrast, of the two regimes that selected for oviposition on the orange medium, the one that allowed for learning led to a smaller evolutionary change of the innate preference. Thus, an opportunity to learn facilitated the evolution of innate preference under selection for preference for pineapple, but hindered it under selection for preference for orange. We discuss possible mechanisms for this effect.",2004,"Tadeusz J Kawecki, Frederic Mery"
Structure of angiotensin I-converting enzyme,15549168,10.1007/s00018-004-4239-0,"Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is a zinc- and chloride-dependent metallopeptidase that plays a vital role in the metabolism of biologically active peptides. Until recently, much of the inhibitor design and mechanism of action of this ubiquitous enzyme was based on the structures of carboxypeptidase A and thermolysin. When compared to the recently solved structures of the testis isoform of ACE (tACE) and its Drosophila homologue (AnCE), carboxypeptidase A showed little structural homology outside of the active site, while thermolysin revealed significant but less marked overall similarity. The ellipsoid-shaped structure of tACE, which has a preponderance of alpha-helices, is characterised by a core channel that has a constriction approximately 10 A from its opening where the zinc-binding active site is located. Comparison of the native protein with the inhibitor-bound form (lisinopril-tACE) does not reveal any striking differences in the conformation of the inhibitor binding site, disfavouring an open and closed configuration. However, the inhibitor complex does provide insights into the network of hydrogen-bonding and ionic interactions in the active site as well as the mechanism of ACE substrate hydrolysis. The three-dimensional structure of ACE now paves the way for the rational design of a new generation of domain-selective ACE inhibitors.",2004,"R Natesh, E D Sturrock, K R Acharya, J M van Rooyen"

To examine the hypothesis that variation in fitness among resistant and susceptible genotypes could trigger the change of genetic constitution within the fall population, we investigated density-independent population projection trajectories starting from single adult females with characteristics of chromosome-substituted lines resistant and susceptible to the three organophosphates. Results: Density-independent population projection trajectories, expressed as the ratios of the number of each chromosome-substituted line to that of line SSS, for which all chromosomes were derived from the susceptible line, showed significant declines in numbers with time for all the resistant chromosome-substituted lines.

[The chronobiology of aging: changes in the temporal-periodic order],2660454,,"Within an organism the sequence of events and processes during development, maturation, and aging is determined by endogenous and exogenous factors. The endogenous factors consist of oscillatory as well as of unidirectional mechanisms. An individual temporal order (""Eigenzeit"") is the result of coupling between various oscillators, interactions between oscillators, and unidirectional processes and of stochastic events. Age-dependent changes of the diurnal rhythms in man and mammals serve as an example for age-dependent changes of the individual temporal order. The parameter of the endogenous (= circadian) diurnal rhythms are changed during embryogenesis, postnatal development, adolescence and aging: amplitude and phase delay increase during development and decrease with age. A higher frequency (ultradian) component predominates in childhood and old age. From experiments with model oscillators, lesioned central clocks in the hypothalamus of mammals and with an arrhythmic mutant of Drosophila, it is concluded that the changes of the temporal order are due to changes in the coupling properties of circadian and higher frequency oscillators. This may be true for the coupling between exogenous periodicities (""Zeitgeber"") and endogenous clocks, their mutual interaction and their coordinative function. At present, it is not known whether these changes have consequences for human well-being and health. This may be the case, however, as concluded from indirect evidence.",1989,L Rensing

Although the sequence requirements for PREs are not well-defined, the presence of Pho, a PRE-binding PcG protein, is a very good PRE indicator. In this study, we identify two PRE-containing regions at the PcG target gene, giant, one at the promoter, and another approximately 6 kb upstream. PRE-containing fragments, which coincide with localized presence of Pho in chromatin immunoprecipitations, were shown to maintain restricted expression of a lacZ reporter gene in embryos and to cause pairing-sensitive silencing of the mini-white gene in eyes.

The signaling pathways that stimulate this gene expression have been well characterized by genetic analysis in Drosophila melanogaster, but are not well understood in most other insect species. One such pathway involves proteolytic activation of a cytokine called Sp√§tzle, which functions in dorsal-ventral patterning in early embryonic development and in the antimicrobial immune response in larvae and adults. We have investigated the function of Sp√§tzle in a lepidopteran insect, Manduca sexta, in which hemolymph proteinases activated during immune responses have been characterized biochemically. Two cDNA isoforms for M. sexta Sp√§tzle-1 differ because of alternative splicing, resulting in a 10 amino acid residue insertion in the pro-region of proSp√§tzle-1B that is not present in proSp√§tzle-1A. The proSp√§tzle-1A cDNA encodes a 32.7 kDa polypeptide that is 23% and 44% identical to D. melanogaster and Bombyx mori Sp√§tzle-1, respectively. Recombinant proSp√§tzle-1A was a disulfide-linked homodimer. M. sexta hemolymph proteinase 8 cleaved proSp√§tzle-1A to release Sp√§tzle-C108, a dimer of the C-terminal 108 residue cystine-knot domain. Injection of Sp√§tzle-C108, but not proSp√§tzle-1A, into larvae stimulated expression of several antimicrobial peptides and proteins, including attacin-1, cecropin-6, moricin, lysozyme, and the immunoglobulin domain protein hemolin, but did not significantly affect the expression of two bacteria-inducible pattern recognition proteins, immulectin-2 and beta-1,3-glucan recognition protein-2. The results of this and other recent studies support a model for a pathway in which the clip-domain proteinase pro-hemolymph proteinase 6 becomes activated in plasma upon exposure to Gram-negative or Gram-positive bacteria or to beta-1,3-glucan. Hemolymph proteinase 6 then activates pro-hemolymph proteinase 8, which in turn activates Sp√§tzle-1. The resulting Sp√§tzle-C108 dimer is likely to function as a ligand to activate a Toll pathway in M. sexta as a response to a wide variety of microbial challenges, stimulating a broad response to infection.

Gene deletion screen for cardiomyopathy in adult Drosophila identifies a new notch ligand,20203305,10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.213785,"Rationale: Drosophila has been recognized as a model to study human cardiac diseases. Objective: Despite these findings, and the wealth of tools that are available to the fly community, forward genetic screens for adult heart phenotypes have been rarely performed because of the difficulty in accurately measuring cardiac function in adult Drosophila. Methods and results: Using optical coherence tomography to obtain real-time analysis of cardiac function in awake Drosophila, we performed a genomic deficiency screen in adult flies. Based on multiple complementary approaches, we identified CG31665 as a novel gene causing dilated cardiomyopathy. CG31665, which we name weary (wry), has structural similarities to members of the Notch family. Using cell aggregation assays and gamma-secretase inhibitors we show that Wry is a novel Notch ligand that can mediate cellular adhesion with Notch expressing cells and transactivates Notch to promote signaling and nuclear transcription. Importantly, Wry lacks a DSL (Delta-Serrate-Lag) domain that is common feature to the other Drosophila Notch ligands. We further show that Notch signaling is critically important for the maintenance of normal heart function of the adult fly. Conclusions: In conclusion, we identify a previously unknown Notch ligand in Drosophila that when deleted causes cardiomyopathy. Our study suggests that Notch signaling components may be a therapeutic target for dilated cardiomyopathy.",2010,"Matthew J Wolf, Il-Man Kim, Howard A Rockman"
Cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein is a conserved target of tumor suppressor HRPT2/CDC73,20339377,10.1038/cdd.2010.32,"Parafibromin, a tumor suppressor protein encoded by HRPT2/CDC73 and implicated in parathyroid cancer and the hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor (HPT-JT) familial cancer syndrome, is part of the PAF1 transcriptional regulatory complex. Parafibromin has been implicated in apoptosis and growth arrest, but the mechanism by which its loss of function promotes neoplasia is poorly understood. In this study we report that a hypomorphic allele of hyrax (hyx), the Drosophila homolog of HRPT2/CDC73, rescues the loss-of-ventral-eye phenotype of lobe (Akt1s1). Such rescue is consistent with previous reports that hyx/parafibromin is required for the nuclear transduction of Wingless (Wg)/Wnt signals and that Wg signaling antagonizes lobe function. A screen using double hyx/lobe heterozygotes identified an additional interaction with orb and orb2, the homologs of mammalian cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein (CPEB), a translational regulatory protein. Hyx and orb2 heterozygotes lived longer and were more resistant to starvation than controls. In mammalian cells, knockdown of parafibromin expression reduced levels of CPEB1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) showed occupancy of CPEB1 by endogenous parafibromin. Bioinformatic analysis revealed a significant overlap between human transcripts potentially regulated by parafibromin and CPEB. These results show that parafibromin may exert both transcriptional and, through CPEB, translational control over a subset of target genes and that loss of parafibromin (and CPEB) function may promote tumorigenesis in part by conferring resistance to nutritional stress.",2010,"W C Chen, W Morgan, M Haj-Ali, Z-X Yu, H Mehta, L Lin, J-H Zhang, W F Simonds, E M Seigneur, L M Panicker, C D House"
A transcription factor controlling development of peripheral sense organs in C. elegans,7800042,10.1038/373074a0,"The basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins constitute a class of transcription factors thought to be important in the control of cell-type determination.

A novel MAP with a relative molecular mass of 85 kDa from Drosophila larvae was found associated with taxol-polymerized microtubules. In addition, this protein bound to mammalian tubulin in an overlay assay and coassembled with purified bovine brain tubulin in microtubule sedimentation experiments. The estimated stoichiometry of 85-kDa protein versus tubulin in the polymers was 1:5.3 +/- 0.2 mol/mol. It was shown that the 85-kDa protein bound specifically to an affinity column of Sepharose-beta II-(422-434) tubulin peptide, which contains the sequence of the MAP binding domain on beta II-tubulin. Affinity-purified 85-kDa protein enhanced microtubule assembly in a concentration-dependent manner. This effect was significantly decreased by the presence of the beta II-(422-434) peptide in the assembly assays, thus confirming the specificity of the 85-kDa protein interaction with the C-terminal domain on tubulin. Furthermore, this protein also exhibited a strong affinity for calmodulin, based on affinity chromatographic assays. Monoclonal and polyclonal anti-tau antibodies, including sequence-specific probes that recognize repeated microtubule-binding motifs on tau, MAP-2, and MAP-4 and specific N-terminal sequences of tau, cross-reacted with the 85-kDa protein from Drosophila larvae.

Survival on paraquat is positively correlated with adult lifespan. DDT resistance is uncorrelated with either paraquat resistance or lifespan. The wild lines are unexceptional with respect to average lifespan, paraquat resistance, age-specific survivorship, and leveling off of mortality rates at advanced ages, but have high levels of DDT resistance. Cluster analysis groups the wild lines with three unselected laboratory stocks in one cluster, while two long-lived elite recombinant inbred lines form a second cluster.

The system has already been extensively used to acquire data that have enabled construction of large protein interaction maps (PIMs). When combined with other data, including data being generated by other functional genomics approaches, PIMs help assign function to new proteins and delineate functional networks. Hypotheses generated in such a manner often must be tested by additional experimentation, preferably in vivo. The model organism Drosophila melanogaster has a wealth of genetic and bioinformatic tools available for such analyses. The proteome predicted from the recently sequenced Drosophila genome indicates that humans have more genes in common with Drosophila than with any other invertebrate model organism characterised to date.

Cloning and expression of the human transient receptor potential 4 (TRP4) gene: localization and functional expression of human TRP4 and TRP3,11042129,,"Mammalian homologues of the Drosophila transient receptor potential (TRP) protein have been proposed to function as ion channels, and in some cases as store-operated or capacitative calcium entry channels. However, for each of the mammalian TRP proteins, different laboratories have reported distinct modes of cellular regulation. In the present study we describe the cloning and functional expression of the human form of TRP4 (hTRP4), and compare its activity with another well studied protein, hTRP3. When hTRP4 was transiently expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells, basal bivalent cation permeability (barium) was increased. Whole-cell patch-clamp studies of hTRP4 expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells revealed a constitutively active non-selective cation current which probably underlies the increased bivalent cation entry. Barium entry into hTRP4-transfected HEK-293 cells was not further increased by phospholipase C (PLC)-linked receptor activation, by intracellular calcium store depletion with thapsigargin, or by a synthetic diacylglycerol, 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG). In contrast, transient expression of hTRP3 resulted in a bivalent cation influx that was markedly increased by PLC-linked receptor activation and by OAG, but not by thapsigargin. Despite the apparent differences in regulation of these two putative channel proteins, green fluorescent protein fusions of both molecules localized similarly to the plasma-membrane, notably in discrete punctate regions suggestive of specialized signalling complexes.

SpKAP115 is an accessory subunit of sea urchin kinesin II, an ATPase motor that transports vesicles along microtubules.

Primordial germ cell development: is the urodele pattern closer to mammals than to anurans?,8877437,,"All animals can be classified into three types depending on their modes of germ cell formation; epigenetic, intermediate and preformistic. In urodeles, which show the intermediate mode, primordial germ cells (PGCs) are morphologically recognized at first in early tailbud embryos. The PGCs, which are located within the lateral plate mesoderm, are induced as part of the regional induction of the mesoderm by the vegetal yolk endoderm. No cytologically distinctive, germ cell-specific germ plasma can be detected during early development of urodeles. 'Nuage' materials, which are specific to germ line cells in almost all animals, do, however, appear in the cytoplasm of the urodele PGCs during later embryogenesis. In contrast, PGCs in anurans are preformistically established under the influence of germ plasma. Because all germ cells, once established, show virtually identical behavior, regardless of whether different modes of germ cell formation are employed, the basic mechanism of germ cell formation and differentiation in all animals could be similar at the molecular levels. Although the molecules involved in germ cell formation in amphibians have not been identified, many aspects of germ plasm formation in anurans are similar to Drosophila, in which three classes of genes involved in germ cell formation have been identified: Class I genes are necessary for pattern specification during germ cell formation, Class II for the assembly of germ plasm components, and Class III for germ cell segregation. Assuming that germ cell formation in all animals requires the expression of all such genes, the three modes of germ cell formation mentioned above could be explained in terms of spatio-temporal expression of genes which are similar to those that have been identified in Drosophila. A tentative model of gene regulation for the three different modes of germ cell formation has been proposed in terms of temporal expression of these three classes of genes.",1996,M Wakahara
