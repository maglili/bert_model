"A behavioral odor similarity ""space"" in larval Drosophila",21227903,10.1093/chemse/bjq123,"To provide a behavior-based estimate of odor similarity in larval Drosophila, we use 4 recognition-type experiments: 1) We train larvae to associate an odor with food and then test whether they would regard another odor as the same as the trained one. 2) We train larvae to associate an odor with food and test whether they prefer the trained odor against a novel nontrained one. 3) We train larvae differentially to associate one odor with food, but not the other one, and test whether they prefer the rewarded against the nonrewarded odor. 4) In an experiment like (3), we test the larvae after a 30-min break. This yields a combined task-independent estimate of perceived difference between odor pairs. Comparing these perceived differences to published measures of physicochemical difference reveals a weak correlation. A notable exception are 3-octanol and benzaldehyde, which are distinct in published accounts of chemical similarity and in terms of their published sensory representation but nevertheless are consistently regarded as the most similar of the 10 odor pairs employed. It thus appears as if at least some aspects of olfactory perception are ""computed"" in postreceptor circuits on the basis of sensory signals rather than being immediately given by them.",2011,"Bertram Gerber, Yi-chun Chen, Linda Schmitt, Michael Schmuker, Dushyant Mishra"
In situ hybridization to somatic chromosomes in Drosophila,21880819,10.1101/pdb.top065540,"In situ hybridization was originally developed as a technique for visualizing and physically mapping specific sequences on Drosophila melanogaster polytene chromosomes. Hybridization techniques can also be used to localize sequences on smaller, diploid chromosomes, such as condensed mitotic chromosomes. Variations of the method also allow the hybridization of probes to chromosomes within intact cells and tissues, rather than to chromosomes isolated from their cellular context and flattened on slides. This article presents methods for hybridizing fluorescent probes to chromosomes in whole-mount Drosophila tissues. These methods allow the investigation of nuclear organization even at stages where chromosomes are decondensed (as in interphase) or, for other reasons, cannot be discriminated in the light microscope. Consequently, they are useful for addressing a variety of cell biological questions. In addition to enhancing our understanding of somatic chromosome organization, this experimental approach has also revealed interactions among meiotic chromosomes in Drosophila females, which spend much of meiosis in a compact ball called the karyosome. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) methods can also be used to karyotype individual nuclei using chromosome-specific markers. With appropriate fixation conditions, hybridization to chromosomal DNA can be performed in conjunction with immunostaining, allowing the colocalization of cellular or chromosomal proteins.",2011,Abby F Dernburg
Pre and postsynaptic roles for Drosophila CASK,21820054,10.1016/j.mcn.2011.07.009,"CASK ('calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase'), also known in Drosophila as 'Caki' or 'Camguk/CMG', and in C. elegans as 'Lin-2', is thought to play an important role in cell-cell junction formation and at synapses in particular. To understand the role of CASK in synapse formation and function, we functionally and morphologically analyzed Drosophila embryonic and larval glutamatergic neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) after pan-cellular and tissue-specific manipulation of CASK expression. Our results show that Drosophila CASK is associated with both pre and postsynaptic membranes. Loss of presynaptic CASK led to less evoked synaptic transmission, fewer spontaneous synaptic events, and reduced synaptic vesicle cycling. These changes were accompanied by a reduction in the number of synapses but no change in overall NMJ size. Loss of postsynaptic CASK, on the other hand, caused reduced spontaneous synaptic current amplitudes and smaller glutamate-gated currents. These changes were accompanied by loss of postsynaptic glutamate receptors, but the receptor loss was subtype-specific: Only receptors containing GluRIIA subunits were lost in CASK mutants. Receptors containing GluRIIB were unaffected.",2011,"Kaiyun Chen, David E Featherstone"
Drosophila katanin-60 depolymerizes and severs at microtubule defects,21575578,10.1016/j.bpj.2011.03.062,"Microtubule (MT) length and location is tightly controlled in cells. One novel family of MT-associated proteins that regulates MT dynamics is the MT-severing enzymes. In this work, we investigate how katanin (p60), believed to be the first discovered severing enzyme, binds and severs MTs via single molecule total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. We find that severing activity depends on katanin concentration. We also find that katanin can remove tubulin dimers from the ends of MTs, appearing to depolymerize MTs. Strikingly, katanin localizes and severs at the interface of GMPCPP-tubulin and GDP-tubulin suggesting that it targets to protofilament-shift defects. Finally, we observe that binding duration, mobility, and oligomerization are ATP dependent.",2011,"Dong Zhang, David J Sharp, Margaret M Morelli, Juan Daniel Díaz-Valencia, Megan Bailey, Jennifer L Ross"
Regulation of adult stem cell behavior by nutrient signaling,21814033,10.4161/cc.10.16.17059,"Adult stem cells play an essential role throughout life, maintaining tissue and organ function by providing a reservoir of cells for homeostasis and repair. Maintenance and activity of adult stem cells have been the focus of numerous studies that have revealed stem cell-intrinsic factors and signals from the local microenvironment that regulate stem cell behavior. A growing body of work has provided evidence that circulating, systemic factors also contribute to the regulation of stem cell behavior in numerous tissues. We have demonstrated that Drosophila male germline stem cells (GSCs) and intestinal stem cells (ISCs) respond to changes in nutrient availability, specifically amino acids. Furthermore, we have shown that insulin signaling plays an important role in mediating the effects of changes in nutritional conditions. Notably, insulin signaling is cell-autonomously required within male GSCs for maintenance. Here we discuss our data regarding the effects and mechanisms by which changes in systemic nutritional conditions may influence the maintenance and activity of adult stem cells via insulin signaling.",2011,"Lei Wang, Catherine J McLeod, D Leanne Jones"
Increased hedgehog signaling in postnatal kidney results in aberrant activation of nephron developmental programs,21816948,10.1093/hmg/ddr339,"Hedgehog (Hh) is a core signaling pathway implicated in fundamental processes during embryonic kidney development. We previously found that loss-of-function mutations in the transcription factor GLIS2, a putative vertebrate ortholog of Drosophila Ci, cause nephronophthisis type 7 in humans and mice. Kidney tubular cells in Glis2-knockout mice acquire mesenchymal phenotype, but the cellular mechanisms of this transition are unknown. Here, we demonstrate that Glis2 is a functional component of Hh signaling and is necessary to suppress this pathway in the postnatal kidney. In the epithelial compartment, Glis2 opposes Gli1 activity by binding cis-acting regulatory sequences in the 5' flanking regions of Snai1 and Wnt4, thereby inhibiting de-differentiation of tubular cells. We conclude that Glis2 is necessary to inhibit Hh signaling and to maintain the mature tubular epithelial phenotype in the adult kidney. This is the first description of a molecular mechanism that links the Hh signaling pathway to cystic kidney diseases and can open new avenues for the treatment of diverse ciliopathies.",2011,"Anton M Jetten, Ramanavelan Sakthivel, Massimo Attanasio, Binghua Li, Peter Igarashi, Julie Dai, Alysha A Rauhauser"
A Drosophila model for fetal alcohol syndrome disorders: role for the insulin pathway,21303840,10.1242/dmm.006411,"Prenatal exposure to ethanol in humans results in a wide range of developmental abnormalities, including growth deficiency, developmental delay, reduced brain size, permanent neurobehavioral abnormalities and fetal death. Here we describe the use of Drosophila melanogaster as a model for exploring the effects of ethanol exposure on development and behavior. We show that developmental ethanol exposure causes reduced viability, developmental delay and reduced adult body size. We find that flies reared on ethanol-containing food have smaller brains and imaginal discs, which is due to reduced cell division rather than increased apoptosis. Additionally, we show that, as in mammals, flies reared on ethanol have altered responses to ethanol vapor exposure as adults, including increased locomotor activation, resistance to the sedating effects of the drug and reduced tolerance development upon repeated ethanol exposure. We have found that the developmental and behavioral defects are largely due to the effects of ethanol on insulin signaling; specifically, a reduction in Drosophila insulin-like peptide (Dilp) and insulin receptor expression. Transgenic expression of Dilp proteins in the larval brain suppressed both the developmental and behavioral abnormalities displayed by ethanol-reared adult flies. Our results thus establish Drosophila as a useful model system to uncover the complex etiology of fetal alcohol syndrome.",2011,"Ulrike Heberlein, Kimberly D McClure, Rachael L French"
"In situ mechanical analysis of myofibrillar perturbation and aging on soft, bilayered Drosophila myocardium",22261050,10.1016/j.bpj.2011.10.042,"Drosophila melanogaster is a genetically malleable organism with a short life span, making it a tractable system in which to study mechanical effects of genetic perturbation and aging on tissues, e.g., impaired heart function. However, Drosophila heart-tube studies can be hampered by its bilayered structure: a ventral muscle layer covers the contractile cardiomyocytes. Here we propose an atomic force microscopy-based analysis that uses a linearized-Hertz method to measure individual mechanical components of soft composite materials. The technique was verified using bilayered polydimethylsiloxane. We further demonstrated its biological utility via its ability to resolve stiffness changes due to RNA interference to reduce myofibrillar content or due to aging in Drosophila myocardial layers. This protocol provides a platform to assess the mechanics of soft biological composite systems and, to our knowledge, for the first time, permits direct measurement of how genetic perturbations, aging, and disease can impact cardiac function in situ.",2011,"Gaurav Kaushik, Adam J Engler, Anthony Cammarato, Alexander Fuhrmann"
DAAM family members leading a novel path into formin research,22046456,10.4161/cib.4.5.16511,"Formins are an important and evolutionarily well conserved class of actin binding proteins with essential biological functions. Although their molecular roles in actin regulation have been clearly demonstrated in vitro, their functions at the cellular or organism levels are still poorly understood. To illustrate this problem, but also to demonstrate potential ways forward, we focus here on the DAAM group of formins. In vertebrates, DAAM group members have been demonstrated to be important regulators of cellular and tissue morphogenesis but, as for all formins, the molecular mechanisms underlying these morphogenetic functions remain to be uncovered. The genome of the fruitfly Drosophila encodes a single DAAM gene that is evolutionarily highly conserved. Recent work on dDAAM has already provided a unique combination of observations and experimental opportunities unrivalled by any other Drosophila formin. These comprise in vitro actin polymerisation assays, subcellular studies in culture and in vivo, and a range of developmental phenotypes revealing a role in tracheal morphogenesis, axonal growth and muscle organization. At all these levels, future work on dDAAM will capitalize on the power of fly genetics, raising unique opportunities to advance our understanding of dDAAM at the systems level, with obvious implications for other formins.",2011,"Imre Molnár, József Mihály, Catarina Gonçalves-Pimentel, Andreas Prokop, Tibor Kalmár, Natalia Sánchez-Soriano"
Evolutionary genomics of Glossina morsitans immune-related CLIP domain serine proteases and serine protease inhibitors,21055483,10.1016/j.meegid.2010.10.006,"Several species of haematophagous tsetse flies (genus Glossina) are vectors for trypanosomes, the parasitic protozoans that cause Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT). Although there was a reduced incidence of HAT in the mid 1960s, decreased disease surveillance has led to a resurgence of HAT in sub-Saharan Africa. Despite being efficient vectors for HAT transmission, the prevalence of G. morsitans infection by trypanosomes in the wild is surprisingly minimal. The precise mechanisms by which G. morsitans remain refractory to trypanosome infection are largely unknown although it has been demonstrated that G. morsitans mounts a strong immune response to invading pathogens. This study identifies G. morsitans immune-related CLIP domain serine proteases and their inhibitors, serine protease inhibitors (serpin) genes. It further establishes their evolutionary relationships with counterparts in Drosophila melanogaster, Anopheles gambiae, Bombyx mori, Manduca sexta and Culex quinquefasciatus. Multiple sequence alignments show conservation of most secondary structure elements for both CLIPs and serpins. Amino acid composition of the serpin reactive site loop (RSL) indicates that the G. morsitans serpins act through an inhibitory mechanism to the target serine protease. Similar to D. melanogaster and unlike A. gambiae, the transcriptome data suggest that G. morsitans does not contain gene expansions in their CLIP-domain serine protease and serpin families. The presence of alternatively spliced variants in the G. morsitans serpins transcriptome data mirrors that of the D. melanogaster transcriptome.",2011,"Mario Jonas, Sarah Mwangi, Edwin Murungi, Alan Christoffels"
Secreted frizzled-related proteins are required for Wnt/β-catenin signalling activation in the vertebrate optic cup,21896628,10.1242/dev.065839,"Secreted frizzled-related proteins (Sfrps) are considered Wnt signalling antagonists but recent studies have shown that specific family members enhance Wnt diffusion and thus positively modulate Wnt signalling. Whether this is a general and physiological property of all Sfrps remains unexplored. It is equally unclear whether disruption of Sfrp expression interferes with developmental events mediated by Wnt signalling activation. Here, we have addressed these questions by investigating the functional consequences of Sfrp disruption in the canonical Wnt signalling-dependent specification of the mouse optic cup periphery. We show that compound genetic inactivation of Sfrp1 and Sfrp2 prevents Wnt/β-catenin signalling activation in this structure, which fails to be specified and acquires neural retina characteristics. Consistent with a positive role of Sfrps in signalling activation, Wnt spreading is impaired in the retina of Sfrp1(-/-);Sfrp2(-/-) mice. Conversely, forced expression of Sfrp1 in the wing imaginal disc of Drosophila, the only species in which the endogenous Wnt distribution can be detected, flattens the Wg gradient, suppresses the expression of high-Wg target genes but expands those typically activated by low Wg concentrations. Collectively, these data demonstrate that, in vivo, the levels of Wnt signalling activation strongly depend on the tissue distribution of Sfrps, which should be viewed as multifunctional regulators of Wnt signalling.",2011,"Carmen Ibañez, Isabel Guerrero, Pilar Esteve, Akihiko Shimono, Paola Bovolenta, Africa Sandonìs"
Specific recognition and inhibition of Ewing tumour growth by antigen-specific allo-restricted cytotoxic T cells,21407224,10.1038/bjc.2011.54,"Background: The development of a successful immunotherapy is hampered by an ineffective T-cell repertoire against tumour antigens and the inability of the patient's immune system to overcome tolerance-inducing mechanisms. Here, we test the specific recognition and lytical potential of allo-restricted CD8(+) T cells against Ewing tumour (ET) associated antigens Enhancer of Zeste, Drosophila Homolog 2 (EZH2), and Chondromodulin-I (CHM1) identified through previous microarray analysis. Methods: Following repetitive CHM1(319) (VIMPCSWWV) and EZH2(666) (YMCSFLFNL) peptide-driven stimulations with HLA-A 0201(+) dendritic cells (DC), allo-restricted HLA-A 0201(-) CD8(+) T cells were stained with HLA-A 0201/peptide multimers, sorted and expanded by limiting dilution. Results: Expanded T cells specifically recognised peptide-pulsed target cells or antigen-transfected cells in the context of HLA-A 0201 and killed HLA-A 0201(+) ET lines expressing the antigen while HLA-A 0201(-) ET lines were not affected. Furthermore, adoptively transferred T cells caused significant ET growth delay in Rag2(-/-)γ(C)(-/-) mice. Within this context, we identified the CHM1(319) peptide as a new candidate target antigen for ET immunotherapy. Conclusion: These results clearly identify the ET-derived antigens, EZH2(666) and CHM1(319), as suitable targets for protective allo-restricted human CD8(+) T-cell responses against non-immunogenic ET and may benefit new therapeutic strategies in ET patients treated with allogeneic stem cell transplantation.",2011,"H Bernhard, D H Busch, U Thiel, S Burdach, H Conrad, S Pirson, G H S Richter, C Müller-Spahn"
The E3 ubiquitin ligase CTRIP controls CLOCK levels and PERIOD oscillations in Drosophila,21525955,10.1038/embor.2011.64,"In the Drosophila circadian clock, the CLOCK/CYCLE complex activates the period and timeless genes that negatively feedback on CLOCK/CYCLE activity. The 24-h pace of this cycle depends on the stability of the clock proteins. RING-domain E3 ubiquitin ligases have been shown to destabilize PERIOD or TIMELESS. Here we identify a clock function for the circadian trip (ctrip) gene, which encodes a HECT-domain E3 ubiquitin ligase. ctrip expression in the brain is mostly restricted to clock neurons and its downregulation leads to long-period activity rhythms in constant darkness. This altered behaviour is associated with high CLOCK levels and persistence of phosphorylated PERIOD during the subjective day. The control of CLOCK protein levels does not require PERIOD. Thus, CTRIP seems to regulate the pace of the oscillator by controlling the stability of both the activator and the repressor of the feedback loop.",2011,"Angélique Lamaze, Hsiu-Cheng Hung, Annie Lamouroux, Carine Vias, François Rouyer, Frank Weber"
Neuronal remodeling and apoptosis require VCP-dependent degradation of the apoptosis inhibitor DIAP1,21343367,10.1242/dev.062703,"The regulated degeneration of axons or dendrites (pruning) and neuronal apoptosis are widely used during development to determine the specificity of neuronal connections. Pruning and apoptosis often share similar mechanisms; for example, developmental dendrite pruning of Drosophila class IV dendritic arborization (da) neurons is induced by local caspase activation triggered by ubiquitin-mediated degradation of the caspase inhibitor DIAP1. Here, we examined the function of Valosin-containing protein (VCP), a ubiquitin-selective AAA chaperone involved in endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation, autophagy and neurodegenerative disease, in Drosophila da neurons. Strong VCP inhibition is cell lethal, but milder inhibition interferes with dendrite pruning and developmental apoptosis. These defects are associated with impaired caspase activation and high DIAP1 levels. In cultured cells, VCP binds to DIAP1 in a ubiquitin- and BIR domain-dependent manner and facilitates its degradation. Our results establish a new link between ubiquitin, dendrite pruning and the apoptosis machinery.",2011,"Yuh Nung Jan, Sebastian Rumpf, Sung Bae Lee, Lily Yeh Jan"
"Pan-neuronal knockdown of calcineurin reduces sleep in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster",21917797,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5860-10.2011,"Sleep is a unique physiological state, which is behaviorally defined, and is broadly conserved across species from mammals to invertebrates such as insects. Because of the experimental accessibility provided by various novel animal models including the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, there have been significant advances in the understanding of sleep. Although the physiological functions of sleep have not been fully elucidated, accumulating evidence indicates that sleep is necessary to maintain the plasticity of neuronal circuits and, hence, is essential in learning and memory. Calcineurin (Cn) is a heterodimeric phosphatase composed of CnA and CnB subunits and known to function in memory consolidation in the mammalian brain, but its neurological functions in the fruit fly are largely unknown. Here, we show that Cn is an important regulator of sleep in Drosophila. A pan-neuronal RNA interference-mediated knockdown of Cn expression resulted in sleep loss, whereas misexpression of the constitutively active form of a CnA protein led to increased sleep. Furthermore, CnA knockdown also impaired the retention of aversive olfactory memory. These results indicate a role for Cn and calcium-dependent signal transduction in sleep and memory regulation and may bring insight into the relationship between them.",2011,"Shoen Kume, Taro Ueno, Yoshinori Aso, Yasuhiro Nakai, Madoka Mitsuyoshi, Kazuhiko Kume, Hiromu Tanimoto, Jun Tomita, Toshiro Aigaki"
Single Drosophila ommatidium dissection and imaging,21876525,10.3791/2882,"The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has made invaluable contributions to neuroscience research and has been used widely as a model for neurodegenerative diseases because of its powerful genetics(1). The fly eye in particular has been the organ of choice for neurodegeneration research, being the most accessible and life-dispensable part of the Drosophila nervous system. However the major caveat of intact eyes is the difficulty, because of the intense autofluorescence of the pigment, in imaging intracellular events, such as autophagy dynamics(2), which are paramount to understanding of neurodegeneration. We have recently used the dissection and culture of single ommatidia(3) that has been essential for our understanding of autophagic dysfunctions in a fly model of Dentatorubro-Pallidoluysian Atrophy (DRPLA)(3, 4). We now report a comprehensive description of this technique (Fig. 1), adapted from electrophysiological studies(5), which is likely to expand dramatically the possibility of fly models for neurodegeneration. This method can be adapted to image live subcellular events and to monitor effective drug administration onto photoreceptor cells (Fig. 2).

Natural genetic variation in social niche construction: social effects of aggression drive disruptive sexual selection in Drosophila melanogaster,21508610,10.1086/659631,"Social niche construction (SNC) occurs when animals actively shape their social environments. Currently the fitness consequences of SNC are poorly understood, and no study has examined whether variation in SNC has a genetic basis. Here we report the first instance of genetic variation in SNC by showing that Drosophila male aggression shapes the social environment. We allowed flies of different genotypes to interact in complex arenas; we measured the number and sex of individuals in the groups that formed and counted instances of mating. Arenas containing more aggressive male genotypes formed groups with fewer males, demonstrating that aggressive male genotypes experienced different social environments than nonaggressive genotypes. Further, genotypes with highest mating success were those whose SNC behavior generated the social environment in which they were most adept at mating: genotypes who mate most often after winning aggressive encounters benefit from aggressive SNC, while genotypes who mate most often after losing achieve high mating rates by forgoing aggression. The presence of these alternative strategies-which were robust across eight population densities-revealed that selection on aggression and context-dependent mating was disruptive, consistent with the hypothesis that SNC can maintain genetic variation in multiple behaviors.",2011,"Brad R Foley, Julia B Saltz"

"Antigenotoxicity, cytotoxicity, and apoptosis induction by apigenin, bisabolol, and protocatechuic acid",21182433,10.1089/jmf.2010.0139,"Medicinal plants represent an important resource in new drug research. Antioxidant properties of plants can help to scavenge reactive oxygen species. The objective of this work was to evaluate the genotoxic, antigenotoxic, tumoricidal, and apoptotic effect of some major phenols (apigenin, bisabolol, and protocatechuic acid) from two medicinal plants, Matricaria chamomilla and Uncaria tomentosa. The wing spot test of Drosophila melanogaster was used to evaluate the genotoxicity and antigenotoxicity of the three phenols. The human model of HL-60 leukemia cells was used for the assessment of the cytotoxic effect, growth, and cellular viability. The apoptotic effect was evaluated using a DNA fragmentation assay based on the formation of internucleosomal units. Protocatechuic acid (0.25 and 1 mM), apigenin (0.46 and 1.85 mM), and bisabolol (0.56 and 2.24 mM) did not exhibit any genotoxic effect. The three phenols showed an antigenotoxic effect against the hydrogen peroxide effect and also exhibited tumoricidal activity. Apigenin (2.24-35.96 mM) showed a lower 50% inhibitory concentration (0.75 and 3.87 mM for the trypan blue test and WST-8 colorimetric assay, respectively) than bisabolol and protocatechuic acid.

Polyglutamine Atrophin provokes neurodegeneration in Drosophila by repressing fat,21278706,10.1038/emboj.2011.1,"Large alterations in transcription accompany neurodegeneration in polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases.

In this study, we report that the fat tumour suppressor gene mediates neurodegeneration induced by the polyQ protein Atrophin. We have monitored early transcriptional alterations in a Drosophila model of Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian Atrophy and found that polyQ Atrophins downregulate fat. Fat protects from neurodegeneration and Atrophin toxicity through the Hippo kinase cascade. Fat/Hippo signalling does not provoke neurodegeneration by stimulating overgrowth; rather, it alters the autophagic flux in photoreceptor neurons, thereby affecting cell homeostasis. Our data thus provide a crucial insight into the specific mechanism of a polyQ disease and reveal an unexpected neuroprotective role of the Fat/Hippo pathway.",2011,"Vera Volpi, Francesco Napoletano, Piera Calamita, Simona Occhi, Julien Royet, Manolis Fanto, Eric Blanc, Bernard Charroux"
Drosophila amyloid precursor protein-like is required for long-term memory,21248128,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2896-10.2011,"The amyloid precursor protein (APP) plays an important role in Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative pathology that first manifests as a decline of memory. While the main hypothesis for AD pathology centers on the proteolytic processing of APP, very little is known about the physiological function of the APP protein in the adult brain. Likewise, whether APP loss of function contributes to AD remains unclear. Drosophila has been used extensively as a model organism to study neuronal function and pathology. In addition, many of the molecular mechanisms underlying memory are thought to be conserved from flies to mammals, prompting us to study the function of APPL, the fly APP ortholog, during associative memory. It was previously shown that APPL expression is highly enriched in the mushroom bodies (MBs), a specialized brain structure involved in olfactory memory. We analyzed memory in flies in which APPL expression has been silenced specifically and transiently in the adult MBs. Our results show that in adult flies, APPL is not required for learning but is specifically involved in long-term memory, a long lasting memory whose formation requires de novo protein synthesis and is thought to require synaptic structural plasticity. These data support the hypothesis that disruption of normal APP function may contribute to early AD cognitive impairment.",2011,"Aurélie Lampin-Saint-Amaux, Bassem A Hassan, Thomas Preat, Anne-Laure Belair, Valérie Goguel, Niki Scaplehorn, Derya Ayaz"
High-content chemical and RNAi screens for suppressors of neurotoxicity in a Huntington's disease model,21909362,10.1371/journal.pone.0023841,"To identify Huntington's Disease therapeutics, we conducted high-content small molecule and RNAi suppressor screens using a Drosophila primary neural culture Huntingtin model. Drosophila primary neurons offer a sensitive readout for neurotoxicty, as their neurites develop dysmorphic features in the presence of mutant polyglutamine-expanded Huntingtin compared to nonpathogenic Huntingtin. By tracking the subcellular distribution of mRFP-tagged pathogenic Huntingtin and assaying neurite branch morphology via live-imaging, we identified suppressors that could reduce Huntingtin aggregation and/or prevent the formation of dystrophic neurites. The custom algorithms we used to quantify neurite morphologies in complex cultures provide a useful tool for future high-content screening approaches focused on neurodegenerative disease models. Compounds previously found to be effective aggregation inhibitors in mammalian systems were also effective in Drosophila primary cultures, suggesting translational capacity between these models. However, we did not observe a direct correlation between the ability of a compound or gene knockdown to suppress aggregate formation and its ability to rescue dysmorphic neurites. Only a subset of aggregation inhibitors could revert dysmorphic cellular profiles. We identified lkb1, an upstream kinase in the mTOR/Insulin pathway, and four novel drugs, Camptothecin, OH-Camptothecin, 18β-Glycyrrhetinic acid, and Carbenoxolone, that were strong suppressors of mutant Huntingtin-induced neurotoxicity.

Dyrk1A Positively Stimulates ASK1-JNK Signaling Pathway during Apoptotic Cell Death,22110360,10.5607/en.2011.20.1.35,"Dual-specificity tyrosine (Y)-phosphorylation-regulated protein kinase 1A (Dyrk1A) is the mammalian homologue of Drosophila melanogaster minibrain and its human gene is mapped to the Down syndrome critical region of chromosome 21.

Although Dyrk1A is involved in the control of cell growth and postembryonic neurogenesis, its potential role during cell death and signaling pathway is not clearly understood. In the present study, we show that Dyrk1A is activated under the condition of apoptotic cell death. In addition, Dyrk1A is coupled to JNK1 activation, and directly interacts with apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1). Moreover, Dyrk1A positively regulates ASK1-mediated JNK1-signaling, and appears to directly phosphorylate ASK1.

Epithelial tissue statistics: eliminating bias reveals morphological and morphogenetic features,21607834,10.1140/epje/i2011-11050-7,"Geometric order in quasi-two-dimensional epithelia has been extensively researched in order to identify and classify different tissues to help our understanding of how tissues form (morphogenesis) and how their formation may be influenced (tissue regeneration). However, the significance of published data -such as the distribution of numbers of cell neighbors- has been debatable because of measurement bias. We shown that such bias can be detected and corrected without detailed knowledge of the original samples, using only the biased (measured) distributions. This is true for both of the most important sources of bias: the measurement of apparent four-fold vertices and the selective preference for measuring smaller cells introduced by selecting a finite sampling window. The resulting unbiased data allows for a meaningful comparison of all available data, from different sources, taken with different experimental resolution and methodology. Conclusive evidence is found that the apparent four-fold vertices are neither distributed randomly nor oriented randomly, revealing profound differences in topological correlation between proliferating and remodeling tissues. The method is applied to measurements of Drosophila wing tissue, where it successfully disentangles distributional moments, allowing for an assessment of their relative importance, independence, and significance in tissue identification and classification.",2011,"S Hilgenfeldt, M P Miklius"
Fly meets yeast: checking the correct orientation of cell division,21705221,10.1016/j.tcb.2011.05.004,"Cell division is generally thought to be a process that produces an exact copy of the mother cell by precisely replicating its genomic DNA, doubling organelles, and segregating them into two cells. Many cell types from bacteria to human cells divide asymmetrically, however, to generate daughter cells with distinct characteristics. Such asymmetric divisions are fundamental to the lifespan of a cell, to embryonic development, and to stem cell homeostasis. Asymmetric division requires coordination of cellular asymmetry and the cell division machinery. Accumulating evidence suggests that the basic molecular mechanisms that govern this process are conserved from yeast to humans. In this review we highlight similarities in the mechanisms of asymmetric cell division in yeast and Drosophila male germline stem cells (GSCs) in the hope of extracting common themes underlying several systems.",2011,"Gislene Pereira, Yukiko M Yamashita"
Evolution of the autosomal chorion cluster in Drosophila. II. Chorion gene expression and sequence comparisons of the s16 and s19 genes in evolutionarily distant species,2509714,10.1007/BF02100110,"We present a total of 13 kb of DNA sequences, encompassing autosomal chorion genes and their flanking DNA in four species of the genus Drosophila. Against a background of extensive divergence in introns and even in parts of the coding regions, islands of strong conservation are evident in the proximal 5' flanking and 5' untranslated sequences. An extragenic region of strong conservation is seen downstream of the last chorion gene in the autosomal cluster. The conserved DNA elements may be related to the conserved regulatory features of this cluster, including gene amplification and tissue- and temporally regulated transcription.",1989,"M G Fenerjian, F C Kafatos, D King, J C Martínez-Cruzado, C Swimmer"
Identification of a kinesin-like microtubule-based motor protein in Dictyostelium discoideum,2531077,,"Dictyostelium discoideum, a unicellular eukaryote amenable to both biochemical and genetic dissection, provides an attractive system for studying microtubule-based transport. In this work, we have identified microtubule-based motor activities in Dictyostelium cell extracts and have partially purified a protein that induces microtubule translocation along glass surfaces. This protein, which sediments at approximately 9S in sucrose density gradients and is composed of a 105 kd polypeptide, generates anterograde movement along microtubules that is insensitive to 5 mM NEM (N-ethyl-maleimide) but sensitive to 200 microM vanadate, and has similar nucleotide-dependent microtubule binding properties to those of kinesins purified from mammals, sea urchin and Drosophila. This kinesin-like molecule from Dictyostelium, however, is immunologically distinct from bovine and squid neuronal kinesins and supports microtubule movement on glass at four-fold greater velocities (2.0 versus 0.5 microns/sec). Furthermore, AMP-PNP (adenylyl imidodiphosphate), which promotes attachment of previously characterized kinesins to microtubules, decreases the affinity of the Dictyostelium kinesin homolog for microtubules. Thus, an AMP-PNP-induced rigor binding may not be a characteristic of kinesins from lower eukaryotes.",1989,"R D Vale, G McCaffrey"
Microtubule polarities indicate that nucleation and capture of microtubules occurs at cell surfaces in Drosophila,2925791,10.1083/jcb.108.4.1445,"Hook decoration with pig brain tubulin was used to assess the polarity of microtubules which mainly have 15 protofilaments in the transcellular bundles of late pupal Drosophila wing epidermal cells. The microtubules make end-on contact with cell surfaces. Most microtubules in each bundle exhibited a uniform polarity. They were oriented with their minus ends associated with their hemidesmosomal anchorage points at the apical cuticle-secreting surfaces of the cells. Plus ends were directed towards, and were sometimes connected to, basal attachment desmosomes at the opposite ends of the cells. The orientation of microtubules at cell apices, with minus ends directed towards the cell surface, is opposite to the polarity anticipated for microtubules which have elongated centrifugally from centrosomes. It is consistent, however, with evidence that microtubule assembly is nucleated by plasma membrane-associated sites at the apical surfaces of the cells (Mogensen, M. M., and J. B. Tucker. 1987. J. Cell Sci. 88:95-107) after these cells have lost their centriole-containing, centrosomal, microtubule-organizing centers (Tucker, J. B., M. J. Milner, D. A. Currie, J. W. Muir, D. A. Forrest, and M.-J. Spencer. 1986. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 41:279-289). Our findings indicate that the plus ends of many of these apically nucleated microtubules are captured by the basal desmosomes. Hence, the situation may be analogous to the polar-nucleation/chromosomal-capture scheme for kinetochore microtubule assembly in mitotic and meiotic spindles. The cell surface-associated nucleation-elongation-capture mechanism proposed here may also apply during assembly of transcellular microtubule arrays in certain other animal tissue cell types.",1989,"H Stebbings, J B Tucker, M M Mogensen"

Cloning and characterization of variable-sized gypsy mobile elements in Drosophila melanogaster,2550982,10.1016/0147-619x(89)90032-2,"A cosmid genomic library from a known gypsy-induced forked mutation, f1, was screened by 32P-labeled gypsy transposable element. Of more than 250 positive clones we randomly selected 21 for in situ hybridization to wild-type polytene chromosomes. Two clones hybridized to region 15F on the X-chromosome, the cytological position of forked. A third clone hybridized to at least 17 sites on the chromosomes indicating the presence of repetitive sequences in the gypsy flanking DNA. All clones labeled the centromeric regions heavily. Ten clones, including the two hybridizing at 15F, were chosen for further analysis, and restriction mapping allowed us to place them into three groups: (1) full-length, (2) slightly diverging, and (3) highly diverging gypsy elements. Group (2) is missing the XbaI site in both their long terminal repeats (LTRs) as well as the middle HindIII site; four of these gypsy elements also have a approximately 100-bp deletion at the 5' LTR. The group (3) gypsy transposons are missing one LTR and also have highly diverging DNA sequences. The restriction analyses further imply that most of these different gypsy elements are present in more than one copy in the genome of the f1 stock used in this study. The results raise intriguing questions regarding the significance of transposable elements in evolution and biological functions.",1989,"S Andersson, A Lambertsson, T Johansson"
Single strand DNA cleavage reaction of duplex DNA by Drosophila topoisomerase II,2547764,,"A unique reaction for type II DNA topoisomerase is its cleavage of a pair of DNA strands in concert. We show however, that in a reaction mixture containing a molar excess of EDTA over Mg2+, or when Mg2+ is substituted by Ca2+, Mn2+, or Co2+, the enzyme cleaves only one rather than both strands. These results suggest that the divalent cations may play an important role in coordinating the two subunits of DNA topoisomerase II during the strand cleavage reaction. The single strand and the double strand cleavage reactions are similar in the following aspects: both require the addition of a protein denaturant, can be reversed by low temperature or high salt, and a topoisomerase II molecule is attached covalently to the 5' phosphoryl end of each broken DNA strand. Furthermore, the single strand cleavage sites share a similar sequence preference with double strand cleavage sites. There is, however, a strand bias for the single strand cleavage reaction. We show also that under single strand cleavage conditions, topoisomerase II still possesses a low level of double strand passage activity: it can introduce topological knots into both covalently closed or nicked DNA rings, and change the linking number of a plasmid DNA by steps of two. The implication of this observation on the sequential cleavage of the two strands of the DNA duplex during the normal DNA double strand passage process catalyzed by type II DNA topoisomerases is discussed.",1989,"M Sander, M P Lee, T S Hsieh"
Immunological and molecular characterization of Go alpha-like proteins in the Drosophila central nervous system,2509464,,"The alpha subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins are responsible for the coupling of receptors for a wide variety of stimuli to a number of intracellular effector systems. In the nervous system of vertebrates, high levels of a specific class of G protein (Go alpha) are expressed. The alpha subunit of Go serves as a substrate for modification by pertussis toxin (PTX). In this report, we demonstrate that the Drosophila heads contain high levels of a 40-kDa PTX substrate. Modification of this protein by PTX is modulated in a manner similar to that observed for vertebrate G proteins. The PTX substrate in Drosophila is also recognized specifically by antibodies raised against peptide sequences found specifically in vertebrate Go alpha. Vertebrate Go alpha probes were used to identify a Drosophila cDNA coding for a potential PTX substrate with high sequence identity (82%) to vertebrate Go alpha. An additional cDNA coding for a related Go alpha has also been isolated. The two cDNAs differ only in the 5'-untranslated and amino-terminal regions of the protein. This observation, in addition to Northern analysis, suggests that alternate splicing may generate a variety of Go alpha-like proteins in Drosophila. In situ hybridization of specific probes to tissue sections indicates that the mRNAs coding for Go alpha-like proteins in Drosophila are expressed primarily in neuronal cell bodies and, at lower levels, in the eyes.",1989,"F Quan, N C Thambi, M Forte, A Spiegel, W J Wolfgang"

Bouillie bordelaise, Benlate and Euparène slowed down the larval development and the emergence period was longer, according to the doses. Bouillie bordelaise was always the most toxic fungicide and Dithane the least one. The sex-ratio was not disturbed with Bouillie bordelaise. With Benlate and Euparène, the females were more sensitive than the males, while Dithane was more toxic towards males.

Properties of ShB A-type potassium channels expressed in Shaker mutant Drosophila by germline transformation,2484347,10.1016/0896-6273(89)90246-8,"We have used P element-mediated germline transformation to express ShB channels in Shaker mutant Drosophila and have examined their properties by patch-clamp of embryonic myotubes.

Northern blots revealed that transformed DNA is efficiently transcribed in response to heat shock. Cultured myotubes from the transformants produced large A-type potassium currents in response to heat shock. Although qualitatively similar to native Shaker A-currents in wild-type myotubes, transformant A-current inactivates more rapidly and recovers from inactivation more rapidly, similar to ShB channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes.

Here I show that two homeotic genesUltrabithorax (Ubx) andSex combs reduced (Scr) can be ectopically expressed in the trunk region of embryos lackingspalt gene function. These results suggest thatspalt has a general role in ensuring the correct spatial expression of other homeotic genes and hence could be another member of thePolycomb class of regulatory genes.,1989,Jordi Casanova

Transposition-mediated transcriptional overexpression as a mechanism of insecticide resistance,9393432,10.1007/s004380050578,"It has been proposed that amplification of genes for esterase that provide resistance to insecticides may originate from transposition events. To test this hypothesis, we have constructed a minigene coding for a soluble acetylcholinesterase under the control of a nontissue-specific promoter (hsp70). When introduced into Drosophila, the gene is expressed in all tissues and the extra acetylcholinesterase produced confers a low level of insecticide resistance (twofold). The minigene was mobilized by crossing the initial transformant with a strain providing a source of P-element transposase. After 34 generations of exposure to the organophosphate parathion, we obtained a strain with a higher resistance (fivefold). This strain had only one extra Ace gene, which overexpressed acetylcholinesterase. Thus, following transposition, resistance resulted from the overexpression of a single copy of the gene and not from gene amplification.",1997,"S Berrada, D Fournier"
Physiological mechanisms of evolved desiccation resistance in Drosophila melanogaster,9225453,,"We investigated physiological characters associated with water balance in laboratory populations of Drosophila melanogaster selected for resistance to desiccating conditions for over 100 generations. Five replicate, outbred, desiccation-selected (D) populations were compared with their control (C) populations. Water loss rates of female D flies were approximately 40% lower than those of C females. Although excretory water loss was reduced in desiccation-selected flies, it comprised less than 10% of total water loss, indicating that the D populations have evolved reduced cuticular and/or respiratory water loss rates. Total surface lipid amounts did not differ between the C and D flies. Cuticular hydrocarbons from D flies were longer than those from C flies and melted at slightly higher temperatures, possibly contributing to reduced water loss rates. Desiccation-selected flies contained approximately 30% more bulk water than controls, as well as more glycogen. However, total metabolic water stores did not differ between the stocks owing to higher lipid levels in the C populations. The ability to tolerate water loss, as measured by water content at the time of death, did not differ between D and C flies. Thus, evolution of increased desiccation resistance has occurred by multiple physiological mechanisms, but some potential adaptive differences have not evolved.",1997,"M R Rose, A K Chippindale, A G Gibbs"
[Developmental genes],9181124,,"In the present review article, we have attempted to define and class the so called ""developmental genes"". This designation applies to genes whose activity is involved in lineage determination, in differentiation pathways or in the modes of tissue or organ formation. A special emphasis has been given to genes controlling the body plan in the course of development. Three main subclasses of such genes are described: genes involved in very early development by establishing the anteroposterior or dorso-ventral axes of the embryo (or of the insect larva); segmentation genes; homeotic genes containing an homeodomain (HD) motif and homeotic-related genes (with a ""LIM"" or ""PAX"" motif). While classical (HD containing) homeotic genes were initially discovered and studied in drosophila, their general occurrence in many other species, particularly in vertebrates was soon reported. They are characterized phylogenetically speaking, by a high degree of sequence similarities and chromosomal organization, although their number appears much greater in vertebrates than in insects due to successive duplication and chromosomal distribution events. In vertebrates they are essentially involved in the development of the central nervous system. Large varieties of genes with ""LIM"" or ""PAX"" motifs have been reported, and many subclasses can be distinguished depending upon the presence or absence of distinct peptidic motifs within the genes under concern. The peptidic domains encoded by the LIM motifs include ""Zn finger"" containing varieties which are involved in protein-protein interactions. The roles of genes with a LIM motif vary according to the type of sub-variety (organization of the central nervous system; axonal distribution of peripheric nerves at distinct levels of the spinal cord, control of tissue differentiation, etc.). ""Pax"" genes include a DNA binding domain (encoded by the ""paired"" motif) with variable sequences and organization, which is sometime in the vicinity of an homeodomain. Generally speaking ""Pax"" genes behave like controlling elements in the development of the brain or of tissues derived from the neural crest.",1997,F Gros
The influence of 2-propanol and acetone on oviposition rate and oviposition site preference for acetic acid and ethanol of Drosophila melanogaster,9210788,10.1023/a:1025697627556,"Drosophila melanogaster strains, homozygous for the alcohol dehydrogenase alleles AdhF, AdhS, and Adhn4 respectively, were tested for oviposition site preference with a Multiple Choice Device consisting of 18 patches per choice disk. Equal numbers of patches with ethanol-, acetic acid-, and water-supplemented medium were offered simultaneously. Patches with acetic acid-supplemented medium were chosen predominantly as oviposition sites. Pretreatment of flies with increasing concentrations of 2-propanol to inhibit alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) activity resulted not only in a decreasing choice of acetic acid patches, but also in the laying of a decreasing number of eggs. Adh-null mutant flies showed a similar change in behavior pattern after 2-propanol treatment. Therefore it was concluded that ADH activity is not involved primarily in oviposition site preference behavior. A complicating factor is acetone, the oxidation product of 2-propanol, which had an even larger impact on egg production. However, differences in ADH allozymes with respect to biochemical oxidation capacity of secondary alcohols will not necessarily lead to differences between the Adh genotypes in oviposition rates or apparent changes in preferences, due to additional biochemical differences in inhibition rates by acetone of the various allozymes and other enzyme systems.",1997,K T Eisses

We now identify a third, abundant, integral component of stored mRNP particles, Xp54, which belongs to the family of DEAD-box RNA helicases. Xp54 was first detected by its ability to photocrosslink ATP. Subsequent sequence analysis identifies Xp54 as a member of a helicase subfamily which includes: human p54, encoded at a chromosomal breakpoint in the B-cell lymphoma cell line, RC-K8; Drosophila ME31B, encoded by a maternally-expressed gene, and Saccharomyces pombe Ste13, cloned by complementation of the sterility mutant ste13.

We measured ovariole number, and competitive fitness and its components, for 48 homozygous chromosome 3 substitution lines in a standard inbred background; and body size in a sample of 15 chromosome 3 substitution lines. We found significant segregating genetic variation for ovariole number, with a broad-sense heritability (H2 ) of 0.403 and correspondingly high coefficients of genetic variation (CVC = 20.8) and residual variation (CVR = 25.3). Estimates of quantitative genetic parameters for body size (H2 = 0.191, CVG = 2.15, and CVR = 3.87) are similar to those previously reported for this trait. Although the isogenic chromosome 3 substitution lines varied significantly for components of fitness, there was no significant linear or quadratic association of ovariole number and body size with fitness. There was, however, highly significant sex × genotype interaction for fitness among these lines. This special case of genotype × environment interaction for fitness may contribute to the maintenance of genetic variation for fitness in natural populations.",1997,"Marta L Wayne, Trudy F C Mackay, J Brant Hackett"

That raises the question whether loss of the normal gene product might set into motion a series of events typical of the normal aging process.

Comparison with two controls, one cryopreserved and the other kept as the experimental populations but with long generation time, showed that the number of surviving offspring per female declined by 0.2% and 2.0% per generation under benign and harsh, competitive conditions, respectively.

Four genes were mapped by radioactive in situ hybridization: AMH (Anti-Müllerian Hormone) and WT1 (Wilms' Tumor gene 1) were both mapped to pig chromosome 2 (SSC2) in the q14-->q21 and p14-->q11 regions, placental CYP19 (cytochrome P450, subfamily XIX) and FTZF1 (fushi tarazu factor [Drosophila] homolog 1, alias SF1 [steroidogenic factor 1]) to pig chromosome 1 (SSC1) in the q14-->q17 and q210-->q211 regions respectively. Four other genes were regionally located by PCR analysis on a cytogenetically characterized porcine somatic cell hybrid panel: a second CYP19 gene (expressed in embryo) was mapped to porcine 1q12-->q17, AHC (alias DAX1, adrenal hypoplasia congenital) to porcine Xp24, SOX2 and SOX9 (SRY sex determining region Y-box 2 and 9) to 13q23-->q41 and 12p13-->p11 respectively.

[Cytogenetic and cytobiophysical study of temperature adaptation and heterosis mechanisms in Drosophila melanogaster Meig],9289417,,"The degree of polyteny of giant chromosomes and electrokinetic properties of cell nuclei salivary glands of Drosophila melanogaster were studied in relation to genotype and rearing temperature. Inbred and selected Drosophila lines and interlinear F1 hybrids were used. The experiments were conducted in three temperature regimes: 25 (control), 18, and 28 degrees C. At low (18 degrees C) and high (28 degrees C) temperatures, the degree of polyteny and number of electronegative nuclei was respectively higher and lower than in the control. The correlation of these parameters with a number of adaptive traits was studied. The results suggest that chromosome polyteny and nuclear electrokinetic potential play a significant role in heterosis and adaptation of Drosophila melanogaster to adverse temperatures.",1997,"V G Shakhbazov, S N Nepeĭvoda, V Iu Strashniuk, S Al'-Khamed"
Cloning and characterization of murine glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor inducible transcription factor (MGIF),9348334,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.17-22-08657.1997,"The potent neurotrophic factor glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) is a distant member of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily of proteins. We report a transcription factor that is the first nuclear protein known to be induced by GDNF, thus designated murine GDNF inducible factor (mGIF). The cDNA was cloned in the course of investigating transcription factors that bind to Sp1 consensus sequences, using the in situ filter detection method, and it was found to encode a protein having the same C2-H2 zinc finger motif as Sp1. Sequence analysis indicated that mGIF is homologous to the human TGF-beta inducible early gene (TIEG) and human early growth response gene-alpha (EGR-alpha). mGIF is widely distributed in the adult mouse with high mRNA levels in kidney, lung, brain, liver, heart, and testis. In the adult brain, mGIF is abundantly expressed in hippocampus, cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and amygdala with lower amounts in striatum, nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle, thalamus, and substantia nigra. During development, mGIF mRNA also has a wide distribution, including in cerebral cortex, cerebellar primordium, kidney, intestine, liver, and lung. GDNF induces the expression of mGIF rapidly and transiently both in a neuroblastoma cell line and in primary cultures of rat embryonic cortical neurons. Co-transfection of the Drosophila SL2 cells using mGIF expression plasmid and reporter constructs having Sp1 binding sites indicated that mGIF represses transcription from a TATA-containing as well as from a TATA-less promoter. These observations suggest that the zinc finger transcription factor mGIF could be important in mediating some of the biological effects of GDNF.",1997,"S Yajima, S H Lee, K Mizuno, Y Hara, M M Mouradian, C H Lammers"
Nuclear polarity and nuclear trafficking in Drosophila,15001111,10.1006/scdb.1996.0126,"There has been considerable progress in understanding the mechanism of movement of proteins and RNA between the nucleus and cytoplasm in single cells and in vitro. Recently, some components of the nuclear trafficking machinery have also been identified in Drosophila melanogaster allowing the study of phenotypes of mutant trafficking genes during multicellular development.

Family of Ebf/Olf-1-related genes potentially involved in neuronal differentiation and regional specification in the central nervous system,9389446,10.1002/(SICI)1097-0177(199711)210:3<191::AID-AJA1>3.0.CO;2-B,"Two novel mouse genes, Ebf2 and Ebf3, have been identified which show high similarity to the rodent Ebf/Olf-1 and the Drosophila collier genes. The strong conservation of the protein regions corresponding to the DNA binding and dimerisation domains previously defined in Ebf strongly suggests that Ebf2 and Ebf3 also constitute DNA sequence-specific transcription factors. Determination of the chromosomal locations of the two genes indicated that the different members of this novel mouse multigene family are not clustered. A detailed analysis of the expression of each of the three Ebf genes in the developing central nervous system revealed partially overlapping patterns with two salient features: 1) In the region extending from the midbrain to the spinal cord, the expression of the three genes correlated with neuronal maturation, with a general activation in early post-mitotic cells, followed by specific patterns of extinction also consistent with the neurogenic gradient. 2) In the forebrain area, although the patterns of expression of the Ebf genes also reflected neuronal maturation, they appeared in addition to be region specific. These data suggest that Ebf genes may be involved in the control of neuronal differentiation in the CNS and in enforcing regional diversity in populations of post-mitotic forebrain neurons.",1997,"C Vesque, P Charnay, S Garel, F Marín, M G Mattéi, A Vincent"
A steroid-triggered switch in E74 transcription factor isoforms regulates the timing of secondary-response gene expression,9114033,10.1073/pnas.94.9.4582,"The steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (referred to here as ecdysone) directs Drosophila metamorphosis by activating a series of genetic regulatory hierarchies. ETS domain transcription factors encoded by the ecdysone-inducible E74 early gene, E74A and E74B, act at the top of these hierarchies to coordinate the induction of target genes. We have ectopically expressed these E74 isoforms to understand their regulatory functions during the onset of metamorphosis. We show that E74 can regulate its own transcription, most likely through binding sites within its gene. Ectopic expression of E74B can partially repress the E78B and DHR3 orphan receptor genes, suggesting a role for E74 in the appropriate timing of early-late gene expression. Furthermore, E74A is both necessary and sufficient for E78B induction, implicating E74A as a key regulator of E78B expression. We also show, consistent with our studies of E74 loss-of-function mutations, that E74B is a potent repressor of late gene transcription and E74A is sufficient to prematurely induce the L71-1 late gene. However, ectopic expression of both Broad-Complex and E74A activators in an E74B mutant background is not sufficient to prematurely induce all late genes, indicating that other factors contribute to this regulatory circuit. These observations demonstrate that the steroid-triggered switch in E74 transcription factor isoforms plays a central role in the proper timing of secondary-response gene expression.",1997,"C S Thummel, J C Fletcher, P P D'Avino"
Genetic variation in the expression of the six hsp genes in the presence of heat shock in Drosophila melanogaster,9248044,10.1266/ggs.72.19,"Genetic variation in total mRNA level of the six hsp genes (hsp22, hsp23, hsp26, hsp27, hsp70 and hsp82) in the presence of heat shock was investigated by using seventy-four second- and seventy third-chromosome lines of Drosophila melanogaster which have the same genetic background derived from a highly inbred stock. There was significant variation in all the six hsp genes for both the second- and third-chromosome lines except for the hsp22 gene of the third-chromosome lines. Although all the structural genes of the heat shock proteins are localized on the third chromosome, the estimates of genetic variance for the second-chromosome lines were larger than those for the third-chromosome lines. Highly significant correlations between total mRNA level of the different hsp genes in all the combinations of the six hsp genes using the second-chromosome lines were found, but some of correlations for the third-chromosome lines were not significant. These results suggest that some second chromosome variants have similar effects on the expression of the different genes.",1997,"Y Otsuka, T S Takano, T Yamazaki"
"Toll, a muscle cell surface molecule, locally inhibits synaptic initiation of the RP3 motoneuron growth cone in Drosophila",9108372,,"Toll, a transmembrane molecule with extracellular leucine-rich repeats, is dynamically expressed by the Drosophila embryonic musculature. Growth cones of RP3 and other motoneurons normally grow past Toll-positive muscle cells and innervate more distal muscle cells, which have down-regulated their Toll expression. In this study, we show that reciprocal genetic manipulations of Toll proteins can produce reciprocal RP3 phenotypes. In Toll null mutants, the RP3 growth cone sometimes innervates incorrect muscle cells, including those that are normally Toll-positive. In contrast, heterochronic misexpression of Toll in the musculature leads to the same growth cone reaching its correct target region but delaying synaptic initiation. We propose that Toll acts locally to inhibit synaptogenesis of specific motoneuron growth cones and that both temporal and spatial control of Toll expression is crucial for its role in development.",1997,"D Rose, A Chiba, J Cho, H Kose, X Zhu, B Hoang"
Role of the stimulatory proteins Sp1 and Sp3 in the regulation of transcription of the rat pyruvate kinase M gene,9128739,10.1111/j.1432-1033.1997.00174.x,Site-directed mutagenesis of cis-regulatory elements in the 5' flanking region of the rat pyruvate kinase M gene revealed that two out of the three GC boxes (-133/-124 and -48/-39) are involved in the stimulation of a core promoter (-35/+46). These two regions were also protected in DNaseI footprinting assays. Sp1 and Sp3 were identified as binding proteins to all three GC boxes by supershift experiments. Cotransfections in Drosophila SL2 cells revealed a strong stimulatory function of Sp1 and a synergistic effect of Sp3 to Sp1 in the activation of the pyruvate kinase M promoter. No inhibitory effect of Sp3 was detected. These data indicate that binding of Sp1 at two GC boxes is required for full promoter activity of the pyruvate kinase M gene and thus contributes to the observed cell-cycle-dependent expression of this enzyme in proliferating rat thymocytes.,1997,"K Brand, C Weigert, R Netzker"
Mutation in the Jak kinase JH2 domain hyperactivates Drosophila and mammalian Jak-Stat pathways,9032284,10.1128/mcb.17.3.1562,"The Jak (Janus) family of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases plays a critical role in cytokine signal transduction pathways. In Drosophila melanogaster, the dominant hop(Tum-l) mutation in the Hop Jak kinase causes leukemia-like and other developmental defects. Previous studies have suggested that the Hop(Tum-l) protein might be a hyperactive kinase. Here, we report on the new dominant mutation hop(T42), which causes abnormalities that are similar to but more extreme than those caused by hop(Tum-l). We determined that Hop(T42) contains a glutamic acid-to-lysine substitution at amino acid residue 695 (E695K). This residue occurs in the JH2 (kinase-like) domain and is conserved among all Jak family members. We determined that Hop(Tum-1) and Hop(T42) both hyperphosphorylated and hyperactivated D-Stat when overexpressed in Drosophila cells. Moreover, we found that the hop(T42) phenotype was partially rescued by a reduction of wild-type D-stat activity. Finally, generation of the corresponding E695K mutation in murine Jak2 resulted in increased autophosphorylation and increased activation of Stat5 in COS cells. These results demonstrate that the mutant Hop proteins do indeed have increased tyrosine kinase activity, that the mutations hyperactivate the Hop-D-Stat pathway, and that Drosophila is a relevant system for the functional dissection of mammalian Jak-Stat pathways. Finally, we propose a model for the role of the Hop-D-Stat pathway in Drosophila hematopoiesis.",1997,"C R Dearolf, T M Roberts, W P Hanratty, A D D'Andrea, P Rose, S Lee, H Luo, D Barber"
Targeted gene expression as a means of altering cell fates and generating dominant phenotypes,8223268,,"We have designed a system for targeted gene expression that allows the selective activation of any cloned gene in a wide variety of tissue- and cell-specific patterns. The gene encoding the yeast transcriptional activator GAL4 is inserted randomly into the Drosophila genome to drive GAL4 expression from one of a diverse array of genomic enhancers. It is then possible to introduce a gene containing GAL4 binding sites within its promoter, to activate it in those cells where GAL4 is expressed, and to observe the effect of this directed misexpression on development. We have used GAL4-directed transcription to expand the domain of embryonic expression of the homeobox protein even-skipped. We show that even-skipped represses wingless and transforms cells that would normally secrete naked cuticle into denticle secreting cells. The GAL4 system can thus be used to study regulatory interactions during embryonic development. In adults, targeted expression can be used to generate dominant phenotypes for use in genetic screens. We have directed expression of an activated form of the Dras2 protein, resulting in dominant eye and wing defects that can be used in screens to identify other members of the Dras2 signal transduction pathway.",1993,"N Perrimon, A H Brand"

The PLC1 gene was isolated during a study of yeast strains that exhibit defects in chromosome segregation. plc1-1 cells showed a 10-fold increase in aberrant chromosome segregation compared with the wild type. Molecular analysis revealed that PLC1 encodes a predicted protein of 101 kDa with approximately 50 and 26% identity to the highly conserved X and Y domains of PI-PLC isozymes from humans, bovines, rats, and Drosophila melanogaster. The putative yeast protein also contains a consensus EF-hand domain that is predicted to bind calcium.

Regulatory aspects of esterase 6 activity variation in sibling Drosophila species,8360077,10.1038/hdy.1993.105,"Esterase 6 in Drosophila melanogaster, Drosophila simulans and Drosophila mauritiana is produced in several life stages and diverse tissues, but the major pulse of expression is in the sperm ejaculatory duct of adult males. Comparison of EST6 activity levels among several lines of D. melanogaster, D. simulans and D. mauritiana reveals two major quantitative differences among the species. First, newly eclosed females of both D. simulans and D. mauritiana show significantly higher EST6 activity than those of D. melanogaster. Secondly, 5-day-old adult D. simulans have significantly higher activities than D. mauritiana in both sexes and significantly higher activity than D. melanogaster in males. The genetic bases of the differences between D. melanogaster and the other species are investigated through germ line transfer of the D. simulans and D. mauritiana Est-6 genes plus 1.2 kb of 5' and 0.2 kb of their 3' flanking sequences into D. melanogaster. The newly eclosed female activities of the transformants resemble those of the two donor species, suggesting that the interspecific differences in this aspect of expression are due to cis-inherited factors contained within the transferred DNA. In contrast, the 5-day adult activity of the D. simulans transgene resembles the recipient species, D. melanogaster, suggesting that the difference between D. simulans and D. melanogaster in this aspect of expression is due to trans-acting factors. We also find that third instar larval activities of the D. simulans transgene and 5-day male activities of the D. mauritiana transgene are lower than those of either parental species, suggesting that not all the promoter elements relevant to these aspects of expression are included in the transferred DNA.",1993,"J G Oakeshott, J Karotam"

The role of heat-shock proteins in thermotolerance,8098532,10.1098/rstb.1993.0026,"The role of heat-shock proteins (hsps) in thermotolerance was examined in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. In yeast cells, the major protein responsible for thermotolerance is hsp 100. In cells carrying mutations in the hsp 100 gene, HSP 104, growth is normal at both high and low temperatures, but the ability of cells to survive extreme temperatures is severely impaired. The loss of thermotolerance is apparently due to the absence of the hsp 104 protein itself because, with the exception of the hsp 104 protein, no differences in protein profiles were observed between mutant and wild-type cells. Aggregates found in mutant cells at high temperatures suggest that the cause of death may be the accumulation of denatured proteins. No differences in the rates of protein degradation were observed between mutant and wild-type cells. This, and genetic analysis of cells carrying multiple hsp 70 and hsp 104 mutations, suggests that the primary function of hsp 104 is to rescue proteins from denaturation rather than to degrade them once they have been denatured. Drosophila cells do not produce a protein in the hsp 100 class in response to high temperatures. In this organism, hsp 70 appears to be the primary protein involved in thermotolerance. Thus, the relative importance of different hsps in thermotolerance changes from organism to organism.",1993,"S Lindquist, D A Parsell, J Taulien"
Dynamic Hsp83 RNA localization during Drosophila oogenesis and embryogenesis,7684502,10.1128/mcb.13.6.3773,"Hsp83 is the Drosophila homolog of the mammalian Hsp90 family of regulatory molecular chaperones. We show that maternally synthesized Hsp83 transcripts are localized to the posterior pole of the early Drosophila embryo by a novel mechanism involving a combination of generalized RNA degradation and local protection at the posterior. This protection of Hsp83 RNA occurs in wild-type embryos and embryos produced by females carrying the maternal effect mutations nanos and pumilio, which eliminate components of the posterior polar plasm without disrupting polar granule integrity. In contrast, Hsp83 RNA is not protected at the posterior pole of embryos produced by females carrying maternal mutations that disrupt the posterior polar plasm and the polar granules--cappuccino, oskar, spire, staufen, tudor, valois, and vasa. Mislocalization of oskar RNA to the anterior pole, which has been shown to result in induction of germ cells at the anterior, leads to anterior protection of maternal Hsp83 RNA. These results suggest that Hsp83 RNA is a component of the posterior polar plasm that might be associated with polar granules. In addition, we show that zygotic expression of Hsp83 commences in the anterior third of the embryo at the syncytial blastoderm stage and is regulated by the anterior morphogen, bicoid. We consider the possible developmental significance of this complex control of Hsp83 transcript distribution.",1993,"S R Halsell, H D Lipshitz, S M Parkhurst, D Ding"
Effect of vitamin A on longevity,8137896,10.1016/0531-5565(93)90049-j,"Increasing the dietary content of Vitamin A from inadequate to adequate during the developmental stages of Drosophila increased the median life span by as much as 17.5%. The optimum dietary range of concentrations of Vitamin A for increasing the life span of Drosophila was found to be between 4 and 8 IU/g food. The maximum life span was reduced as dietary concentrations of Vitamin A exceeded this value. Vitamin A palmitate and retinal inhibited the peroxidation of linolenic acid induced by the generation of superoxide radicals from acetaldehyde. Other forms of Vitamin A, such as retinol and retinoic acid, moderately inhibited lipid peroxidation at low concentrations but stimulated peroxidation considerably when present at high concentrations. Based upon the ability of these retinoids to inhibit the reduction of cytochrome c by superoxide radicals, we propose that retinoids can inhibit and stimulate lipid peroxidation depending upon their concentration by reacting with superoxide radicals. We suggest that this reaction is the basis for the apparent ability of Vitamin A to prolong and shorten life span depending upon the dietary intake.",1993,"M B Baird, J L Hough, H R Massie, T R Williams, V R Aiello"

"The effect of the inactive mutation on longevity, sex, rhythm and resistance to p-cresol in Drosophila melanogaster",8496068,10.1038/hdy.1993.55,"Flies carrying the inactive (iav) mutation exhibit low locomotor activity and poor mating success, both of which are associated with a deficiency in the putative neurotransmitter, octopamine. Several other aspects of the iav mutant phenotype are described here. Male and female iav mutants show a small reduction in longevity but it is not clear whether this is a consequence of the iav mutation or their inactive phenotype. Young iav males show extended attractiveness to older courting males, which supports the notion that the iav gene has a role in post-eclosional maturation. The eclosion rhythm of iav mutants is normal, discounting the possibility of a role for octopamine in the maintenance of circadian rhythm. Flies carrying the iav mutation are highly susceptible to the octopamine analogue p-Cresol. Other phenotypically inactive flies show wild type levels of p-Cresol resistance. This is attributed to the deficiency of octopamine in iav mutants because low octopamine levels may be unable to out-compete the toxic effect of p-Cresol. Some inferences on the possible mode of action of the iav gene product are discussed.",1993,K M O'Dell

"Comparing mutants, selective breeding, and transgenics in the dissection of aging processes of Caenorhabditis elegans",8125279,10.1007/BF01435988,"The genetic analysis of aging processes has matured in the last ten years with reports that long-lived strains of both fruit flies and nematodes have been developed. Several attempts to identify mutants in the fruit fly with increased longevity have failed and the reasons for these failures are analyzed. A major problem in obligate sexual species, such as the fruit fly, is the presence of inbreeding depression that makes the analysis of life-history traits in homozygotes very difficult. Nevertheless, several successful genetic analyses of aging in Drosophila suggest that with careful design, fruitful analysis of induced mutants affecting life span is possible. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, mutations in the age-1 gene result in a life extension of some 70%; thus age-1 clearly specifies a process involved in organismic senescence. This gene maps to chromosome II, well separated from a locus (fer-15) which is responsible for a large fertility deficit in the original stocks. There is no trade-off between either rate of development or fertility versus life span associated with the age-1 mutation. Transgenic analyses confirm that the fertility deficit can be corrected by a wild-type fer-15 transformant (transgene); however, the life span of these transformed stocks is affected by the transgenic array in an unpredictable fashion. The molecular nature of the age-1 gene remains unknown and we continue in our efforts to clone the gene.",1993,"T E Johnson, G J Lithgow, P M Tedesco"

The effect of genetic phone on DTS lethal penetrance and expressivity was studied. The character of expression of two mutations possessing a pleiotropic action was examined. The heat-sensitive 1(2)M90DTS mutation disturbed the structure of abdominal tergites in all imago and, besides, caused an abrupt decrease in the female reproductive period. The pattern of alterations observed in oogenesis along with the result of phenogenetic analysis suggest that this gene takes part in the genetic control over the proliferation of stem oogonial cells. The cold-sensitive 1(2)M66DCS mutation caused a number of disturbances in imago thoracic structures: inability to flight, raised up wings, extremity fracture, etc. Mutant flies showed serious disorders of indirect flight muscles both at morphological and at ultrastructural levels.

For this reason, the generation of germ-line transformants has relied on the utilization of transposable elements to effect the chromosomal integration of injected DNA (1,2). The success of this approach has depended largely on our understanding of the biology of P elements and the syncitial nature of the early Drosophila embryo. The first 13 embryonic divisions following fertilization are nuclear, resulting in the formation of a syncitium. Consequently, if microinjection into the posterior end of the embryo is carried out prior to cellularization, a proportion of the microinjected DNA will be present in the cytoplasm of the pole cells, the progenitor cells of the germ line.",1993,"M O'Connor, W Chia"
A Drosophila gene encoding an epithelial membrane protein with homology to CD36/LIMP II,7693949,10.1006/jmbi.1993.1580,"The human cell surface transmembrane protein CD36 has important roles in cell adhesion and signal transduction. There is a related rat protein, LIMP II (also known as rLGP85), which is a well-characterized lysosomal membrane protein.

We have identified a new member of this family, encoded by a Drosophila gene called emp (epithelial membrane protein). The emp protein, as predicted from the nucleotide sequence, is 519 amino acid residues long. It shows striking similarity throughout most of its sequence to both CD36 and LIMP II. Drosophila emp transcripts are expressed during embryogenesis in various epithelial cell types derived from the ectoderm. During larval development, we detect emp transcripts in the epithelial cells of wing imaginal discs, in the precursor cells for adult epidermal structures.

Here we describe the characterization of one of these new Drosophila homeobox genes, called brain-specific-homeobox (bsh). In embryos, bsh is expressed exclusively in the brain. bsh protein accumulates in approximately 30 cells in each brain hemisphere. One of these bsh expressing cells is closely associated with the terminus of the larval visual nerve (Bolwig's nerve). While deletions of chromosomal interval containing the bsh gene show no dramatic changes in embryonic brain morphology, the expression pattern of the bsh gene suggests that it may play a highly specialized role in the determination and function of cell type in the Drosophila brain.",1993,"W McGinnis, B Jones"
"NRF-1, an activator involved in nuclear-mitochondrial interactions, utilizes a new DNA-binding domain conserved in a family of developmental regulators",8253388,10.1101/gad.7.12a.2431,"Nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF-1) was first discovered as an activator of the cytochrome c gene and was subsequently found to play a broader role in nuclear-mitochondrial interactions. We have now cloned a HeLa cDNA encoding NRF-1 using degenerate oligomers derived from tryptic peptide sequences for PCR amplification. The cDNA-encoded protein was indistinguishable from the authentic HeLa cell factor on denaturing gels, displayed the expected NRF-1 DNA-binding specificity, and made the same guanine nucleotide contacts as HeLa NRF-1 on binding known NRF-1 recognition sites. Antiserum raised against the highly purified recombinant protein recognized the identical DNA-protein complex formed using either a crude nuclear fraction or nearly homogeneous HeLa NRF-1. Recombinant NRF-1 also activated transcription through specific sites from several NRF-1-responsive promoters, confirming both the transcriptional activity and specificity of the cDNA product. Portions of NRF-1 are closely related to sea urchin P3A2 and the erect wing (EWG) protein of Drosophila. Both are recently identified developmental regulatory factors. The region of highest sequence identity with P3A2 and EWG was in the amino-terminal half of the molecule, which was found by deletion mapping to contain the DNA-binding domain, whereas the carboxy-terminal half of NRF-1 was highly divergent from both proteins. The DNA-binding domain in these molecules is unrelated to motifs found commonly in DNA-binding proteins; thus, NRF-1, P3A2, and EWG represent the founding members of a new class of highly conserved sequence-specific regulatory factors.",1993,"C A Virbasius, J V Virbasius, R C Scarpulla"
[Mutagenic effect of pindone on D. melanogaster],8129904,,A commercial grade Pindone was tested for the induction of genetic damage in male germ cells of Drosophila melanogaster by adult ingestion.

AU-rich intronic elements affect pre-mRNA 5' splice site selection in Drosophila melanogaster,8246985,10.1128/mcb.13.12.7689,"cis-spliced nuclear pre-mRNA introns found in a variety of organisms, including Tetrahymena thermophila, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, and plants, are significantly richer in adenosine and uridine residues than their flanking exons are. The functional significance of this intronic AU richness, however, has been demonstrated only in plant nuclei. In these nuclei, 5' and 3' splice sites are selected in part by their positions relative to AU-rich elements spread throughout the length of an intron. Because of this position-dependent selection scheme, a 5' splice site at the normal (+1) exon-intron boundary having only three contiguous consensus nucleotides can compete effectively with an enhanced exonic site (-57E) having nine consensus nucleotides and outcompete an enhanced site (+106E) embedded within the AU-rich intron. To determine whether transitions from AU-poor exonic sequences to AU-rich intronic sequences influence 5' splice site selection in other organisms, alleles of the pea rbcS3A1 intron were expressed in Drosophila Schneider 2 cells, and their splicing patterns were compared with those in tobacco nuclei. We demonstrate that this heterologous transcript can be accurately spliced in transfected Drosophila nuclei and that a +1 G-to-A knockout mutation at the normal splice site activates the same three cryptic 5' splice sites as in tobacco. Enhancement of the exonic (-57) and intronic (+106) sites to consensus splice sites indicates that potential splice sites located in the upstream exon or at the 5' exon-intron boundary are preferred in Drosophila cells over those embedded within AU-rich intronic sequences. In contrast to tobacco, in which the activities of two competing 5' splice sites upstream of the AU-rich intron are modulated by their proximity to the AU transition point, D. melanogaster utilizes the upstream site which has a higher proportion of consensus nucleotides. The enhanced version of the cryptic intronic site is efficiently selected in D. melanogaster when the normal +1 site is weakened or discrete AU-rich elements upstream of the +106E site are disrupted. Selection of this internal site in tobacco requires more drastic disruption of these motifs. We conclude that 5' splice site selection in Drosophila nuclei is influenced by the intrinsic strengths of competing sites and by the presence of AU-rich intronic elements but to a different extent than in tobacco.",1993,"M A Schuler, A J McCullough"
Selective neuroanatomical plasticity and division of labour in the honeybee,8321320,10.1038/364238a0,"The mushroom bodies in the protocerebrum are believed to be the structures of the insect brain most closely associated with higher-order sensory integration and learning. Drosophila melanogaster mutants with olfactory learning deficits have anatomically abnormal mushroom bodies or altered patterns of gene expression in mushroom body neurons. In addition, anatomical reorganization of the mushroom bodies occurs in adult flies, and possibly in adult honeybees; disturbance of electrical activity in this region disrupts memory formation in honeybees. Little is known, however, about the relationship of naturally occurring anatomical changes in the mushroom bodies to naturally occurring behavioural plasticity. We now report that age-based division of labour in adult worker honeybees (Apis mellifera) is associated with substantial changes in certain brain regions, notably the mushroom bodies. Moreover, these striking changes in brain structure are dependent, not on the age of the bee, but on its foraging experience, thus demonstrating a robust anatomical plasticity associated with complex behaviour in an adult insect.",1993,"G S Withers, S E Fahrbach, G E Robinson"
The Ecdysone receptor constrains wingless expression to pattern cell cycle across the Drosophila wing margin in a Cyclin B-dependent manner,23848468,10.1186/1471-213X-13-28,"Background: Ecdysone triggers transcriptional changes via the ecdysone receptor (EcR) to coordinate developmental programs of apoptosis, cell cycle and differentiation. Data suggests EcR affects cell cycle gene expression indirectly and here we identify Wingless as an intermediary factor linking EcR to cell cycle. Results: We demonstrate EcR patterns cell cycle across the presumptive Drosophila wing margin by constraining wg transcription to modulate CycB expression, but not the previously identified Wg-targets dMyc or Stg. Furthermore co-knockdown of Wg restores CycB patterning in EcR knockdown clones. Wg is not a direct target of EcR, rather we demonstrate that repression of Wg by EcR is likely mediated by direct interaction between the EcR-responsive zinc finger transcription factor Crol and the wg promoter. Conclusions: Thus we elucidate a critical mechanism potentially connecting ecdysone with patterning signals to ensure correct timing of cell cycle exit and differentiation during margin wing development.",2013,"Leonie M Quinn, Jane I Lin, Amanda Lee, Olga Zaytseva, Nicola Cranna, Naomi C Mitchell"
Assessing the role of cell-surface molecules in central synaptogenesis in the Drosophila visual system,24386266,10.1371/journal.pone.0083732,"A hallmark of the central nervous system is its spatial and functional organization in synaptic layers. During neuronal development, axons form transient contacts with potential post-synaptic elements and establish synapses with appropriate partners at specific layers. These processes are regulated by synaptic cell-adhesion molecules. In the Drosophila visual system, R7 and R8 photoreceptor subtypes target distinct layers and form en passant pre-synaptic terminals at stereotypic loci of the axonal shaft. A leucine-rich repeat transmembrane protein, Capricious (Caps), is known to be selectively expressed in R8 axons and their recipient layer, which led to the attractive hypothesis that Caps mediates R8 synaptic specificity by homophilic adhesion. Contradicting this assumption, our results indicate that Caps does not have a prominent role in synaptic-layer targeting and synapse formation in Drosophila photoreceptors, and that the specific recognition of the R8 target layer does not involve Caps homophilic axon-target interactions. We generated flies that express a tagged synaptic marker to evaluate the presence and localization of synapses in R7 and R8 photoreceptors. These genetic tools were used to assess how the synaptic profile is affected when axons are forced to target abnormal layers by expressing axon guidance molecules. When R7 axons were mistargeted to the R8-recipient layer, R7s either maintained an R7-like synaptic profile or acquired a similar profile to r8s depending on the overexpressed protein. When R7 axons were redirected to a more superficial medulla layer, the number of presynaptic terminals was reduced. These results indicate that cell-surface molecules are able to dictate synapse loci by changing the axon terminal identity in a partially cell-autonomous manner, but that presynapse formation at specific sites also requires complex interactions between pre- and post-synaptic elements.",2013,"Gaia Tavosanis, Sandra Berger-Müller, Satoko Hakeda-Suzuki, Fumio Takahashi, Atsushi Sugie, Takashi Suzuki"
Whole-Genome rVISTA: a tool to determine enrichment of transcription factor binding sites in gene promoters from transcriptomic data,23736530,10.1093/bioinformatics/btt318,"Summary: We have developed a web-based query tool, Whole-Genome rVISTA (WGRV), that determines enrichment of transcription factors (TFs) and associated target genes in sets of co-regulated genes. WGRV enables users to query databases containing pre-computed genome coordinates of evolutionarily conserved transcription factor binding sites in the proximal promoters (from 100 bp to 5 kb upstream) of human, mouse and Drosophila genomes. TF binding sites are based on position-weight matrices from the TRANSFAC Professional database. For a given set of co-regulated genes, WGRV returns statistically enriched and evolutionarily conserved binding sites, mapped by the regulatory VISTA (rVISTA) algorithm. Users can then retrieve a list of genes from the query set containing the enriched TF binding sites and their location in the query set promoters. Results are exported in a BED format for rapid visualization in the UCSC genome browser. Flat files of mapped conserved sites and their genomic coordinates are also available for analysis with stand-alone software.

A population genetic model for the maintenance of R2 retrotransposons in rRNA gene loci,23326244,10.1371/journal.pgen.1003179,"R2 retrotransposable elements exclusively insert into the tandemly repeated rRNA genes, the rDNA loci, of their animal hosts. R2 elements form stable long-term associations with their host, in which all individuals in a population contain many potentially active copies, but only a fraction of these individuals show active R2 retrotransposition. Previous studies have found that R2 RNA transcripts are processed from a 28S co-transcript and that the likelihood of R2-inserted units being transcribed is dependent upon their distribution within the rDNA locus. Here we analyze the rDNA locus and R2 elements from nearly 100 R2-active and R2-inactive individuals from natural populations of Drosophila simulans. Along with previous findings concerning the structure and expression of the rDNA loci, these data were incorporated into computer simulations to model the crossover events that give rise to the concerted evolution of the rRNA genes. The simulations that best reproduce the population data assume that only about 40 rDNA units out of the over 200 total units are actively transcribed and that these transcribed units are clustered in a single region of the locus. In the model, the host establishes this transcription domain at each generation in the region with the fewest R2 insertions. Only if the host cannot avoid R2 insertions within this 40-unit domain are R2 elements active in that generation. The simulations also require that most crossover events in the locus occur in the transcription domain in order to explain the empirical observation that R2 elements are seldom duplicated by crossover events. Thus the key to the long-term stability of R2 elements is the stochastic nature of the crossover events within the rDNA locus, and the inevitable expansions and contractions that introduce and remove R2-inserted units from the transcriptionally active domain.",2013,"Thomas H Eickbush, Michael T Eickbush, Jun Zhou"

Genome-wide identification of chromatin transitional regions reveals diverse mechanisms defining the boundary of facultative heterochromatin,23840609,10.1371/journal.pone.0067156,"Due to the self-propagating nature of the heterochromatic modification H3K27me3, chromatin barrier activities are required to demarcate the boundary and prevent it from encroaching into euchromatic regions. Studies in Drosophila and vertebrate systems have revealed several important chromatin barrier elements and their respective binding factors. However, epigenomic data indicate that the binding of these factors are not exclusive to chromatin boundaries. To gain a comprehensive understanding of facultative heterochromatin boundaries, we developed a two-tiered method to identify the Chromatin Transitional Region (CTR), i.e. the nucleosomal region that shows the greatest transition rate of the H3K27me3 modification as revealed by ChIP-Seq. This approach was applied to identify CTRs in Drosophila S2 cells and human HeLa cells. Although many insulator proteins have been characterized in Drosophila, less than half of the CTRs in S2 cells are associated with known insulator proteins, indicating unknown mechanisms remain to be characterized. Our analysis also revealed that the peak binding of insulator proteins are usually 1-2 nucleosomes away from the CTR. Comparison of CTR-associated insulator protein binding sites vs. those in heterochromatic region revealed that boundary-associated binding sites are distinctively flanked by nucleosome destabilizing sequences, which correlates with significant decreased nucleosome density and increased binding intensities of co-factors. Interestingly, several subgroups of boundaries have enhanced H3.3 incorporation but reduced nucleosome turnover rate. Our genome-wide study reveals that diverse mechanisms are employed to define the boundaries of facultative heterochromatin. In both Drosophila and mammalian systems, only a small fraction of insulator protein binding sites co-localize with H3K27me3 boundaries. However, boundary-associated insulator binding sites are distinctively flanked by nucleosome destabilizing sequences, which correlates with significantly decreased nucleosome density and increased binding of co-factors.",2013,"Guangyao Li, Lei Zhou"
Evolutionary adaptation of the fly Pygo PHD finger toward recognizing histone H3 tail methylated at arginine 2,24183574,10.1016/j.str.2013.09.013,"Pygo proteins promote Armadillo- and β-catenin-dependent transcription, by relieving Groucho-dependent repression of Wnt targets.

Intriguingly, fly Pygo orthologs exhibit a tryptophan > phenylalanine substitution in their histone pocket-divider which reduces their affinity for histones. Here, we use X-ray crystallography and NMR, to discover a conspicuous groove bordering this phenylalanine in the Drosophila PHD-HD1 complex--a semi-aromatic cage recognizing asymmetrically methylated arginine 2 (R2me2a), a chromatin mark of silenced genes. Our structural model of the ternary complex reveals a distinct mode of dimethylarginine recognition, involving a polar interaction between R2me2a and its groove, the structural integrity of which is crucial for normal tissue patterning.

RecQ5 protein translocation into the nucleus by a nuclear localization signal,23811565,10.1248/bpb.b13-00136,"RecQ5, a member of the RecQ helicase family, maintains genome stability via participation in many DNA metabolic processes including DNA repair, DNA resolution, and RNA transcription, processes occurring in the nucleus. Previously, we reported that RecQ5 and Rad51, also involved in DNA repair, become co-localized in nuclei when co-expressed in cultured cells. Nuclear localization of RecQ5 appears to be important for cellular function along with Rad51. However, little is known about the nuclear localization of RecQ5. Here, we generated enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-tagged RecQ5 transgenic flies and analyzed localization of this protein in early embryos by live imaging. In syncytial embryos, RecQ5 was localized synchronously in interphase nuclei, and spread repeatedly over the embryos in mitosis. Thus, RecQ5 was transported into nuclei at the early interphase. Furthermore, we examined the subcellular localization of a series of truncated forms of Drosophila RecQ5 in cultured cells to determine the nuclear localization signal (NLS). Entire coding or deleted RecQ5 sequences of various sizes were ligated into EGFP vectors, which were then used to transfect cultured Drosophila cells. The region responsible for nuclear localization of Drosophila RecQ5 contained a short stretch of positively charged basic amino acids, 2 of which were particularly important for the nuclear localization. This stretch was sufficient for nuclear localization when fused with EGFP. Although the NLS of Drosophila RecQ5 was distinct from that of human RECQL5 in terms of position and amino acid sequence, this fly RecQ5 protein was translocated into the nucleus by an NLS.",2013,"Katsumi Kawasaki, Takahiro Higashi, Fumiaki Ito, Rika Azuma, Haruna Sakurai, Ayaka Tsutsui"
Distribution and morphological changes of the Golgi apparatus during Drosophila spermatogenesis,23855356,10.1111/dgd.12070,"In spermatogenesis, the Golgi apparatus is important for the formation of the acrosome, which is a sperm-specific organelle essential for fertilization. Comprehensive examinations of the spatiotemporal distribution and morphological characterizations of the Golgi in various cells during spermatogenesis are necessary for functional analyses and mutant screenings in the model eukaryote Drosophila. Here, we examined the distribution and morphology of the Golgi during Drosophila spermatogenesis with immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. In pre-meiotic germ cells, the Golgi apparatuses were distributed evenly in the cytoplasm. In contrast, they were located exclusively in two regions near the poles during the meiotic metaphase, where they were segregated prior to the chromosomes. In cells in anaphase to telophase, the Golgi were predominantly left behind in the equatorial region between the separating daughter nuclei. After completion of meiosis, the dispersed Golgi were assembled at the apical side of the spermatid nucleus to form the acrosome. Further investigation of the Golgi distribution in β2-tubulin mutants showed aberrant and uneven distributions of the Golgi among sister cells in the meiotic spermatocytes and in the post-meiotic spermatids. At the ultrastructural level, the Golgi apparatus in pre-meiotic spermatocytes comprised a pair of stacks. The two stacks were situated adjacent to each other, as if they had duplicated before entering into meiotic division. These results highlight the dynamic nature of the Golgi during spermatogenesis and provide a framework for analyzing the correlations between the dynamics of the Golgi and its function in sperm development.",2013,"Jun-ichi Kawano, Yusaku Yasuno, Masa-Toshi Yamamoto, Yoshihiro H Inoue"
Hedgehog is required for CySC self-renewal but does not contribute to the GSC niche in the Drosophila testis,23175633,10.1242/dev.086413,"The Drosophila testis harbors two types of stem cells: germ line stem cells (GSCs) and cyst stem cells (CySCs). Both stem cell types share a physical niche called the hub, located at the apical tip of the testis. The niche produces the JAK/STAT ligand Unpaired (Upd) and BMPs to maintain CySCs and GSCs, respectively. However, GSCs also require BMPs produced by CySCs, and as such CySCs are part of the niche for GSCs. Here we describe a role for another secreted ligand, Hedgehog (Hh), produced by niche cells, in the self-renewal of CySCs. Hh signaling cell-autonomously regulates CySC number and maintenance. The Hh and JAK/STAT pathways act independently and non-redundantly in CySC self-renewal. Finally, Hh signaling does not contribute to the niche function of CySCs, as Hh-sustained CySCs are unable to maintain GSCs in the absence of Stat92E. Therefore, the extended niche function of CySCs is solely attributable to JAK/STAT pathway function.",2013,"Michael Burel, Justina Sanny, Erika A Bach, Marc Amoyel"
midlife crisis encodes a conserved zinc-finger protein required to maintain neuronal differentiation in Drosophila,24026126,10.1242/dev.093781,"Stem cells generate progeny that undergo terminal differentiation. The initiation and maintenance of the differentiated status is crucial for tissue development, function and homeostasis. Drosophila neural stem cells (neuroblasts) are a model for stem cell self-renewal and differentiation; they divide asymmetrically to self-renew and generate the neurons and glia of the CNS. Here we report the identification of midlife crisis (mdlc; CG4973) as a gene required for the maintenance of neuronal differentiation and for neuroblast proliferation in Drosophila. mdlc encodes a ubiquitously expressed zinc-finger-containing protein with conserved orthologs from yeast to humans that are reported to have a role in RNA splicing. Using clonal analysis, we demonstrate that mdlc mutant neurons initiate but fail to complete differentiation, as judged by the loss of the pro-differentiation transcription factor Prospero, followed by derepression of the neuroblast factors Deadpan, Asense and Cyclin E. RNA-seq shows that loss of Mdlc decreases pros transcript levels and results in aberrant pros splicing. Importantly, misexpression of the full-length human ortholog, RNF113A, completely rescues all CNS defects in mdlc mutants. We conclude that Mdlc plays an essential role in maintaining neuronal differentiation, raising the possibility that RNF113A regulates neuronal differentiation in the human CNS.",2013,"Adam J Struck, Chris Q Doe, Travis D Carney"
The ETS domain transcriptional repressor Anterior open inhibits MAP kinase and Wingless signaling to couple tracheal cell fate with branch identity,23444354,10.1242/dev.087874,"Cells at the tips of budding branches in the Drosophila tracheal system generate two morphologically different types of seamless tubes. Terminal cells (TCs) form branched lumenized extensions that mediate gas exchange at target tissues, whereas fusion cells (FCs) form ring-like connections between adjacent tracheal metameres. Each tracheal branch contains a specific set of TCs, FCs, or both, but the mechanisms that select between the two tip cell types in a branch-specific fashion are not clear. Here, we show that the ETS domain transcriptional repressor anterior open (aop) is dispensable for directed tracheal cell migration, but plays a key role in tracheal tip cell fate specification. Whereas aop globally inhibits TC and FC specification, MAPK signaling overcomes this inhibition by triggering degradation of Aop in tip cells. Loss of aop function causes excessive FC and TC specification, indicating that without Aop-mediated inhibition, all tracheal cells are competent to adopt a specialized fate. We demonstrate that Aop plays a dual role by inhibiting both MAPK and Wingless signaling, which induce TC and FC fate, respectively. In addition, the branch-specific choice between the two seamless tube types depends on the tracheal branch identity gene spalt major, which is sufficient to inhibit TC specification. Thus, a single repressor, Aop, integrates two different signals to couple tip cell fate selection with branch identity. The switch from a branching towards an anastomosing tip cell type may have evolved with the acquisition of a main tube that connects separate tracheal primordia to generate a tubular network.",2013,"Sara Caviglia, Stefan Luschnig"
Noncoding RNAs of the Ultrabithorax domain of the Drosophila bithorax complex,24077301,10.1534/genetics.113.155036,"RNA transcripts without obvious coding potential are widespread in many creatures, including the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster.

It has been suggested that these noncoding RNAs have a role in establishing active domains, perhaps by setting the state of Polycomb Response Elements A comprehensive survey across the proximal half of the bithorax complex has now revealed nine distinct noncoding RNA transcripts, including four within the Ultrabithorax transcription unit. At the blastoderm stage, the noncoding transcripts collectively span ∼75% of the 135 kb surveyed.

Localization of FtsZ in Helicobacter pylori and consequences for cell division,23335414,10.1128/JB.01490-12,"Of the various kinds of cell division, the most common mode is binary fission, the division of a cell into two morphologically identical daughter cells. However, in the case of asymmetric cell division, Caulobacter crescentus produces two morphologically and functionally distinct cell types. Here, we have studied cell cycle progression of the human pathogen Helicobacter pylori using a functional green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion of FtsZ protein and membrane staining. In small cells, representing newly divided cells, FtsZ localizes to a single cell pole. During the cell cycle, spiral intermediates are formed until an FtsZ ring is positioned with very little precision, such that central as well as acentral rings can be observed. Daughter cells showed considerably different sizes, suggesting that H. pylori divides asymmetrically. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) analyses demonstrate that the H. pylori FtsZ ring is about as dynamic as that of Escherichia coli but that polar assemblies show less turnover. Strikingly, our results demonstrate that H. pylori cell division follows a different route from that in E. coli and Bacillus subtilis. It is also different from that in C. crescentus, where cytokinesis regulation proteins like MipZ play a role. Therefore, this report provides the first cell-biological analysis of FtsZ dynamics in the human pathogen H. pylori and even in epsilonproteobacteria to our knowledge.

A dynamic deep sleep stage in Drosophila,23595750,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0061-13.2013,"How might one determine whether simple animals such as flies sleep in stages? Sleep in mammals is a dynamic process involving different stages of sleep intensity, and these are typically associated with measurable changes in brain activity (Blake and Gerard, 1937; Rechtschaffen and Kales, 1968; Webb and Agnew, 1971). Evidence for different sleep stages in invertebrates remains elusive, even though it has been well established that many invertebrate species require sleep (Campbell and Tobler, 1984; Hendricks et al., 2000; Shaw et al., 2000; Sauer et al., 2003). Here we used electrophysiology and arousal-testing paradigms to show that the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, transitions between deeper and lighter sleep within extended bouts of inactivity, with deeper sleep intensities after ∼15 and ∼30 min of inactivity. As in mammals, the timing and intensity of these dynamic sleep processes in flies is homeostatically regulated and modulated by behavioral experience. Two molecules linked to synaptic plasticity regulate the intensity of the first deep sleep stage. Optogenetic upregulation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate during the day increases sleep intensity at night, whereas loss of function of a molecule involved in synaptic pruning, the fragile-X mental retardation protein, increases sleep intensity during the day. Our results show that sleep is not homogenous in insects, and suggest that waking behavior and the associated synaptic plasticity mechanisms determine the timing and intensity of deep sleep stages in Drosophila.",2013,"Bart van Alphen, Bruno van Swinderen, Leonie Kirszenblat, Benjamin Kottler, Melvyn H W Yap"
Insights into differential activity patterns of drosophilids under semi-natural conditions,24143027,10.1242/jeb.092270,"We showed recently that Drosophila ananassae, a closely related and sympatric species of the commonly studied fruitfly D. melanogaster, shows distinctly deviant patterns in circadian activity/rest rhythm from the latter under a variety of laboratory conditions. To examine whether such differences extend to more natural conditions where a variety of time cues and similar environmental pressures might force different species to adopt similar temporal patterns, we examined these two species under semi-natural conditions over a span of 1.5 years. Furthermore, we asked to what extent features of activity/rest rhythm of flies are conserved across species under changing environmental conditions encountered across seasons, and to do so, we studied two more drosophilid species. We found that while each species exhibits seasonality in activity patterns, this seasonality is marked by interesting inter-specific differences. Similar to laboratory studies, D. ananassae showed activity mostly during the day, while D. melanogaster and D. malerkotliana exhibited almost similar activity patterns across seasons, with predominantly two peaks of activity, one in the morning and another in the evening. Throughout the year, Zaprionus indianus displayed very low levels of activity compared with D. melanogaster, yet, compared with those seen in standard laboratory assays, this species exhibited more robust rhythms under semi-natural conditions.

For rapid and economical identification of novel, bioavailable anti-tumour chemicals, the use of appropriate in vivo tumour models suitable for large-scale screening is key.

We then develop an in vivo 96-well plate chemical screening platform to carry out large-scale chemical screening with the tumour model. In a proof-of-principle pilot screen of 2000 compounds, we identify the glutamine analogue, acivicin, a chemical with known activity against human tumour cells, as a potent and specific inhibitor of Drosophila tumour formation. RNAi-mediated knockdown of candidate acivicin target genes implicates an enzyme involved in pyrimidine biosynthesis, CTP synthase, as a possible crucial target of acivicin-mediated inhibition.

A yeast artificial chromosome containing the mouse homeobox cluster Hox-2,1972280,10.1073/pnas.87.12.4751,"We have isolated two genes, Hox-2.8 and Hox-2.9, from the mouse homeobox cluster Hox-2, located on chromosome 11. A 120-kilobase yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) containing a large region of the murine Hox-2 cluster, including 45 kilobases of sequence upstream of the most 5' gene, was cloned. The DNA sequence of the YAC is unrearranged relative to the genomic map. We have subcloned from the YAC insert a homeobox gene, Hox-2.8, whose homeodolmain is highly related to that of the Drosophila homeotic gene proboscopedia (pb). The expression pattern of Hox-2.8 during embryogenesis extends the trend established by genes from Hox-2.5 to -2.7 of successively anterior domains of expression in the neural tube. We have also subcloned and sequenced from a cosmid the labial (lab)-related Hox-2.9, the most 3' member of the cluster to date. These data lend further support to the idea of a common evolutionary origin of the mouse Hox and Drosophila HOM clusters. The YAC will enable us to construct modified forms of the Hox-2 cluster in yeast and to identify their effect on the phenotype of the animal in transgenic mouse strains.",1990,"Z Larin, H Lehrach, N Papalopulu, M Cook, M J Rubock, R Krumlauf"
"""Sex ratio"" meiotic drive in Drosophila testacea",2249763,,"We document the occurrence of ""sex ratio"" meiotic drive in natural populations of Drosophila testacea. ""Sex ratio"" males sire greater than 95% female offspring. Genetic analysis reveals that this effect is due to a meiotically driven X chromosome, as in other species of Drosophila in which ""sex ratio"" has been found. In contrast to other drosophilids, the ""sex ratio"" and standard chromosomes of D. testacea do not differ in gene arrangement, implying that the effect may be due to a single genetic factor in this species. In all likelihood, the ""sex ratio"" condition has evolved independently in D. testacea and in the Drosophila obscura species group, as the loci responsible for the effect occur on different chromosomal elements. An important ecological consequence of ""sex ratio"" is that natural populations of D. testacea exhibit a strong female bias. Because D. testacea mates, oviposits, and feeds as adults and larvae on mushrooms, this species provides an excellent opportunity to study the selective factors in nature that prevent ""sex ratio"" chromosomes from increasing to fixation and causing the extinction of the species.",1990,"J Jaenike, A C James"
Transcriptional analyses of the uncoordinated region of Drosophila melanogaster,1707845,10.1139/g90-125,"RNA blotting experiments reveal that a genomic region encompassing the uncoordinated complementation group of Drosophila melanogaster produces two classes of transcripts. The first class contains five polyadenylated RNAs, of 4.35, 8.7, 9.0, 11.5, and 13.0 kb, and the second class contains a transcript of 7.3 kb that can be detected in both the total cellular and the poly(A)+ fractions. Transcripts of the first class are found predominantly in the early larval, pupal, and adult life stages, whereas the 7.3-kb species is present throughout the life cycle and is also found in the heads of adult flies. The two classes of RNAs derive from different combinations of exons. Analyses of RNAs derived from genotypes that are deficient for the uncoordinated complementation group and from seven uncoordinated mutant alleles support the suggestion that the uncoordinated gene (unc) has been isolated and encodes the multiple transcripts.",1990,"R J Russell, M J Healy"
[Expressivity of the gene-enzymatic system and viability indicators in the ontogenesis of Drosophila inbred lines and hybrids],2126521,,"The activity, physico-chemical properties and multiple molecular forms of enzymes (alcohol dehydrogenase, superoxide dismutase, nonspecific alpha- and beta-esterases, hydroxide peptidohydrolase) were studied in ontogenesis of Drosophila inbred lines and their hybrids under conditions of high temperature (37-41 degrees C) and the presence in food of 10% ethanol. It was established that resistance of individuals to the effect of high temperature and alcohol, including manifestation of adaptive heterosis in hybrids not always depends on the level of the activity of enzymes analysed and is rather determined by allelic state of the appropriate structural genes. So, in conditions of the alcohol stress the individuals containing highly active F form of alcohol dehydrogenase have selective advantage and flie with hybrid F/S enzyme of higher activity and heat stability are more stable to the effect of high temperature. It is supposed that the complexes of adaptation genes (CGA) are formed in individuals of populations in response to the regular action of unfavourable environmental factors. These complexes condition optimal allelic control and most efficient regulation of enzyme activity in environment. Genotypic adaptation of individuals as well as occurrence of adaptive heterosis in hybrids seem likely to be connected with formation of CGA.",1990,"V N Totskiĭ, G I Belova, A M Andrievskiĭ, N G Gandiruk, N D Khaustova, E V Eserkepova"
Molecular characteristics of the heterochromatic I elements from a reactive strain of Drosophila melanogaster,2175814,10.1007/BF02106056,"There are two categories of strains in Drosophila melanogaster with respect to the I-R system of hybrid dysgenesis. The inducer strains contain particular transposable elements named I factors. They are not present in the strains of the other category called reactive (R) strains. Defective I elements are present in the pericentromeric regions of both categories of strains. This last subfamily of I sequences has not yet been described in detail and little is known about its origin. In this paper, we report that the defective I elements display an average of 94% of sequence identity with each other and with the transposable I factor. The results suggest that they cannot be the progenitors of the present day I factors, but that each of these two subfamilies started to evolve independently several million years ago. Furthermore, the sequence comparison of these I elements with an active I factor from Drosophila teissieri provides useful information about when the deleted I elements became immobilized.",1990,"P Abad, A Pelisson, C Vaury, A Bucheton, A Lenoir"
Sex-linked dosage-sensitive modifiers as imprinting genes,2151032,,"It is proposed that differential genome imprinting is the result of dosage-sensitive modifier genes located on the sex chromosomes. Parallels between variegating position-effects in Drosophila, the phenotype elicited by transgenes in the mouse and data from several pediatric tumors indicate that the net result of the activity of such modifier genes is often cellular mosaicism in the expression of affected alleles. The mechanism by which inactivation of affected alleles is achieved is proposed to be through the formation of heterochromatic domains. Because the relevant sex-linked modifying loci are dosage sensitive in their activity, differential imprinting will occur even within homogeneous genetic backgrounds. The presence of allelic variants at these loci in non-inbred populations will give rise to variation in the observed expressivity and mode of inheritance of affected traits.",1990,C Sapienza
"The trypanosome leucine repeat gene in the variant surface glycoprotein expression site encodes a putative metal-binding domain and a region resembling protein-binding domains of yeast, Drosophila, and mammalian proteins",2247064,10.1128/mcb.10.12.6436,"We have identified a new variant surface glycoprotein expression site-associated gene (ESAG) in Trypanosoma brucei, the trypanosome leucine repeat (T-LR) gene. Like most other ESAGs, it is expressed in a life cycle stage-specific manner. The N-terminal 20% of the predicted T-LR protein resembles the metal-binding domains of nucleic acid-binding proteins. The remainder is composed of leucine-rich repeats that are characteristic of protein-binding domains found in a variety of other eucaryote proteins. This is the first report of leucine-rich repeats and potential nucleic acid-binding domains on the same protein. The T-LR gene is adjacent to ESAG 4, which has homology to the catalytic domain of adenylate cyclase. This is intriguing, since yeast adenylate cyclase has a leucine-rich repeat regulatory domain. The leucine-rich repeat and putative metal-binding domains suggest a possible regulatory role that may involve adenylate cyclase activity or nucleic acid binding.",1990,"A W Stadnyk, B L Smiley, P J Myler, K Stuart"

One of these is an ability to select mutants in cases where the gene is known and has been cloned, but where we are ignorant of the associated phenotype. We describe here a solution to this problem as applied to a model system, the singed (sn) locus. Our method is a combination of classical genetics and molecular biology: sib selection plus the polymerase chain reaction. We have used the method to isolate rare individuals with P-element-induced alleles of sn merely by recognition of the DNA structures induced at the locus by transposon insertion. Phenotypic criteria were used only retrospectively to verify our diagnoses. There are obvious implications of this technique for the mutagenesis of other organisms.",1990,"K Kaiser, S F Goodwin"
[Formation of interdisks from the P-element DNA material in Drosophila polytene chromosomes],2162310,,"Electron microscopical (EM) analysis of regions of Drosophila melanogaster polytene chromosomes containing a matrial of the P element was carried out. In one of the stocks analysed the DNA fragment of 54 kb in length was inserted in the genome by the P element-mediated transformation. This fragment consists of four tandemly repeated copies of the rosy gene and each of them has P-DNAs at the terminal sites. In polytene chromosomes the fragment forms a complex of loose chromatin, where, nevertheless, it is possible to distinguish four bands. EM analysis of two regions with the P element in other stock reveals lengthening of interbands, as compared with the same interbands in the initial stock without the P element. In the third of the stocks analysed the P element was inserted in the region of vermilion gene which is situated in the large single band, 10A1-2 of the X-chromosome. In this case, the splitting of the band into two unequal parts and formation of a new interband was observed. Data obtained show the possibility of interband formation from DNA material of the P element, which is probably connected with its transcriptional activity.",1990,"M Peres Alonso, V F Semeshin, S A Demakov, I F Zhimulev"
Type I (R1) and type II (R2) ribosomal DNA insertions of Drosophila melanogaster are retrotransposable elements closely related to those of Bombyx mori,1690812,10.1016/0022-2836(90)90303-4,"Approximately 50% of the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) units of Drosophila melanogaster are inactivated by two different 28 S RNA ribosomal gene insertions (type I and type II). We present here the nucleotide sequence of complete type I and type II elements. Conceptual translation of these sequences revealed open reading frames (ORFs) encoding amino acid residues conserved in all retrotransposable elements. Full-length type I elements are 5.35 x 10(3) base-pairs in length and contain two overlapping ORFs. The smaller ORF (471 amino acid residues) has similarity to gag genes, while the larger ORF (1021 residues) has similarity to pol genes. Full-length type II elements are 3.6 x 10(3) base-pairs and contain one large ORF (1056 residues) that appears to represent a gag-pol fusion. Type I and type II elements are similar in structure, in the proteins they encode, and in insertion specificity to the R1Bm and R2Bm retrotransposable elements of Bombyx mori. We suggest that the D. melanogaster elements be called R1Dm and R2Dm, to reflect their structure as retrotransposons. Comparison of the R1 and R2 elements from these two widely different species revealed regions of the ORF that are likely to play an important role in the propagation of the elements. Four distinct regions of sequence conservation separated by regions of little or no sequence similarity were detected for both the R1 and R2 elements: (1) cysteine motifs of the gag gene, with three such motifs for R1 and one motif for R2; (2) a reverse transcriptase domain; (3) an integrase domain located carboxyl terminal to the reverse transcriptase region; and (4) a small region amino terminal to the reverse transcriptase domain, whose function is not known. The level of identity of the amino acid residues for these segments is 28 to 34% between the R1 elements, and 34 to 39% for the R2 elements. Finally, it may be predicted that the mechanism of unequal crossover might eventually eliminate R1 and R2 from the rDNA locus. The long history of selection at the protein level exhibited by these elements indicates that it is their active transposition that maintains them in the locus. The high level of sequence homogeneity between copies of each element within the same species is consistent with the high turnover rate expected to result from these processes.",1990,"T H Eickbush, Y Xiong, J L Jakubczak"
Closely related DNA sequences specify distinct patterns of developmental expression in Drosophila melanogaster,2111452,10.1128/mcb.10.6.3272,"Three short synthetic DNA sequences, which are closely related to one another, confer three distinct patterns of developmental expression on the heat shock hsp70 gene in transgenic Drosophila melanogaster lines. These results show that small variations or even single base pair changes in a repeated element of a regulatory sequence can create promoters that display new specificities of tissue and developmental regulation. Interestingly, the three patterns of developmental expression conferred by the synthetic DNAs resemble in part those of the known developmental genes: glucose dehydrogenase (Gld), Dopa decarboxylase (Ddc), and salivary gland secretory proteins (Sgs), respectively. In each case, the defined regulatory region of the known developmental gene contains multiple sequences that are similar or identical to the synthetic sequence that confers a similar pattern of developmental expression on the hsp70 gene. Thus, these results are congruent with the view that short sequence elements in multiple copies can confer either simple or relatively complex patterns of developmental expression on a receptive promoter like that of hsp70. Furthermore, the fact that the three variants tested produced three distinct patterns of expression in transgenic animals suggests that the number of different elements is large.",1990,"J T Lis, H Xiao"

Immunocytochemical localization shows neurotactin protein at points of cell-cell contact. Using the anti-neurotactin monoclonal antibody BP-106, a neurotactin cDNA was isolated that encodes a 846 residue polypeptide. The chromosomal location of the neurotactin gene is 73C. The extracellular domain at the carboxyterminal end of the neurotactin protein shows a strong structural and sequence homology to serine esterases without retaining the amino acids forming the active center.

Different forms of Ultrabithorax proteins generated by alternative splicing are functionally equivalent,1976510,,"The Ubx gene of Drosophila normally produces several forms of Ubx proteins through alternative splicing of two microexons. We describe here two new viable Ubx mutations that show similar and almost wild-type adult phenotypes. Molecular characterization has shown that one of them, UbxMX17, is an inversion within the Ubx transcription unit including one of the microexons involved in alternative splicing. This results in mutant flies possessing a very abnormal array of Ubx proteins, probably including spliced forms not present in wild-type flies. Yet these protein products successfully substitute for the normal ones and allow virtually normal Ubx function. We argue that the different Ubx proteins are developmentally equivalent and that the slight mutant phenotype observed in UbxMX17 flies is not due to the abnormal set of Ubx proteins but to a breakpoint in a cis-regulatory region.",1990,"A Busturia, G Morata, I Vernos, A Macias, J Casanova"

Aminergic neurons in the brain of blowflies and Drosophila: dopamine- and tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive neurons and their relationship with putative histaminergic neurons,1346506,10.1007/BF00318701,"The distribution and morphology of neurons reacting with antisera against dopamine (DA), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and histamine (HA) were analyzed in the blowflies Calliphora erythrocephala and Phormia terraenovae. TH-immunoreactive (THIR) and HA-immunoreactive (HAIR) neurons were also mapped in the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster. The antisera against DA and TH specifically labeled the same neurons in the blowflies. About 300 neurons displayed DA immunoreactivity (DAIR) and THIR in the brain and subesophageal ganglion of the blowflies. Most of these neurons were located in bilateral clusters; some were distributed as bilateral pairs, and two ventral unpaired median (VUM) neurons were seen in the subesophageal ganglion. Immunoreactive processes were found in all compartments of the mushroom bodies except the calyces, in all divisions of the central body complex, in the medulla, lobula and lobula plate of the optic lobe, and in non-glomerular neuropil of protocerebrum, tritocerebrum and the subesophageal ganglion. No DA or TH immunoreactivity was seen in the antennal lobes. In Drosophila, neurons homologous to the blowfly neurons were detected with the TH antiserum. In Phormia and Drosophila, 18 HA-immunoreactive neurons were located in the protocerebrum and 2 in the subesophageal ganglion. The HAIR neurons arborized extensively, but except for processes in the lobula, all HAIR processes were seen in non-glomerular neuropil. The deuto- and tritocerebrum was devoid of HAIR processes. Double labeling experiments demonstrated that TH and HA immunoreactivity was not colocalized in any neuron. In some regions there was, however, substantial superposition between the two systems.

Promoter sequence containing (CT)n.(GA)n repeats is critical for the formation of the DNase I hypersensitive sites in the Drosophila hsp26 gene,1377279,10.1016/0022-2836(92)90099-6,"We have analyzed P-element-transformed lines carrying hsp26/lacZ transgenes with various deletions and substitutions within the Drosophila melanogaster hsp26 promoter region in order to identify the sequences required for the formation of the DNase I hypersensitive sites (DH sites). DH sites are generally found associated with promoters and enhancer elements of active and inducible eukaryotic genes, and are thought to be nucleosome-free regions of DNA that interact with regulatory proteins and the transcriptional machinery. There are two major DH sites located within the promoter region of the hsp26 gene, centered at -50 and at -350 (relative to the hsp26 transcription start site). The sequences from -135 to -85, which contain (CT)n.(GA)n repeats, contribute significantly to the formation of the DH sites in the hsp26 promoter region. Deletion or substitution of this (CT)n region drastically reduces the accessibility of the DNA at these sites to DNase I. This reduction in accessibility was quantified by measuring the susceptibility of the DNA within nuclei to cleavage at a restriction site within the DH site. In addition to the (CT)n region and the promoter at -85 to +11 (region P), one of two other regions must be present for effective creation of the DH sites: sequences between -351 and -135 (region A), or sequences between +11 and +632 (region D). Disruption of the wild-type chromatin structure, as assayed by the loss of accessibility to the DH sites, is correlated with a decrease in inducible transcriptional activity, even when the TATA box and heat shock regulatory elements are present in their normal positions.",1992,"Q Lu, S C Elgin, L L Wallrath, R L Glaser, J T Lis, B D Allan"

The purified engrailed homeodomain (En-HD) protected a DNA sequence, TTAATT, the core element of consensus sequences recognized by many other homeodomain proteins, from DNase I digestion. UV-CD spectra of the En-HD showed that it mainly consisted of alpha-helix. Based on one-dimensional 1H-NMR spectra, the tertiary structure of the En-HD was shown to be stable against temperature up to 50 degrees C and low pH.

Adult longevity of flies reared at 25°C was slightly greater than that of flies raised at 20 or 29°C when measured at all three temperatures. This may reflect the laboratory history of the strain. On the whole, it appeared that longevity was independent of adult body size.

By complementation tests in transgenic flies, cotransfection assays in cultured Drosophila cells and in vitro DNA-binding assays, we have found that the ftz activity is retained in the ftz-Scr chimera but is lost in the ftz-msh chimera, which is defective in binding to an Antennapedia (Antp)-class target site. Further studies with a series of back-mutants of the ftz-msh chimera have revealed that a set of class-specific DNA backbone-contacting residues in the HTH, particularly Arg-28 and Arg-43, are required for efficient target site recognition and, hence, full ftz activity both in vitro and in vivo.",1992,"K Furukubo-Tokunaga, M Müller, M Affolter, L Pick, W J Gehring, U Kloter"
Neuroectodermal autonomy of Hox-2.9 expression revealed by rhombomere transpositions,1545869,10.1038/356157a0,"Involvement of the Hox genes in regional specifications of the vertebrate body axis is suggested by sequence similarity with the homeotic selector genes of Drosophila, the conservation of a collinear relationship between genomic organization and site of expression, and mutational analysis. Subdivision of vertebrate embryo hindbrain neuroepithelium into lineage compartments (rhombomeres) underlies segmental patterning of neuronal differentiation. The rhombomere boundaries delimit domains of expression of Hox genes, presumed to be determinants of rhombomere phenotype, suggesting that Hox genes confer positional value; the formation of rhombomere 4 (r4) is followed by strong expression of Hox-2.9 within its confines. If the Hox genes are determinants, their expression should be autonomous from the developmental stage at which regional commitment becomes fixed and irreversible. We have transplanted the future r4 region (from state-9-chick embryos) into the more anterior position of r2 and probed for Hox-2.9 transcripts. We report here that Hox-2.9 was expressed in the ectopic r4 as strongly as in the normal r4, whereas reciprocal grafts of future r2 to r4 position did not express Hox-2.9. The phenotype of ectopic rhombomeres developed according to their original position, as demonstrated by retrograde tracing of efferent cranial nerve nuclei. As early as stage-9-(six somites), both Hox-2.9 expression and segment identity are autonomous in the chick embryo hindbrain, independent both of position in the neuroepithelium and of signals from the underlying mesoderm.",1992,"A Lumsden, S Guthrie, I Muchamore, A Kuroiwa, H Marshall, R Krumlauf"
Interspecific comparison of the transformer gene of Drosophila reveals an unusually high degree of evolutionary divergence,1592233,,"The transformer (tra) gene of Drosophila melanogaster occupies an intermediate position in the regulatory pathway controlling all aspects of somatic sexual differentiation. The female-specific expression of this gene's function is regulated by the Sex lethal (Sxl) gene, through a mechanism involving sex-specific alternative splicing of tra pre-mRNA. The tra gene encodes a protein that is thought to act in conjunction with the transformer-2 (tra-2) gene product to control the sex-specific processing of doublesex (dsx) pre-mRNA. The bifunctional dsx gene carries out opposite functions in the two sexes, repressing female differentiation in males and repressing male differentiation in females. Here we report the results from an evolutionary approach to investigate tra regulation and function, by isolating the tra-homologous genes from selected Drosophila species, and then using the interspecific DNA sequence comparisons to help identify regions of functional significance. The tra-homologous genes from two Sophophoran subgenus species, Drosophila simulans and Drosophila erecta, and two Drosophila subgenus species, Drosophila hydei and Drosophila virilis, were cloned, sequenced and compared to the D. melanogaster tra gene. This comparison reveals an unusually high degree of evolutionary divergence among the tra coding sequences. These studies also highlight a highly conserved sequence within intron one that probably defines a cis-acting regulator of the sex-specific alternative splicing event.",1992,"M T O'Neil, J M Belote"

No information exists about the stereochemical conditions at the beta-C-atom (C-atom 3) of this side chain.

A protocol for processing the delicate larval and prepupal salivary glands of Drosophila for scanning electron microscopy,30912875,10.1002/jemt.23263,"Although scanning electron microscopy (SEM) has been broadly used for the examination of fixed whole insects or their hard exoskeleton-derived structures, including model organisms such as Drosophila, the routine use of SEM to evaluate vulnerable soft internal organs and tissues was often hampered by their fragile nature and frequent surface contamination. Here, we describe a simple four-step protocol that allows for the reliable and reproducible preparation of the larval and prepupal salivary glands (SGs) of Drosophila for SEM devoid of any surface contamination. The steps are to: first, proteolytically digest the adhering fat body; second, use detergent washes to remove contaminating coarse tissue fragments, including sticky remnants of the fat body; third, use nonionic emulsifying polysorbate emulsifiers to remove fine contaminants from the SGs surface; and fourth, use aminopolycarboxylate-based chelating agents to detach sessile hemocytes. Short but repeated rinses in 100 μL of a saline-based buffer between steps ensure efficient removal of remnants removed by each treatment. After these steps, the SGs are fixed in glutaraldehyde, postfixed in osmium tetroxide, dehydrated, critically point-dried, mounted on aluminum stubs, sputter coated with gold-palladium alloy and examined in the SEM.",2019,"Denisa Beňová-Liszeková, Robert Farkaš, Milan Beňo"
"Pericardin, a Drosophila collagen, facilitates accumulation of hemocytes at the heart",31228417,10.1016/j.ydbio.2019.06.006,"Hematopoietic cell lineages support organismal needs by responding to positional and systemic signals that balance proliferative and differentiation events. Drosophila provides an excellent genetic model to dissect these signals, where the activity of cues in the hemolymph or substrate can be traced to determination and differentiation events of well characterized hemocyte types. Plasmatocytes in third instar larvae increase in number in response to infection and in anticipation of metamorphosis. Here we characterize hemocyte clustering, proliferation and transdifferentiation on the heart or dorsal vessel. Hemocytes accumulate on the inner foldings of the heart basement membrane, where they move with heart contraction, and are in proximity to the heart ostia and pericardial nephrocytes. The numbers of hemocytes vary, but increase transiently before pupariation, and decrease by 4 h before pupa formation. During their accumulation at the heart, plasmatocytes can proliferate and can transdifferentiate into crystal cells. Serrate expressing cells as well as lamellocyte-like, Atilla expressing ensheathing cells are associated with some, but not all hemocyte clusters. Hemocyte aggregation is enhanced by the presence of a heart specific Collagen, Pericardin, but not the associated pericardial cells. The varied and transient number of hemocytes in the pericardial compartment suggests that this is not a hematopoietic hub, but a niche supporting differentiation and rapid dispersal in response to systemic signals.",2019,"Duygu Cevik, Meryl Acker, J Roger Jacobs, Camilla Michalski"
Improved activity and expression of recombinant human factor IX by propeptide engineering,31637661,10.1007/s40199-019-00299-8,"Purpose: The main therapeutic strategy for Hemophilia B patients involves the administration of recombinant coagulation factors IX (rFIX). Although there are various approaches to increasing the activity of rFIX, targeted protein engineering of specific residues could result in increased rFIX activity through enhanced γ-carboxylation. Specific amino acids in the propeptide sequence of vitamin K-dependent proteins are known to play a role in the interaction with the enzyme γ-carboxylase. The net hydrophobicity and charge of the γ-carboxylic recognition site (γ-CRS) region in the propeptide are important determinants of γ-carboxylase binding. So the contribution of individual γ-CRS residues to the expression of fully γ-carboxylated and active FIX was studied. Methods: Propeptide residues at positions -14, -13, or - 12 were substituted for equivalent prothrombin amino acids by SEOing PCR. The recombinant FIX variants were transfected and stably expressed in Drosophila S2 cells, and the expression of both total FIX protein and active FIX was assessed. Results: While overall the substitutions resulted in an increase of both total FIX protein expression as well as an increase in the portion of active FIX, the highest increase in FIX protein expression, FIX activity, and specific FIX activity was observed following the simultaneous substitution of residues at positions -12, -13, and - 14. The enhanced rFIX activity was further confirmed by enrichment for functional, fully γ-carboxylated rFIX species via barium citrate adsorption. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that by increasing both the net charge and the net hydrophobicity of the FIX γ-CRS region, the expression of fully γ-carboxylated and as such active FIX is enhanced.

A putative direct repeat element plays a dual role in the induction and repression of insect vitellogenin-1 gene expression,31022468,10.1016/j.cbpb.2019.04.003,"Juvenile hormones (JH) regulate wide-ranging physiological and developmental processes in insects. However, molecular mechanisms underlying JH signaling remain to be determined. Vitellogenin (Vg) is primarily an egg-yolk protein, but recently proposed to serve many functions in insects. In the female American cockroach (Periplaneta americana), vitellogenin (Vg) genes are activated by JH III and suppressed by 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) via cis-regulatory elements in a dose-dependent manner. In the present study, the upstream promoter region (935 bp) of Vg1 was cloned to elucidate the action of these hormones. A luciferase reporter assay identified an 81 bp region in the promoter region of Vg1 (-120 to -39 bp) that we found to be critical for JH III activation and 20E suppression. This 81 bp region contains a direct repeat separated by a 2-nucleotide spacer-designated Vg1HRE- that is similar to the Drosophila ecdysone response element direct repeat 4. Moreover, nuclear proteins isolated from nymphs, males, females, and Sf9 cells successfully bound to Vg1HRE, while binding was outcompeted by a 100-fold excess of cold probe or dephosphorylated nuclear protein extracts. In addition, binding was outcompeted by other ecdysone and JH response elements with similar half-site sequences (direct repeats) but to varying extents. Ultimately, we postulate that JH III indirectly activates Vg expression by interfering with or inhibiting the phosphorylation of nuclear proteins bound to Vg1HRE. Involvement of JH III in both induction of Vg1 and control of nuclear proteins binding to Vg1HRE suggest the latter to play an important role in JH signaling.",2019,"Azza M Elgendy, Makio Takeda, Amr A Mohamed, Muhammad Tufail"
Srlp is crucial for the self-renewal and differentiation of germline stem cells via RpL6 signals in Drosophila testes,30931935,10.1038/s41419-019-1527-z,"Self-renewal and differentiation in germline stem cells (GSCs) are tightly regulated by the stem cell niche and via multiple approaches.

Here, using genetic manipulation of the Drosophila model, we systematically analyze the function and mechanism of Srlp in vivo and in vitro. In Drosophila, Srlp is an essential gene that regulates the self-renewal and differentiation of GSCs in the testis. In the in vitro assay, Srlp is found to control the proliferation ability and cell death in S2 cells, which is consistent with the phenotype observed in Drosophila testis. Furthermore, results of the liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) reveal that RpL6 binds to Srlp. Srlp also regulates the expression of spliceosome and ribosome subunits and controls spliceosome and ribosome function via RpL6 signals.

This new PTEN function requires the enzymatic action of dPLCXD, an atypical phospholipase C. Importantly, we discovered that this novel PTEN/dPLCXD pathway can compensate for depletion of dOCRL, a PtdIns(4,5)P2 phosphatase. Mutation of OCRL1, the human orthologue of dOCRL, causes oculocerebrorenal Lowe syndrome, a rare multisystemic genetic disease. Both OCRL1 and dOCRL loss have been shown to promote accumulation of PtdIns(4,5)P2 on endosomes and cytokinesis defects. Here, we show that PTEN or dPLCXD overexpression prevents these defects. In addition, we found that chemical activation of this pathway restores normal cytokinesis in human Lowe syndrome cells and rescues OCRL phenotypes in a zebrafish Lowe syndrome model. Our findings identify a novel PTEN/dPLCXD pathway that controls PtdIns(4,5)P2 levels on endosomes.

"Daywake, an Anti-siesta Gene Linked to a Splicing-Based Thermostat from an Adjoining Clock Gene",31080079,10.1016/j.cub.2019.04.039,"Sleep is fundamental to animal survival but is a vulnerable state that also limits how much time can be devoted to critical wake-dependent activities [1]. Although many animals are day-active and sleep at night, they exhibit a midday nap, or ""siesta,"" that can vary in intensity and is usually more prominent on warm days. In humans, the balance between maintaining the wake state or sleeping during the day has important health implications [2], but the mechanisms underlying this dynamic regulation are poorly understood. Using the well-established Drosophila melanogaster animal model to study sleep [3], we identify a new wake-sleep regulator that we term daywake (dyw). dyw encodes a juvenile hormone-binding protein [4] that functions in neurons as a day-specific anti-siesta gene, with little effect on sleep levels during the nighttime or in the absence of light. Remarkably, dyw expression is stimulated in trans via cold-enhanced splicing of the dmpi8 intron [5] from the reverse-oriented but slightly overlapping period (per) clock gene [6]. The functionally integrated dmpi8-dyw genetic unit operates as a ""behavioral temperate acclimator"" by increasingly counterbalancing siesta-promoting pathways as daily temperatures become cooler and carry reduced risks from daytime heat exposure. While daily patterns of when animals are awake and when they sleep are largely scheduled by the circadian timing system, dyw implicates a less recognized class of modulatory wake-sleep regulators that primarily function to enhance flexibility in wake-sleep preference, a behavioral plasticity that is commonly observed in animals during the midday, raising the possibility of shared mechanisms.",2019,"Isaac Edery, Yong Yang"
The formin Drosophila homologue of Diaphanous2 (Diaph2) controls microtubule dynamics in colorectal cancer cells independent of its FH2-domain,30926831,10.1038/s41598-019-41731-y,"In this study, we analyzed the functional role of the formin Drosophila Homologue of Diaphanous2 (Diaph2) in colorectal cancer cells. We show that stable down-regulation of Diaph2 expression in HT29 cells decreased chromosome alignment and the velocity of chromosome movement during M-phase, thus reducing the proliferation rate and colony formation. In interphase cells, Diaph2 was diffusely distributed in the cytosol, while in metaphase cells the protein was located to spindle microtubules (MTs). Diaph2-depletion increased the concentration of stable spindle MTs, showing that the formin is required to control spindle MT-dynamics. Our cellular data indicate that Diaph2-controls spindle MT-dynamics independent of Cdc42 activity and our in vitro results reveal that bacterially produced full-length (FL) Diaph2 strongly altered MT-dynamics in absence of Cdc42, where its actin-nucleating activity is auto-inhibited. FL-Diaph2 mediates a 10-fold increase in MT-polymerization compared to the Diaph2-FH2-domain. Interestingly, a Diaph2-mutant lacking the FH2-domain (ΔFH2) increased MT-polymerization to a similar extent as the FH2-domain, indicating the existence of a second MT-binding domain. However, in contrast to FL-Diaph2 and the FH2-domain, ΔFH2 did not alter the density of taxol-stabilized MTs. Thus, the FH2-domain and the second Diaph2-binding domain appear to control MT-dynamics by different mechanisms. In summary, our data indicate that Diaph2 controls M-phase progression under basal conditions by regulating spindle MT-dynamics. In addition, a region outside of the canonical MT-regulating FH2-domain is involved in Diaph2-mediated control of MT-dynamics.",2019,"Yannes Popp, Yuan-Na Lin, Saskia S Grueb, Matthias Geyer, Stefanie Muhs, Sabine Windhorst, Sebastian Schmitt"

However, the adaptation of certain organisms to extreme conditions raises questions about the structural features that permit the structure and function of proteins to be preserved under these adverse conditions. To gain insight into the molecular basis of protein thermostability in the globin family, we have examined three representative examples: human neuroglobin, horse heart myoglobin, and Drosophila hemoglobin, which differ in their melting temperatures and coordination states of the heme iron in the absence of external ligands. In order to elucidate the possible mechanisms that govern the thermostability of these proteins, microsecond-scale classical molecular dynamics simulations were performed at different temperatures. Structural fluctuations and essential dynamics were analyzed, indicating that the flexibility of the CD region, which includes the two short C and D helixes and the connecting CD loop, is directly related to the thermostability. We observed that a larger inherent flexibility of the protein produces higher thermostability, probably concentrating the thermal fluctuations observed at high temperature in flexible regions, preventing unfolding.

In the present study, we examined whether simultaneous feeding of familiar anti-obesity drugs, quercetin glycosides (QG) and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), to Drosophila has the same suppressive effect on fat accumulation as previously reported in rats and mice. To understand the underlying molecular mechanisms of HFD diet-induced obesity and the suppression effect of the drugs, we performed transcriptome analyses. Materials and methods: We induced extra fat accumulation by feeding Drosophila fly food containing 20% coconut oil and quantified the triglyceride accumulated in flies. The effects of anti-obesity drugs were also evaluated. We isolated total RNA from each sample and performed RNA-seq analyses and quantitive Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) to investigate altered gene expression. Results: The mRNA levels of several genes involved in lipid metabolism, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, and anti-oxidative stress changed in HFD-fed adults. Moreover, the levels altered in those fed an HFD with QG or EGCG. The qRT-PCR further confirmed the RNA-seq data, suggesting that the expression of five essential genes for lipid metabolism changed in HFD-fed flies and altered in the flies treated with anti-obesity drugs. The most remarkable alteration was observed in the dHSL gene encoding a lipase involved in lipid-storage after HFD feeding and HFD with QG or EGCG. These alterations are consistent with HFD-induced fat accumulation as well as the anti-obesity effects of the drugs in mammals, suggesting that the genes play an important role in anti-obesity effects.

In Vivo Optical Calcium Imaging of Learning-Induced Synaptic Plasticity in Drosophila melanogaster,31657798,10.3791/60288,"Decades of research in many model organisms have led to the current concept of synaptic plasticity underlying learning and memory formation. Learning-induced changes in synaptic transmission are often distributed across many neurons and levels of processing in the brain. Therefore, methods to visualize learning-dependent synaptic plasticity across neurons are needed. The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster represents a particularly favorable model organism to study neuronal circuits underlying learning. The protocol presented here demonstrates a way in which the processes underlying the formation of associative olfactory memories, i.e., synaptic activity and their changes, can be monitored in vivo. Using the broad array of genetic tools available in Drosophila, it is possible to specifically express genetically encoded calcium indicators in determined cell populations and even single cells. By fixing a fly in place, and opening the head capsule, it is possible to visualize calcium dynamics in these cells whilst delivering olfactory stimuli. Additionally, we demonstrate a set-up in which the fly can be subjected, simultaneously, to electric shocks to the body. This provides a system in which flies can undergo classical olfactory conditioning - whereby a previously naïve odor is learned to be associated with electric shock punishment - at the same time as the representation of this odor (and other untrained odors) is observed in the brain via two-photon microscopy. Our lab has previously reported the generation of synaptically localized calcium sensors, which enables one to confine the fluorescent calcium signals to pre- or postsynaptic compartments. Two-photon microscopy provides a way to spatially resolve fine structures. We exemplify this by focusing on neurons integrating information from the mushroom body, a higher-order center of the insect brain. Overall, this protocol provides a method to examine the synaptic connections between neurons whose activity is modulated as a result of olfactory learning.",2019,"André Fiala, Clare E Hancock, Florian Bilz"

In this work, we present our analyses of the schlaff (slf) gene coding for a putative C-type lectin that is needed for the adhesion between the horizontal cuticle layers. The Slf protein mainly localizes between the two layers called epicuticle and procuticle that separate from each other when the function of Slf is reduced or eliminated paralleling the phenotype of a cuticle with reduced extracellular dityrosine. Localisation of the dityrosinylated protein Resilin to the epicuticle-procuticle interface suggests that the dityrosine network mediates the adhesion of the epicuticle to the procuticle. Ultimately, compromised Slf function is associated with massive water loss. In summary, we propose that Slf is implied in the stabilisation of a dityrosine layer especially between the epicuticle and the procuticle that in turn constitutes an outward barrier against uncontrolled water flow.",2019,"Slawomir Bartoszewski, Hsin-Nin Ho, Anna Speidel, Heinz Schwarz, Khaleelulla Saheb Shaik, Frauke Meyer, Bernard Moussian, Renata Zuber, Nicole Gehring"
The Genome of Drosophila innubila Reveals Lineage-Specific Patterns of Selection in Immune Genes,30865231,10.1093/molbev/msz059,"Pathogenic microbes can exert extraordinary evolutionary pressure on their hosts. They can spread rapidly and sicken or even kill their host to promote their own proliferation. Because of this strong selective pressure, immune genes are some of the fastest evolving genes across metazoans, as highlighted in mammals and insects. Drosophila melanogaster serves as a powerful model for studying host/pathogen evolution. While Drosophila melanogaster are frequently exposed to various pathogens, little is known about D. melanogaster's ecology, or if they are representative of other Drosophila species in terms of pathogen pressure. Here, we characterize the genome of Drosophila innubila, a mushroom-feeding species highly diverged from D. melanogaster and investigate the evolution of the immune system. We find substantial differences in the rates of evolution of immune pathways between D. innubila and D. melanogaster. Contrasting what was previously found for D. melanogaster, we find little evidence of rapid evolution of the antiviral RNAi genes and high rates of evolution in the Toll pathway. This suggests that, while immune genes tend to be rapidly evolving in most species, the specific genes that are fastest evolving may depend either on the pathogens faced by the host and/or divergence in the basic architecture of the host's immune system.",2019,"Boryana S Koseva, Robert L Unckless, Tom Hill"
Heat hardening capacity in Drosophila melanogaster is life stage-specific and juveniles show the highest plasticity,30958125,10.1098/rsbl.2018.0628,"Variations in stress resistance and adaptive plastic responses during ontogeny have rarely been addressed, despite the possibility that differences between life stages can affect species' range margins and thermal tolerance. Here, we assessed the thermal sensitivity and hardening capacity of Drosophila melanogaster across developmental stages from larval to the adult stage. We observed strong differences between life stages in heat resistance, with adults being most heat resistant followed by puparia, pupae and larvae. The impact of heat hardening (1 h at 35°C) on heat resistance changed during ontogeny, with the highest positive effect of hardening observed in puparia and pupae and the lowest in adults. These results suggest that immobile life stages ( puparia and pupae) have evolved high plasticity in upper thermal limits whereas adults and larvae rely more on behavioural responses to heat stress allowing them to escape from extreme high temperatures. While most studies on the plasticity of heat resistance in ectotherms have focused on the adult life stage, our findings emphasize the crucial importance of juvenile life stages of arthropods in understanding the thermal biology and life stage-specific physiological responses to variable and stressful high temperatures. Failure to acknowledge this complication might lead to biased estimates of species' ability to cope with environmental changes, such as climate change.",2019,"Tarmo Ketola, Neda N Moghadam, Cino Pertoldi, Simon Bahrndorff, Torsten N Kristensen"
Tools to reverse-engineer multicellular systems: case studies using the fruit fly,31049075,10.1186/s13036-019-0161-8,"Reverse-engineering how complex multicellular systems develop and function is a grand challenge for systems bioengineers. This challenge has motivated the creation of a suite of bioengineering tools to develop increasingly quantitative descriptions of multicellular systems. Here, we survey a selection of these tools including microfluidic devices, imaging and computer vision techniques. We provide a selected overview of the emerging cross-talk between engineering methods and quantitative investigations within developmental biology. In particular, the review highlights selected recent examples from the Drosophila system, an excellent platform for understanding the interplay between genetics and biophysics.

Distinct metabolic profiles in Drosophila sperm and somatic tissues revealed by two-photon NAD(P)H and FAD autofluorescence lifetime imaging,31862926,10.1038/s41598-019-56067-w,"Metabolic profiles vary across all levels of biological diversity, from cells to taxa. Two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) facilitates metabolic characterisation of biological specimens by assaying the intrinsic autofluorescence of the ubiquitous coenzymes NAD(P)H and FAD. The potential of this method for characterising the diversity of organismal metabolism remains largely untapped. Using FLIM in Drosophila melanogaster, we show tissue-specificity in fluorescence lifetime that reflects variation in redox patterns. In particular, sperm cells exhibited elevated glycolysis relative to other tissues. We also show that sperm metabolism is phenotypically plastic: compared to male-stored sperm, sperm stored in the female's storage organ showed a substantial reduction in the protein-bound FAD lifetime fraction but no change in the NAD(P)H profile. This study represents the first ex vivo investigation of sperm metabolism using FLIM.",2019,"Klaus Reinhardt, Cornelia Wetzker"
Evolutionary change of codon usage for the histone gene family in Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila hydei,10837157,10.1006/mpev.1999.0749,"The nucleotide divergence in the protein-coding region for replication-dependent and replication-independent histone 3 and 4 genes of Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila hydei occurred mostly at the synonymous site. Therefore, the pattern of codon usage was analyzed in the two species, considering the genomic codon bias, which is proposed for estimating the genomic composition pressure in the protein-coding regions. The results indicated that the codon usage in the histone gene family could be explained mostly by the genomic codon bias. However, biases for Ala and Arg were commonly observed for the histone 3 and histone 4 gene families, and biases for Ser, Leu, and Glu were observed in a gene-specific manner. This suggests that both genomic codon bias and gene- or codon-specific bias are responsible for the nucleotide differentiation in the protein-coding region of the histone genes.",2000,Y Matsuo
Toll-like receptors confer responsiveness to lipopolysaccharide from Porphyromonas gingivalis in human gingival fibroblasts,10816537,10.1128/iai.68.6.3731-3735.2000,"Gingival fibroblasts produce proinflammatory cytokines in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from periodontopathic bacteria.

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) have been identified in myeloid cells; however, their role in nonmyeloid cells such as gingival fibroblasts has not been fully elucidated. Here, we report that human gingival fibroblasts constitutively express TLR2 and TLR4 and that their levels of expression are increased by stimulation with LPS from Porphyromonas gingivalis. Upregulated expression of interleukin-6 gene and protein in fibroblasts stimulated with LPS is inhibited by anti-TLR4 antibody.

The fusome organizes the microtubule network during oocyte differentiation in Drosophila,10976056,,"Differentiation of the Drosophila oocyte takes place in a cyst of 16 interconnected germ cells and is dependent on a network of microtubules that becomes polarized as differentiation progresses (polarization). We have investigated how the microtubule network polarizes using a GFP-tubulin construct that allows germ-cell microtubules to be visualized with greater sensitivity than in previous studies. Unexpectedly, microtubules are seen to associate with the fusome, an asymmetric germline-specific organelle, which elaborates as cysts form and undergoes complex changes during cyst polarization. This fusome-microtubule association occurs periodically during late interphases of cyst divisions and then continuously in 16-cell cysts that have entered meiotic prophase. As meiotic cysts move through the germarium, microtubule minus ends progressively focus towards the center of the fusome, as visualized using a NOD-lacZ marker. During this same period, discrete foci rich in gamma tubulin that very probably correspond to migrating cystocyte centrosomes also associate with the fusome, first on the fusome arms and then in its center, subsequently moving into the differentiating oocyte. The fusome is required for this complex process, because microtubule network organization and polarization are disrupted in hts(1) mutant cysts, which lack fusomes. Our results suggest that the fusome, a specialized membrane-skeletal structure, which arises in early germ cells, plays a crucial role in polarizing 16-cell cysts, at least in part by interacting with microtubules and centrosomes.",2000,"N C Grieder, A C Spradling, M de Cuevas"
Effects of density and larval competition on selected life history traits of Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus (Diptera: Culicidae),11004786,10.1603/0022-2585-37.5.732,"The effects of larval densities of one to four individuals in standard Drosophila-vials (diameter 25 by 95 mm) on the age at pupation, starved dry weight, and wing length of Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus Say were studied. This approach required relatively few larvae per replicate and included a control treatment, where individual larvae developed in the absence of competition. This design also tested for competitive interactions between male and female larvae. Mosquitoes pupated later, and emerged with lighter starved dry adult weight and shorter wings as larval density increased. The size of adult female mosquitoes, particularly their starved dry weight, was sensitive to larval density and also was influenced by the presence or absence of competition with another female larva. In contrast, the life history traits of males did not vary as a function of competition with female larva. Female larvae were also more likely to die in the highest density treatment. This design confirmed previous results and offered a potentially useful experimental approach to investigate the effects of density-dependent competition among mosquito larvae.",2000,"Y Michalakis, C Haussy, P Agnew"
"DRacGAP, a novel Drosophila gene, inhibits EGFR/Ras signalling in the developing imaginal wing disc",11076763,,"We have identified a novel Drosophila gene, DRacGAP, which behaves as a negative regulator of &Rgr;-family GTPases DRac1 and DCdc42. Reduced function of DRacGAP or increased expression of DRac1 in the wing imaginal disc cause similar effects on vein and sensory organ development and cell proliferation. These effects result from enhanced activity of the EGFR/Ras signalling pathway. We find that in the wing disc, DRac1 enhances EGFR/Ras-dependent activation of MAP Kinase in the prospective veins. Interestingly, DRacGAP expression is negatively regulated by the EGFR/Ras pathway in these regions. During vein formation, local DRacGAP repression would ensure maximal activity of Rac and, in turn, of Ras pathways in vein territories. Additionally, maximal expression of DRacGAP at the vein/intervein boundaries would help to refine the width of the veins. Hence, control of DRacGAP expression by the EGFR/Ras pathway is a previously undescribed feedback mechanism modulating the intensity and/or duration of its signalling during Drosophila development.",2000,"S Campuzano, S Sotillos"
Tcf/Lef transcription factors during T-cell development: unique and overlapping functions,11920163,10.1038/sj.thj.6200001,"The founding members of the TCF family are T-cell factor-1 (Tcf-1) and lymphoid enhancing factor-1 (Lef-1). In adult mammals, Tcf-1 is uniquely expressed in T lymphocytes, while Lef-1 is expressed in T cells and early B cells. During murine development, however, expression of Tcf-1 and Lef-1 occurs in complex overlapping patterns in many tissues. The unique in vivo function of Tcf-1 and Lef-1 have been explored by gene disruption experiments. Tcf-1-/- knockout mice are severely impaired in the generation of T cells, but are otherwise normal. Lef-1-/- mice lack hair, teeth, mammary glands and trigeminal nuclei and as a consequence die around birth. As deduced from direct analyses and from transplantation experiments, the Lef-1 mutation has no major effects on the immune system. In Tcf-1/Lef-1 double knockout mice, development of T cells is completely abrogated, indicating that Lef-1 can substitute for Tcf-1 in T-cell differentiation. Factors of the TCF/LEF HMG domain family (TCFs) exist throughout the animal kingdom. It has become evident that the TCFs interact with the vertebrate Wnt effector beta-catenin to mediate axis formation in Xenopus. Likewise, Armadillo (the Drosophila ortholog of beta-catenin) is genetically upstream of Drosophila TCF in the Wingless pathway. Upon Wingless/Wnt signaling, Armadillo/beta-catenin associate with nuclear TCFs and contribute a trans-activation domain to the resulting bipartite transcription factor. In the absence of Wnt signaling, Tcf factors associate with proteins of the Groucho family of transcriptional repressors to strongly repress target gene transcription.",2000,"F J Staal, H Clevers"
"Gram-negative bacteria-binding protein, a pattern recognition receptor for lipopolysaccharide and beta-1,3-glucan that mediates the signaling for the induction of innate immune genes in Drosophila melanogaster cells",10827089,10.1074/jbc.M003934200,"Pattern recognition receptors, non-clonal immune proteins recognizing common microbial components, are critical for non-self recognition and the subsequent induction of Rel/NF-kappaB-controlled innate immune genes. However, the molecular identities of such receptors are still obscure. Here, we present data showing that Drosophila possesses at least three cDNAs encoding members of the Gram-negative bacteria-binding protein (DGNBP) family, one of which, DGNBP-1, has been characterized. Western blot, flow cytometric, and confocal laser microscopic analyses demonstrate that DGNBP-1 exists in both a soluble and a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane form in culture medium supernatant and on Drosophila immunocompetent cells, respectively. DGNBP-1 has a high affinity to microbial immune elicitors such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and beta-1,3-glucan whereas no binding affinity is detected with peptidoglycan, beta-1,4-glucan, or chitin. Importantly, the overexpression of DGNBP-1 in Drosophila immunocompetent cells enhances LPS- and beta-1,3-glucan-induced innate immune gene (NF-kappaB-dependent antimicrobial peptide gene) expression, which can be specifically blocked by pretreatment with anti-DGNBP-1 antibody. These results suggest that DGNBP-1 functions as a pattern recognition receptor for LPS from Gram-negative bacteria and beta-1, 3-glucan from fungi and plays an important role in non-self recognition and the subsequent immune signal transmission for the induction of antimicrobial peptide genes in the Drosophila innate immune system.",2000,"P T Brey, W J Lee, K H Choi, I H Jang, K B Nam, B Lemaitre, S J Han, Y S Kim, J H Ryu"

Although maleless (mle) encodes a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) helicase, exactly how mle(napts) affects para expression remained uncertain. Here, we show that para transcripts undergo adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing via a mechanism that apparently requires dsRNA secondary structure formation encompassing the edited exon and the downstream intron. In an mle(napts) background, >80% of para transcripts are aberrant, owing to internal deletions that include the edited exon. We propose that the Mle helicase is required to resolve the dsRNA structure and that failure to do so in an mle(napts) background causes exon skipping because the normal splice donor is occluded. These results explain how mlen(napts) affects Na+ channel expression and provide new insights into the mechanism of RNA editing.",2000,"R A Reenan, B Ganetzky, C J Hanrahan"
CAAT sites are required for the activation of the H. pulcherrimus Ars gene by Otx,11151295,10.1007/s004270000102,"A product of sea urchin homologues of the Drosophila orthodenticle gene, HpOtxL has been implicated as a transcription activator of the aboral ectoderm-specific arylsulfatase (Ars) gene during early development of the sea urchin embryo. Using an in vivo transactivation system, we present evidence that HpOtxL activates the target gene by interacting with co-factors. Otx binding sites alone have little effect on the activity of an Ars promoter, but when both Otx binding sites and CAAT sequences are present in the enhancer region of Ars, the fragment shows a high enhancer activity. A gel mobility shift assay reveals that a nuclear protein binds to the CAAT sequences present near the Otx binding sites in the enhancer region of Ars. The activation domain of HpOtxL resides in the C terminal region between amino acids 218 and 238. The N-terminal region is responsible for the enhancement of transactivation of the Ars promoter, although the region itself does not function as an activation domain. HpOtxE, which possesses an N-terminal region different from HpOtxL, does not activate the Ars promoter even in the presence of CAAT sequences. Together with previous findings, our results suggest that Otx regulates different genes by interacting with different co-factors in sea urchin development.",2000,"K Sasai, K Mitsunaga-Nakatsubo, K Akasaka, H Shimada, K Takata, T Kiyama"
Drosophila Futsch regulates synaptic microtubule organization and is necessary for synaptic growth,10839356,10.1016/s0896-6273(00)81170-8,"We present evidence that Futsch, a novel protein with MAP1B homology, controls synaptic growth at the Drosophila neuromuscularjunction through the regulation of the synaptic microtubule cytoskeleton. Futsch colocalizes with microtubules and identifies cytoskeletal loops that traverse the lateral margin of select synaptic boutons. An apparent rearrangement of microtubule loop architecture occurs during bouton division, and a genetic analysis indicates that Futsch is necessary for this process. futsch mutations disrupt synaptic microtubule organization, reduce bouton number, and increase bouton size. These deficits can be partially rescued by neuronal overexpression of a futsch MAP1B homology domain. Finally, genetic manipulations that increase nerve-terminal branching correlate with increased synaptic microtubule loop formation, and both processes require normal Futsch function. These data suggest a common microtubule-based growth mechanism at the synapse and growth cone.",2000,"N Ng, J Roos, C Klämbt, G W Davis, T Hummel"
Chromosome condensation factor Brn1p is required for chromatid separation in mitosis,10749931,10.1091/mbc.11.4.1305,"This work describes BRN1, the budding yeast homologue of Drosophila Barren and Xenopus condensin subunit XCAP-H.

Chromatid cohesion before anaphase is properly maintained in the mutants. Some brn1 mutant cells apparently arrest in S-phase, pointing to a possible function for Brn1p at this stage of the cell cycle. Brn1p is a nuclear protein with a nonuniform distribution pattern, and its level is up-regulated at mitosis. Temperature-sensitive mutations of BRN1 can be suppressed by overexpression of a novel gene YCG1, which is homologous to another Xenopus condensin subunit, XCAP-G. Overexpression of SMC2, a gene necessary for chromosome condensation, and a homologue of the XCAP-E condensin, does not suppress brn1, pointing to functional specialization of components of the condensin complex.",2000,"O A Cabello, B R Brinkley, I I Ouspenski"
The effect of experience on the hunting success of newly emerged spiderlings,11124882,10.1006/anbe.2000.1546,"Initial interactions with prey may affect a predator's subsequent foraging success. With experience, second-instar Misumena vatia spiderlings (Thomisidae) that had recently emerged from their egg sacs oriented faster to fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) than näive individuals. Orientation time of these spiderlings decreased rapidly for the first two to three runs (every third day) in a simple laboratory setting, and then remained low and relatively constant. Time to capture a fly also declined initially, but subsequently became extremely variable, increasing prior to moult. Increase in capture time and the failure to capture prey appeared associated with impending moult, rather than satiation. Spiderlings oriented to prey more rapidly at the beginning of the third instar than at the start of the second instar, suggesting that experience still enhanced performance after a moult cycle. Overall capture times at the beginning of the third instar decreased from those at the end of the second instar, but did not differ significantly from the beginning of the second instar, although spiderlings gaining the most biomass had the shortest mean capture times. In a second experiment, time to orient and time to capture prey did not differ in näive, second-instar siblings run 1 and 3 days after emergence from their egg sacs. However, 3-day individuals that had captured prey each day (confiscated before they could feed) oriented faster than näive 3-day-old siblings, but did not differ in the time taken to capture prey.

Regulation of BMP/Dpp signaling during embryonic development,10950309,10.1007/PL00000736,"Bone morphogenetic protein-4 (BMP-4) and its Drosophila ortholog, decapentaplegic (Dpp), are multifunctional developmental regulators. Both gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies demonstrate that the biological activity and signaling range of these morphogens must be strictly regulated to ensure normal embryonic patterning. BMP-4 and Dpp are produced from inactive precursors that are proteolytically cleaved, following which the active ligand is secreted into the extracellular space. Binding of BMP-4 or Dpp to its cognate receptor leads to phosphorylation of intracellular signal-transducing Smad proteins that then form hetero-oligomers, translocate to the nucleus and modulate transcription of target genes. Recent studies have shown that the BMP signal transduction cascade can be modulated at every step of this process.",2000,"T Nakayama, Y Cui, J L Christian"

Repressors such as Knirps, Krüppel, and Snail mediate short-range repression and interact with the dCtBP corepressor. The mechanism by which short-range repressors block transcription is not well understood; therefore, we have undertaken a detailed structure-function analysis of the Knirps protein. To provide a physiological setting for measurement of repression, the activities of endogenous or chimeric Knirps repressor proteins were assayed on integrated reporter genes in transgenic embryos. Two distinct repression functions were identified in Knirps. One repression activity depends on dCtBP binding, and this function maps to a C-terminal region of Knirps that contains a dCtBP binding motif. In addition, an N-terminal region was identified that represses in a CtBP mutant background and does not bind to the dCtBP protein in vitro. Although the dCtBP protein is important for Knirps activity on some genes, one endogenous target of the Knirps protein, the even-skipped stripe 3 enhancer, is not derepressed in a CtBP mutant.

piwi encodes a nucleoplasmic factor whose activity modulates the number and division rate of germline stem cells,10631171,,"piwi represents the first class of genes known to be required for stem cell self-renewal in diverse organisms. In the Drosophila ovary, piwi is required in somatic signaling cells to maintain germline stem cells. Here we show that piwi encodes a novel nucleoplasmic protein present in both somatic and germline cells, with the highly conserved C-terminal region essential for its function. Removing PIWI protein from single germline stem cells significantly decreases the rate of their division. This suggests that PIWI has a second role as a cell-autonomous promoter of germline stem cell division. Consistent with its dual function, over-expression of piwi in somatic cells causes an increase both in the number of germline stem cells and the rate of their division. Thus, PIWI is a key regulator of stem cell division - its somatic expression modulates the number of germline stem cells and the rate of their division, while its germline expression also contributes to promoting stem cell division in a cell-autonomous manner.",2000,"D N Cox, A Chao, H Lin"
The APC tumour suppressor has a nuclear export function,10984057,10.1038/35023016,"The adenomatous polpyposis coli (APC) protein is mutated in most colorectal tumours. Nearly all APC mutations are truncations, and many of these terminate in the mutation cluster region located halfway through the protein. In cancer cells expressing mutant APC, beta-catenin is stabilized and translocates into the nucleus to act as a transcriptional co-activator of T-cell factor. During normal development, APC also promotes the destabilization of beta-catenin and Drosophila Armadillo. It does so by binding to the Axin complex which earmarks beta-catenin/Armadillo for degradation by the proteasome pathway. APC has a regulatory role in this process, which is poorly understood. Here we show that APC contains highly conserved nuclear export signals 3' adjacent to the mutation cluster region that enable it to exit from the nucleus. This ability is lost in APC mutant cancer cells, and we provide evidence that beta-catenin accumulates in the nucleus as a result. Thus, the ability of APC to exit from the nucleus appears to be critical for its tumour suppressor function.",2000,"M Bienz, F Townsley, R Rosin-Arbesfeld"
[Phases of the effect of the homeotic Walker mutation in the development of Drosophila melanogaster],10779909,,"In this work, critical ontogenetic stages for wing traits affected by temperature-sensitive mutation Walker (Wk) were determined. The interaction between the Wk gene and some genes responsible for the cell-cycle control was studied. At various ontogenetic stages, the mutants were exposed to 17 degrees C for 12 h, and, at the beginning of oviposition, the fly age was registered. Nine types of wing abnormalities were classified. The temperature treatment during three developmental stages (12-24, 48-60, and 96-108 h) resulted in a decrease in normal wing number and a substantial increase in wing abnormalities. Different morphological types of imaginal disks were revealed: nondifferentiated disks, those lacking the notum region, and those with duplications of wing-forming regions. The allele-specific interaction between Wk and allele v27 of the Klp61F gene was also revealed. We suggest that gene Wk is a high-ranking gene in the system of genetic control of ontogeny, because the Wk mutation is manifested in numerous phenotypic variants both in the control and in the experiment and a complete set of these variants was observed at each developmental stage upon temperature treatment. The pleiotropic effect of the Wk gene on the formation of some Drosophila organs, including eyes and halters which are beyond the scope of this report, is in agreement with this suggestion.",2000,"D P Furman, L V Omel'ianchuk"
Neutrality tests of conservative-radical amino acid changes in nuclear- and mitochondrially-encoded proteins,11164043,10.1016/s0378-1119(00)00483-2,"The neutralist-selectionist debate should not be viewed as a dichotomy but as a continuum. While the strictly neutral model suggests a neutralist-selectionist dichotomy, the nearly neutral model is a continuous model spanning strict neutrality through weak selection (Ns approximately 1) to deterministic selection (Ns>3). We illustrate these points with polymorphism and divergence data from a sample of 73 genes (31 mitochondrial, 36 nuclear genes from Drosophila, and six Arabidopsis data sets). In an earlier study we used the McDonald-Kreitman (MK) test to show that amino acid replacement polymorphism in animal mitochondrial genes and Arabidopsis genes show a consistent trend toward negative selection, whereas nuclear genes from Drosophila span a range from negative selection, through neutrality, to positive selection. Here we analyze a subset of these genes (13 Drosophila nuclear, ten mitochondrial, and six Arabidopsis nuclear) for polymorphism and divergence of conservative and radical amino acid replacements (a protein-based conservative-radical MK, or pMK, test). The distinct patterns of selection between the different genomes is not apparent with the pMK test. Different definitions of conservative and radical (based on amino acid polarity, volume or charge) give inconsistent results across genes. We suggest that segregating fitness difference between silent and replacement mutations are more visible to selection than are segregating fitness differences between conservative and radical amino acid mutations. New data on the variation among genes with different opportunities for positive and negative selection are as important to the continuum view of the neutralist-selectionist debate as is the distribution of selection coefficients within individual genes.",2000,"D M Weinreich, D M Rand, B O Cezairliyan"
Calcium homeostasis in larval and adult Drosophila melanogaster,10790183,10.1002/(SICI)1520-6327(200005)44:1<27::AID-ARCH4>3.0.CO;2-I,"Calcium homeostasis in Drosophila melanogaster was examined in response to the challenges imposed by growth, reproduction and variations in dietary calcium content. Turnover time for calcium, calculated as the time for (45)Ca(2+)to accumulate to half the steady state value of 3.46 nmol/fly, was 3.3 days. Although larvae weighed 2x as much as adults, they contained 3-4x as much calcium. Anterior Malpighian tubules (Mts) contain much more calcium than posterior Mts, accounting for 25-30% of the calcium content of the whole fly. In response to a 6.2-fold increase in dietary calcium level, calcium content of whole flies increased only 10%. Hemolymph calcium concentration ( approximately 0.5 mM) was similar in males and females and in animals raised on diets differing in calcium content. Fluid secretion rate, secreted fluid calcium concentration, and transepithelial calcium flux in tubules isolated from flies raised on high and low calcium diets did not differ significantly. Malpighian tubules secrete calcium at rates sufficient to eliminate whole body calcium content in 0.5 and 3 days for tubules secreting fluid at basal and maximal rates, respectively. It is suggested that flies absorb high quantities of calcium from the diet and maintain homeostasis through the combined effects of elimination of calcium in fluid secreted by the Malpighian tubules and the sequestration of calcium in granules, especially within the distal segment of the anterior pair of Malpighian tubules.",2000,"M J O'Donnell, K A Dube, D G McDonald"
Heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor contributes to reduced glomerular filtration rate during glomerulonephritis in rats,10675360,10.1172/JCI2869,"Heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF), a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family, is expressed during inflammatory and pathological conditions. We have cloned the rat HB-EGF and followed the expression of HB-EGF in rat kidneys treated with anti- glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) antibody (Ab) to induce glomerulonephritis (GN). We observed glomerular HB-EGF mRNA and protein within 30 minutes of Ab administration and showed by in situ hybridization that glomerular HB-EGF mRNA expression was predominantly in mesangial and epithelial cells. Expression of HB-EGF correlated with the onset of decreased renal function in this model. To test the direct effect of HB-EGF on renal function, we infused the renal cortex with active rHB-EGF, prepared from transfected Drosophila melanogaster cells. This treatment induced a significant decrease in single nephron GFR (SNGFR), single nephron plasma flow, and glomerular ultrafiltration coefficient and an increase in the glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure gradient. In addition, anti-HB-EGF Ab administered just before anti-GBM Ab blocked the fall in SNGFR and GFR at 90 minutes without any change in the glomerular histologic response. These studies suggest that HB-EGF expressed early in the anti-GBM Ab GN model contributes to the observed acute glomerular hemodynamic alterations.",2000,"F B Gabbai, J A Abraham, Y Xia, L Feng, Y Yang, R C Blantz, C B Wilson, G E Garcia, O W Peterson"
Characterization of the Hox cluster from the mosquito Anopheles gambiae (Diptera: Culicidae),11256376,10.1046/j.1525-142x.2000.00072.x,"The Hox genes have been found to encode transcription factors, which specify the morphological identity of structures along the anteroposterior axis of animals ranging from worms to mice. The canonical set of nine genes is organized in a cluster in the genome of several protostomes and deuterostomes. However, within insects, whereas the Hox genes are organized in a single cluster in the beetle Tribolium castaneum, they are split into two separate groups in the flies Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila virilis. The significance of a split Hox cluster is unknown and has been observed in only one organism outside the Drosophila lineage: the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We have cloned a majority of the Hox genes from the mosquito Anopheles gambiae (Diptera: Culicidae) and compared their genomic organization with that of Tribolium and Drosophila to determine if a split Hox cluster is found in dipterans aside from the Drosophilidae. We find that the Hox genes in Anopheles, as in Tribolium, are organized in a single cluster that spans a genomic region of at least 700 kb. This finding suggests that, within the insect genome, the partition of the Hox cluster may have evolved exclusively within the Drosophila lineage. The genomic structures of the resident genes, however, appear to be largely conserved between A. gambiae and D. melanogaster.",2000,"X Wang, K Dymbrowski, F H Collins, Z Ke, T P Powers, T C Kaufman, J Hogan"
Expression patterns of anterior Hox genes in the polychaete Chaetopterus: correlation with morphological boundaries,10625558,10.1006/dbio.1999.9541,"Expression patterns for five Hox genes were examined by whole-mount in situ hybridization in larvae of Chaetopterus, a polychaete annelid with a tagmatized axial body plan. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrates that these genes are orthologs of the Drosophila genes labial, proboscipedia, zen, Deformed, and Sex combs reduced and are termed CH-Hox1, CH-Hox2, CH-Hox3, CH-Hox4, and CH-Hox5, respectively. Expression studies reveal a biphasic expression pattern. In early larval stages, well before any indications of segmental organization exist, a novel pattern of expression in bilateral posterior proliferating cell populations, corresponding to the teloblasts, was detected for each of the genes, with CH-Hox1 and CH-Hox2 expressed before the remaining three. In middle larval stages, all five genes are expressed in bilateral strips along the ventral midline, corresponding with the developing ventral nerve cord. In addition, CH-Hox1 and CH-Hox2 show strong expression at the foregut-midgut boundary. By late larval stages the expression is generally confined to the ventral CNS and ectoderm of the anterior parapodia. Anterior boundaries of expression are ""colinear,"" at later larval stages, with CH-Hox2 expressed most rostrally, in the first segment, and anterior expression boundaries for CH-Hox1, CH-Hox3, CH-Hox4, and CH-Hox5 in segments 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively. Like vertebrates and spiders, but unlike insects, CH-Hox3 participates in this colinear axial expression pattern. CH-Hox1 and CH-Hox2 have distinct posterior boundaries of expression in the ninth segment, which corresponds to a major morphological boundary, and may reflect a reorganization of Hox gene regulation related to the evolutionary reorganization of the Chaetopterus body plan.",2000,"S Q Irvine, M Q Martindale"
Abnormal courtship conditioning in males mutant for the RI regulatory subunit of Drosophila protein kinase A,10858819,10.3109/01677069909083469,"The previously described site-selected P-element mutagenesis of a Drosophila gene encoding the regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase generates mutants that have defective behavior in the olfactory learning test. Here we describe the effect of the same mutations in a courtship conditioning assay. Wild-type males can distinguish between virgin females (which they court vigorously), and fertilized females (which they court less vigorously). After exposure to fertilized females, wild-type males modify their behavior by decreasing courtship to subsequent target virgins, an effect that may last for many hours. Like wild-type males, PKA-RI mutant males are also able to distinguish between virgin and fertilized females. PKA-RI males also modify their behavior towards virgin females after prior exposure to a fertilized female, but such an effect is short-lived, suggesting a defect in memory rather than learning. We also show that under these conditions the behavior of PKA-RI males is similar to that of amnesiac, dunce and rutabaga males.",1999,"D Jamieson, K Kaiser, S F Goodwin, K M O'Dell"
"The transmembrane region of Gurken is not required for biological activity, but is necessary for transport to the oocyte membrane in Drosophila",10559478,10.1016/s0925-4773(99)00196-3,"During Drosophila oogenesis, localization of the transforming growth factor alpha (TGFalpha)-like signaling molecule Gurken to the oocyte membrane is required for polarity establishment of the egg and embryo. To test Gurken domain functions, full-length and truncated forms of Gurken were expressed ectopically using the UAS/Gal4 expression system, or in the germline using the endogenous promoter. GrkDeltaC, a deletion of the cytoplasmic domain, localizes to the oocyte membrane and can signal. GrkDeltaTC, which lacks the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, retains signaling ability when ectopically expressed in somatic cells. However, in the germline, the GrkDeltaTC protein accumulates throughout the oocyte cytoplasm and cannot signal. In addition, we found that several strong gurken alleles contain point mutations in the transmembrane region. We conclude that secretion of Gurken requires its transmembrane region, and propose a model in which the gene cornichon mediates this process.",1999,"C Van Buskirk, T Schüpbach, G Barcelo, A M Queenan"
An essential role for the Drosophila Pax2 homolog in the differentiation of adult sensory organs,10207150,,"The adult peripheral nervous system of Drosophila includes a complex array of mechanosensory organs (bristles) that cover much of the body surface of the fly. The four cells (shaft, socket, sheath, and neuron) which compose each of these organs adopt distinct fates as a result of cell-cell signaling via the Notch (N) pathway. However, the specific mechanisms by which these cells execute their conferred fates are not well understood. Here we show that D-Pax2, the Drosophila homolog of the vertebrate Pax2 gene, has an essential role in the differentiation of the shaft cell. In flies bearing strong loss-of-function mutations in the shaven function of D-Pax2, shaft structures specifically fail to develop. Consistent with this, we find that D-Pax2 protein is expressed in all cells of the bristle lineage during the mitotic (cell fate specification) phase of bristle development, but becomes sharply restricted to the shaft and sheath cells in the post-mitotic (differentiative) phase. Two lines of evidence described here indicate that D-Pax2 expression and function is at least in part downstream of cell fate specification mechanisms such as N signaling. First, we find that the lack of late D-Pax2 expression in the socket cell (the sister of the shaft cell) is controlled by N pathway activity; second, we find that loss of D-Pax2 function is epistatic to the socket-to-shaft cell fate transformation caused by reduced N signaling. Finally, we show that misexpression of D-Pax2 is sufficient to induce the production of ectopic shaft structures. From these results, we propose that D-Pax2 is a high-level transcriptional regulator of the shaft cell differentiation program, and acts downstream of the N signaling pathway as a specific link between cell fate determination and cell differentiation in the bristle lineage.",1999,"W Fu, H Duan, J W Posakony, M Noll, J Kavaler"
Sexual behavior mutants revisited: molecular and cellular basis of Drosophila mating,11212311,10.1007/s000180050458,"The study of Drosophila melanogaster by a combination of forward genetics with specific mutants, and reverse genetics, in which a given gene is expressed in an appropriate brain area to test its effect on behavior, provides a unique opportunity to explore the causal relationship between a particular gene, its function in the cell and the behavioral outcome at the organismic level. Enhanced male-to-male courtship has been shown to occur as a result of mutations in several different genes. For example, the Voila mutant exhibits intense GAL4 reporter expression in the tarsal gustatory sensilla, suggesting the importance of tapping by a male on the female abdomen with his forelegs. Feminization of parts of the antennal lobe and mushroom body by targeted expression of a female-determining gene transformer+ (tra+) drives the male to court other males. Mutations in the tra target gene fruitless (fru), which is expressed in the antennal lobe as well as the suboesophageal ganglion (the gustatory inputs are processed here), also induce homosexual courtship in males. These results suggest that sensory inputs mediated and/or processed by the tarsal receptors, suboesophageal ganglion, antennal lobe and mushroom body contribute to the regulation of male-female courtship. Mosaic analysis localized the neural center for male courtship behavior to the posterior dorsal brain, in which the sensory information processed by the aforementioned neural structures may be integrated. Another mosaic study mapped the neural center for female sexual behavior, as measured by her receptiveness to copulation, to the anterior dorsal brain. The issue as to how the mutations that reduce female sexual receptiveness, e.g. dissatisfaction (dsf), spinster (spin) and chaste (cht), affect the structure and/or function of this neural center deserves to be addressed urgently.",1999,"D Yamamoto, Y Nakano"

We have characterized the Drosophila PTEN gene and present evidence that both inactivation and overexpression of PTEN affect cell size, while overexpression of PTEN also inhibits cell cycle progression at early mitosis and promotes cell death during eye development in a context-dependent manner. Furthermore, we have shown that PTEN acts in the insulin signaling pathway and all signals from the insulin receptor can be antagonized by either Drosophila or human PTEN, suggesting a potential means for alleviating symptoms associated with altered insulin signaling.",1999,"T Xu, E Hafen, H Sun, W Brogiolo, W Tao, D M Li, C J Potter, H Huang"
Transcript titers of ecdysteroid receptor components vary between tissues and stages during Drosophila development,10102573,,"In Drosophila, the ecdysteroids trigger the key regulatory cascades controlling the coordinated changes in the developmental pathway of molting and metamorphosis. Ecdysone action is mediated by a heterodimer consisting of the three ecdysone receptor (EcR) isoforms and the ultraspiracle proteins (USP). Heterodimers of these proteins bind to the ecdysone response element and ecdysone to modulate gene transcription. In this study, we developed a competitive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method to quantify the transcripts of functional ecdysone receptor components in individual tissues and for the whole body. The relatively small amount of variation in usp transcripts of the different tissues indicates that this gene does not perform a spatially restricted function in the late third instar wandering larvae while EcR isoforms were expressed in a more tissue-restricted pattern in the same stage. EcR-B1 was expressed at higher levels in larval tissues that are fated for histolysis, whereas EcR-A predominates in the imaginal discs. This result supports the hypothesis that a particular metamorphic response requires particular EcR isoforms. The transcript levels of the functional ecdysone receptor components fluctuate dramatically during development, suggesting that the regulations of the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels of these genes play some role in ecdysteroid response during Drosophila development.",1999,"J G Park, S J Kim, C C Lee"

Using the conserved DNA binding region of the Drosophila melanogaster ecdysone receptor (DmEcR) B1 cDNA as a probe, we isolated a medfly cDNA clone containing the coding region, a part of the 5'-untranslated region and the complete 3'-untranslated region of a CcEcR. The deduced CcEcR polypeptide contained all five domains typical of a nuclear receptor. Alignment comparisons and phylogenetic analyses indicated that CcEcR most closely resembled the B1 isoform of DmEcR and Lucilia cuprina EcR homolog (LcEcR) relative to all other known ecdysone receptors. In situ hybridization analysis showed that the CcEcR gene is mapped in the region 53B of the 4R chromosome arm, while Northern hybridization analysis showed that CcEcR transcripts have a size of approximately 8 kb. Significant levels of CcEcR transcripts were detected in eggs, middle and late embryos, late third instar larvae and middle prepupae. The levels of the CcEcR transcripts during the other larval stages as well as during pupal and adult stages were much lower, while during the early stages of embryogenesis were very low. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated that CcEcR binds specifically to the Drosophila hsp27 ecdysone response element as a heterodimer with Drosophila USP, the product of the ultraspiracle gene.

Genes to remember,10518471,,"It has been known for several decades that the formation of long-term memory requires gene expression.

The cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent activation pathway and a cAMP-dependent cascade of gene expression have been shown to be essential for memory formation in Aplysia californica, Drosophila melanogaster and rodents. Moreover, members of the transcription factor family cAMP response element binding proteins (CREBs) seem to represent key molecules for transforming incoming information into long-term memory.

Binuclear Drosophila oocytes: consequences and implications for dorsal-ventral patterning in oogenesis and embryogenesis,9927594,,"The position of the nucleus along the anterior rim of stage 8 Drosophila oocytes presages the dorsal side of the egg and the developing embryo. In this paper, we address the question of whether the oocyte has a previously determined dorsal side to which the nucleus is drawn, or whether nuclear position randomly determines the dorsal side. To do so, we have taken advantage of a genetic system in which Drosophila oocytes occasionally become binuclear. We find that (i) the two nuclei migrate independently to their respective positions on the anterior rim, sometimes selecting the same site, sometimes not, (ii) the two nuclei are equivalent in their ability to induce a dorsal-ventral pattern in the overlying follicular epithelium, and (iii) at any position around the anterior circumference of the egg chamber the follicle cell sheet is equally responsive to the Gurken signal associated with the oocyte nuclei. These results argue that the dorsal-ventral axis is determined arbitrarily by the randomly selected position of the nucleus on the anterior rim of the oocyte. Some of the binuclear eggs support embryonic development. However, despite the duplication of dorsal chorion structures, the majority of such embryos show normal dorsal-ventral patterning. Thus, processes exist in the ventral follicular epithelium or in the perivitelline space that compensate for the expansion of dorsal follicle cell fates and consequently allow the formation of a normal embryonic axis.",1999,"R Karess, P Jordan, S Roth"

The objective of this study was to test whether LOH of human PTC on chromosome 9q22 could be detected in archival sporadic BCCs.

Plasticity within the lateral somatic mesoderm of Drosophila embryos,10610031,,"Each of 30 Drosophila larval somatic muscles has its individual shape, insertion sites and innervation. From the very beginning, the formation of individual muscles is controlled by a set of muscle identity genes. The four lateral transverse muscles (LT1-LT4) are thought to be specified by the combinatorial activity of Krüppel (Kr), apterous (ap) and muscle specific homeobox (msh) genes whilst the activity of the ladybird (lb) genes is required for proper formation of the neighbouring segmental border muscle (SBM). We have recently shown that ectopic expression of lb changes the identity of Kr-expressing lateral muscle precursors and recruits them to form enlarged or duplicated SBMs. Here we report that loss of msh function leads to a similar transformation resulting in the overproduction of SBMs. Inversely, in msh gain of function embryos, the prospective SBM myoblasts change their identity resulting in the formation of enlarged lateral transverse muscles. These data indicate a key role for the msh and lb genes in the specification and diversification of myoblast lineages from the lateral domain, and reveal a plasticity of cell fate within the somatic mesoderm of Drosophila.",1999,"T Jagla, J L Vonesch, M Bellard, F Bellard, B Dastugue, K Jagla"
Messenger RNA-binding properties of nonpolysomal ribonucleoproteins from heat-stressed tomato cells,10318680,10.1104/pp.120.1.23,"Most cells experiencing heat stress reprogram their translational machinery to favor the synthesis of heat-stress proteins. Translation of other transcripts is almost completely repressed, but most untranslated messengers are not degraded. In contrast to yeast, Drosophila melanogaster, and HeLa cells, plant cells store repressed messengers in cytoplasmic nonpolysomal ribonucleoproteins (RNPs). To follow the fate of untranslated transcripts, we studied protein composition, mRNA content, and RNA-binding properties of nonpolysomal RNPs from heat-stressed tomato (Lycopersicon peruvianum) cells. Contrary to the selective interaction in vivo, RNPs isolated from tomato cells bound both stress-induced and repressed messengers, suggesting that the selection mechanism resides elsewhere. This binding was independent of a cap or a poly(A) tail. The possible role of proteasomes and heat-stress granules (HSGs) in mRNA storage is a topic of debate. We found in vitro messenger-RNA-binding activity in messenger RNP fractions free of C2-subunit-containing proteasomes and HSGs.

Consistent with this notion, the Ttk69 protein, but not Ttk88, is expressed in all photoreceptor cells during pupal stage. Thus, Ttk69 appears to play a dual function by serving negative and positive regulatory roles at different stages of photoreceptor development.",1999,"Y Li, Z C Lai"
"Diapause-associated transcription of BmEts, a gene encoding an ETS transcription factor homolog in Bombyx mori",10333573,10.1016/s0965-1748(99)00008-9,"To understand the molecular mechanism of diapause determination in early embryogenesis of the silkworm, Bombyx mori, mRNA from diapause and non-diapause eggs was compared using the differential display technique. A 1.2 kbp differentially amplified cDNA fragment was cloned and sequenced. Northern blot analysis confirmed that the mRNA corresponding to this clone, D1, was specifically induced in diapause eggs from 20 h after oviposition, and decreased gradually but was clearly detectable until 40 days after oviposition. On the other hand, if diapause eggs were activated by HCl treatment 20 h after oviposition, the mRNA corresponding to D1 vanished 72 h after HCl treatment. In pnd (pigmented and non-diapausing egg) homozygous embryos, which never enter into diapause, the RNA was not transcribed at any stage, whereas, in pnd-2 homozygous embryos which also have no diapause, similar results were obtained to those for HCl treated eggs. The deduced amino acid sequence of D1 was most highly related to the identified Drosophila and vertebrate ETS proteins, within the approximately 85 amino acid ETS domain. ETS proteins play an important role in transcription activation during a variety of biological processes and can be grouped into sub-families, based on sequence similarity in the ETS domain which has been shown to be a DNA-binding domain. Therefore, we have called the gene corresponding to D1 BmEts. These observations suggest that BmEts encodes a novel ETS family member which is strongly associated with the embryonic diapause. Moreover, BmEts probably acts downstream of the pnd gene in the regulatory hierarchy of diapause determination, alternatively BmEts itself might be the pnd gene.",1999,"T Shimada, M G Suzuki, T Terada, M Kobayashi"
Functional analysis of CNK in RAS signaling,10557308,10.1073/pnas.96.23.13259,"Connector enhancer of KSR (CNK) is a multidomain protein required for RAS signaling. Its C-terminal portion (CNK(C-term)) directly binds to RAF. Herein, we show that the N-terminal portion of CNK (CNK(N-term)) strongly cooperates with RAS, whereas CNK(C-term) efficiently blocks RAS- and RAF-dependent signaling when overexpressed in the Drosophila eye. Two effector loop mutants of RAS(V12), S35 and C40, which selectively activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase pathways, respectively, do not cooperate with CNK. However, a strong cooperation is observed between CNK and RAS(V12G37), an effector loop mutant known in mammals to activate specifically the RAL pathway. We have identified two domains in CNK(N-term) that are critical for cooperation with RAS. Our results suggest that CNK functions in more than one pathway downstream of RAS. CNK(c-term) seems to regulate RAF, a component of the MAPK pathway, whereas CNK(N-term) seems to be involved in a MAPK-independent pathway.",1999,"G M Rubin, M Therrien, A M Wong, E Kwan"
Drosophila center divider gene is expressed in CNS midline cells and encodes a developmentally regulated protein kinase orthologous to human TESK1,10390152,10.1089/104454999315150,"The Drosophila center divider gene (cdi) was isolated in an enhancer trap screen undertaken to identify genes involved in embryonic central nervous system (CNS) midline cell development. Three independent lines with P-element insertions at 91F were analyzed that all showed prominent beta-galactosidase expression in the CNS midline precursor cells and other cell types. Null mutations were created by imprecise P-element excision and shown to be larval lethal, although no severe CNS defects were observed in mutant embryos. The DNA surrounding the sites of insertion was cloned and found to contain a transcription unit that was dynamically expressed in a pattern corresponding to the enhancer trap line beta-galactosidase expression. Sequencing of cDNA clones revealed that the cdi gene encodes a 1140-amino acid protein that is an ortholog of the mammalian testis-specific TESK1 protein kinase. This serine/threonine kinase is distinct from other protein kinases because of sequence differences in the residues conferring substrate specificity. The unique sequence is conserved in Cdi, suggesting that Cdi/TESK1 represents a novel class of signaling proteins.",1999,"S T Crews, B B Matthews"

The function of specific morphogenetic genes in the lung are now placed in context with pattern-forming functions in other, better understood morphogenetic fields such as the limb bud. Initiation of lung morphogenesis from the floor of the primitive foregut requires coordinated transcriptional activation and repression involving hepatocyte nuclear factor-3beta, Sonic hedgehog, patched, Gli2, and Gli3 as well as Nkx2.1. Subsequent inductive events require epithelial-mesenchymal interaction mediated by specific fibroblast growth factor ligand-receptor signaling as well as modulation by other peptide growth factors including epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor-A and transforming growth factor-beta and by extracellular matrix components.

Mushroom body ablation impairs short-term memory and long-term memory of courtship conditioning in Drosophila melanogaster,10624959,10.1016/s0896-6273(00)81043-0,"We have evaluated the role of the Drosophila mushroom bodies (MBs) in courtship conditioning, in which experience with mated females causes males to reduce their courtship toward virgins (Siegel and Hall, 1979). Whereas previous studies indicated that MB ablation abolished learning in an olfactory conditioning paradigm (deBelle and Heisenberg, 1994), MB-ablated males were able to learn in the courtship paradigm. They resumed courting at naive levels within 30 min after training, however, while the courtship of control males remained depressed 1 hr after training. We also describe a novel courtship conditioning paradigm that established long-term memory, lasting 9 days. In MB-ablated males, memory dissipated completely within 1 day. Our results indicate that the MBs are not required for learning and immediate recall of courtship conditioning but are required for consolidation of short-term and long-term associative memories.",1999,"G Baker, S M McBride, K Watson, K K Siwicki, P Krause, C Choi, G Giuliani, D Correale"

The hearts of adults and early pupae both consist of a tube of circular striated muscle one cell in thickness. The alary muscles, which suspend the heart, are more delicate in the adult compared to the early pupa. The pericardial cells in both early pupae and adults are connected to the heart by connective tissue radiating from the alary muscles or dorsal diaphragm. We confirm that four major changes occur in the heart during metamorphosis: 1) a conical chamber is formed de novo in the first and second abdominal segments; 2) the adult heart curves to conform to the contour of the abdomen; 3) a layer of longitudinal striated muscle appears on the ventral surface of the heart; 4) a fourth pair of ostia is added to the three already present in the early pupa; and note additionally that 5) the ostia appear as simple openings in the heart of the early pupa but are valve-like in the adult.",1999,"J M Ringo, H B Dowse, N J Curtis"
Molecular and functional characterization of a novel mouse transient receptor potential protein homologue TRP7. Ca(2+)-permeable cation channel that is constitutively activated and enhanced by stimulation of G protein-coupled receptor,10488066,10.1074/jbc.274.39.27359,"Characterization of mammalian homologues of Drosophila transient receptor potential protein (TRP) is an important clue to understand molecular mechanisms underlying Ca(2+) influx activated in response to stimulation of G(q) protein-coupled receptors in vertebrate cells. Here we have isolated cDNA encoding a novel seventh mammalian TRP homologue, TRP7, from mouse brain. TRP7 showed abundant RNA expression in the heart, lung, and eye and moderate expression in the brain, spleen, and testis. TRP7 recombinantly expressed in human embryonic kidney cells exhibited distinctive functional features, compared with other TRP homologues. Basal influx activity accompanied by reduction in Ca(2+) release from internal stores was characteristic of TRP7-expressing cells but was by far less significant in cells expressing TRP3, which is structurally the closest to TRP7 in the TRP family. TRP7 induced Ca(2+) influx in response to ATP receptor stimulation at ATP concentrations lower than those necessary for activation of TRP3 and for Ca(2+) release from the intracellular store, which suggests that the TRP7 channel is activated independently of Ca(2+) release. In fact, TRP7 expression did not affect capacitative Ca(2+) entry induced by thapsigargin, whereas TRP7 greatly potentiated Mn(2+) influx induced by diacylglycerols without involvement of protein kinase C. Nystatin-perforated and conventional whole-cell patch clamp recordings from TRP7-expressing cells demonstrated the constitutively activated and ATP-enhanced inward cation currents, both of which were initially blocked and then subsequently facilitated by extracellular Ca(2+) at a physiological concentration. Impairment of TRP7 currents by internal perfusion of the Ca(2+) chelator 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid revealed an essential role of intracellular Ca(2+) in activation of TRP7, and their potent activation by the diacylglycerol analogue suggests that the TRP7 channel is a new member of diacylglycerol-activated cation channels. Relative permeabilities indicate that TRP7 is slightly selective to divalent cations. Thus, our findings reveal an interesting correspondence of TRP7 to the background and receptor stimulation-induced cation currents in various native systems.",1999,"I Tanaka, T Yamakuni, A Maeda, T Kurosaki, S Shimizu, K Imoto, Y Mori, T Okada, K Ikenaka, R Inoue, K Yamazaki"
Differential and inefficient splicing of a broadly expressed Drosophila erect wing transcript results in tissue-specific enrichment of the vital EWG protein isoform,10330140,10.1128/mcb.19.6.3998,"In this report, we document an unusual mode of tissue-enriched gene expression that is primarily mediated by alternative and inefficient splicing. We have analyzed posttranscriptional regulation of the Drosophila erect wing gene, which provides a vital neuronal function and is essential for the formation of certain muscles. Its predominant protein product, the 116-kDa EWG protein, a putative transcriptional regulator, can provide all known erect wing-associated functions. Moreover, consistent with its function, the 116-kDa protein is highly enriched in neurons and is also observed transiently in migrating myoblasts. In contrast to the protein distribution, we observed that erect wing transcripts are present in comparable levels in neuron-enriched heads and neuron-poor bodies of adult Drosophila. Our analyses shows that erect wing transcript consists of 10 exons and is alternatively spliced and that a subset of introns are inefficiently spliced. We also show that the 116-kDa EWG protein-encoding splice isoform is head enriched. In contrast, bodies have lower levels of transcripts that can encode the 116-kDa protein and greater amounts of unprocessed erect wing RNA. Thus, the enrichment of the 116-kDa protein in heads is ensured by tissue-specific alternative and inefficient splicing and not by transcriptional regulation. Furthermore, this regulation is biologically important, as an increased level of the 116-kDa protein outside the nervous system is lethal.",1999,"D M Daub, S P Koushika, M Soller, S M DeSimone, K White"

We find that all eukaryotic N-glycoproteomes have invariant characteristics including sequence recognition patterns, structural constraints, and subcellular localization. However, a surprisingly large percentage of the N-glycoproteome evolved after the phylogenetic divergences between plants, fungi, nematodes, insects, and vertebrates.

COPI-mediated membrane trafficking is required for cytokinesis in Drosophila male meiotic divisions,22553212,10.1242/jcs.103317,"The coatomer protein complex, COPI, mediates retrograde vesicle transport from the Golgi apparatus to the ER. Here, we investigated the meiotic phenotype of Drosophila melanogaster spermatocytes expressing dsRNA of 52 genes encoding membrane-trafficking-related factors. We identified COPI as an essential factor for male meiosis. In Drosophila male meiotic divisions, COPI is localized in the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment of tER-Golgi units scattered throughout the spermatocyte cytoplasm. Prior to chromosome segregation, the vesicles assemble at the spindle pole periphery through a poleward movement, mediated by minus-end motor dynein along astral microtubules. At the end of each meiotic division, COPI-containing vesicles are equally partitioned between two daughter cells. Our present data strongly suggest that spermatocytes possess a regulatory mechanism for equal inheritance of several types of membrane vesicles. Using testis-specific knockdown of COPI subunits or the small GTPase Arf or mutations of the γCOP gene, we examined the role of COPI in male meiosis. COPI depletion resulted in the failure of cytokinesis, through disrupted accumulation of essential proteins and lipid components at the cleavage furrow region. Furthermore, it caused a reduction in the number of overlapping central spindle microtubules, which are essential for cytokinesis. Drosophila spermatocytes construct ER-based intracellular structures associated with astral and spindle microtubules. COPI depletion resulted in severe disruption of these ER-based structures. Thus, we propose that COPI plays an important role in Drosophila male meiosis, not only through vesicle transport to the cleavage furrow region, but also through the formation of ER-based structures.",2012,"Yoshihiro H Inoue, Masamitsu Yamaguchi, Hajime Mori, Daishi Kitazawa"
The Protonation States of the Active-Site Histidines in (6-4) Photolyase,26593369,10.1021/ct2005648,"The active sites of the (6-4) photolyases contain two conserved histidine residues, which, in the Drosophila melanogaster enzyme, correspond to His365 and His369. While there are nine combinations in which the three possible protonation states of the two histidines (with protons on Nδ (HID), Nε (HIE), or both Nδ and Nε (HIP)) can be paired, there is presently no consensus as to which of these states is present, let alone mechanistically relevant. EPR hyperfine couplings for selected protons of the FADH(•) radical have previously been used to address this issue. Our QM/MM calculations show, however, that the experimental couplings are equally well reproduced by each of the nine combinations. Since the EPR results seemingly cannot be used to unequivocally assign the protonation states, the pKa values of the two histidines were calculated using the popular PROPKA, H++, and APBS approaches, in various environments and for several lesions. These techniques consistently indicate that, at pH = 7, both His365 and His369 should be neutral, although His369 is found to be more prone to becoming protonated. In a comparative approach, a series of molecular dynamics simulations was performed with all nine combinations, employing various reference crystal structures and different oxidation states of the FAD cofactor. The overall result of this approach is in agreement with our pKa results. Consequently, although the introduction of the reduced cofactor results in an increased stability for selected protonated states, particularly the His365═HID and His369═HIP combination, the neutral combination His365═HID and His365═HIE stands out as the most relevant state for the activity of the enzyme.",2012,"Ana-Sunčana Smith, David M Smith, Karmen Condic-Jurkic, Hendrik Zipse"
Evolution of genome content: population dynamics of transposable elements in flies and humans,22407716,10.1007/978-1-61779-582-4_13,"Recent research is starting to shed light on the factors that influence the population and evolutionary dynamics of transposable elements (TEs) and TE life cycles. Genomes differ sharply in the number of TE copies, in the level of TE activity, in the diversity of TE families and types, and in the proportion of old and young TEs. In this chapter, we focus on two well-studied genomes with strikingly different architectures, humans and Drosophila, which represent two extremes in terms of TE diversity and population dynamics. We argue that some of the answers might lie in (1) the larger population size and consequently more effective selection against new TE insertions due to ectopic recombination in flies compared to humans; and (2) in the faster rate of DNA loss in flies compared to humans leading to much faster removal of fixed TE copies from the fly genome.",2012,"Josefa González, Dmitri A Petrov"
mRNA cycles through hypoxia-induced stress granules in live Drosophila embryonic muscles,23319346,10.1387/ijdb.103172al,"In some myopathies, hypoxia can be the result of pathologic effects like muscle necrosis and abnormal blood flow. At the molecular level, the consequence of hypoxic conditions is not yet fully understood. Under stress conditions, many housekeeping gene mRNAs are translationally silenced, while translation of other mRNAs increases. Alterations to the pool of mRNAs available for translation lead to the formation of so-called stress granules containing both mRNAs and proteins. Stress granule formation and dynamics have been investigated using cells in culture, but have not yet been examined in vivo. In Drosophila embryonic muscles, we found that hypoxia induces the formation of sarcoplasmic granules containing the established stress granule markers RIN and dFMR1. Upon restoration of normoxia, the observed granules were decreased in size, indicating that their formation might be reversible. Employing photobleaching approaches, we found that a cytoplasmic reporter mRNA rapidly shuttles in and out of the granules. Hence, stress granules are highly dynamic complexes and not simple temporary storage sites. Although mRNA rapidly cycles through the granules, its movement throughout the muscle is, remarkably, spatially restricted by the presence of yet undefined myofiber domains. Our results suggest that in hypoxic muscles mRNA remains highly mobile; however, its movement throughout the muscle is restricted by certain boundaries. The development of this Drosophila hypoxia model makes it possible to study the formation and dynamics of stress granules and their associated mRNAs and proteins in a living organism.",2012,"Roeland W Dirks, Hans J Tanke, Carolina R Jost, Annelies M A van der Laan, Jasprina N Noordermeer, Alice M C van Gemert, Lee G Fradkin"

In addition to being palmitoylated, Hh is the only metazoan protein known to possess a covalently-linked cholesterol moiety. The absence of either modification severely disrupts the organization of numerous tissues during development. It is currently not known how lipid-modified Hh is secreted and released from producing cells. We have performed a genome-wide RNAi screen in Drosophila melanogaster cells to identify regulators of Hh secretion. We found that cholesterol-modified Hh secretion is strongly dependent on coat protein complex I (COPI) but not COPII vesicles, suggesting that cholesterol modification alters the movement of Hh through the early secretory pathway. We provide evidence that both proteolysis and cholesterol modification are necessary for the efficient trafficking of Hh through the ER and Golgi. Finally, we identified several putative regulators of protein secretion and demonstrate a role for some of these genes in Hh and Wingless (Wg) morphogen secretion in vivo. These data open new perspectives for studying how morphogen secretion is regulated, as well as provide insight into regulation of lipid-modified protein secretion.",2012,"Laurent Ruel, Sébastien Schaub, Sandra Lacas-Gervais, Gisela D'Angelo, Alexandra Cervantes, Pascal Thérond, Reid Aikin"
The human HECA interacts with cyclins and CDKs to antagonize Wnt-mediated proliferation and chemoresistance of head and neck cancer cells,22100912,10.1016/j.yexcr.2011.11.004,"There is a growing evidence that the human homologue of the Drosophila headcase (HECA) plays an important role in human carcinogenesis. So far specific protein interaction partners and affected signaling pathways of HECA are still elusive. In a recent study we showed that HECA overexpression in oral squamous-cell carcinoma (OSCC) keratinocytes has tumor suppressive effects resulting in a recuperation of cell cycle control concerning the entry and progression of S-phase, G2- and M-phase. Currently, quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemical analysis of primary tumor tissue from OSCC patients demonstrate that HECA expression is markedly decreased compared to normal control patients with abundant HECA expression. Additionally, there is nearly no HECA expression in OSCC metastases. Here, we show that HECA expression is negatively controlled by the Wnt-pathway and TCF4, a Wnt related transcription factor, binds to the HECA promoter. Furthermore, immunocytochemistry reveals colocalization of HECA with the cyclin dependent kinase CDK9. Immunoprecipitation experiments and proximity ligation assays further reveal an interaction of HECA with CDK2, CDK9, Cyclin A and Cyclin K, a direct transcriptional target of the p53 tumor suppressor. Silencing HECA in OSCC cell lines leads to a significant increase of cell division and a markedly increased resistance against the chemotherapeutic cisplatin. On the contrary, HECA overexpressing OSCC cell lines show decreased resistance of OSCC cells against cisplatin. Therefore, HECA could be considered as future therapeutic agent against Wnt-dependent tumor progression.",2012,"Albert Dowejko, Karin Bauer, Richard Bauer, Urs D A Müller-Richter, Torsten E Reichert"
Evolution and function of the extended miR-2 microRNA family,22336713,10.4161/rna.19160,"MicroRNAs are essential post-transcriptional regulators. Many animal microRNAs are clustered in the genome, and it has been shown that clustered microRNAs may be transcribed as a single transcript. Polycistronic microRNAs are often members of the same family, suggesting a role of tandem duplication in the emergence of clusters. The mir-2 microRNA family is the largest in Drosophila melanogaster, with 8 members that are mostly clustered in the genome. Previous studies suggest that the copy number and genomic distribution of mir-2 family members has been subject to significant change during evolution. The effects of such changes on their function are still unknown. Here we study the evolution of function in the mir-2 family. Our analyses show that, in spite of the change in number and organization among invertebrates, most mir-2 loci produce very similar mature microRNA products. Multiple mature miR-2 sequences are predicted to target genes involved in neural development in Drosophila. These targeting properties are conserved in the distant species Caenorhabditis elegans. Duplication followed by functional diversification is frequent during protein-coding gene evolution. However, our results suggest that the production of microRNA clusters by gene duplication rarely involves functional changes. This pattern of functional redundancy among clustered paralogous microRNAs reflects birth-and-death evolutionary dynamics. However, we identified a small number of mir-2 sequences in Drosophila that may have undergone functional shifts associated with genomic rearrangements. Therefore, redundancy in microRNA families may facilitate the acquisition of novel functional features.",2012,"Sam Griffiths-Jones, Katarzyna Hooks, Antonio Marco"

New insights into the ecological interaction between grape berry microorganisms and Drosophila flies during the development of sour rot,22438040,10.1007/s00248-012-0041-y,"In this work, we studied the ecological interactions between grape berry microorganisms and Drosophila sp. flies involved in sour rot disease during grape ripening. After veráison the total microbial counts of grape berries affected by sour rot increased from about 2 log CFU/g of berries to more than 7 log CFU/g. Berry damage provoked a clear shift in yeast diversity from basidiomycetes to ascomycetous fermentative species. The latter were mostly Pichia terricola, Hanseniaspora uvarum, Candida zemplinina, and Zygoascus hellenicus. However, these species were not able to produce the metabolites characteristic of sour rot (gluconic and acetic acids) in inoculated berries. On the contrary, the acetic acid bacteria Gluconacetobacter saccharivorans produced high levels of these acids, mainly when berries were incubated in the presence of the insect Drosophila sp. Sour rot was not observed when grape bunches were physically separated from insects, even when berries were artificially injured. The wounds made in berry skin healed in the absence of insects, thus preventing the development of sour rot. Therefore, in the vineyard, the induction of sour rot depends on the contamination of wounded berries by a microbial consortium--yeasts and acetic acid bacteria--transported by drosophilid insects which disseminate sour rot among damaged berries. In the absence of these insects, plant defense mechanisms are effective and lead to skin healing, preventing disease spread. Thus, we showed that Drosophila sp. act as a vector for microorganisms associated with grape sour rot disease.",2012,"Virgílio Loureiro, Sara Correia Santos, Manuel Malfeito-Ferreira, André Barata"
Rhodiola rosea extracts and salidroside decrease the growth of bladder cancer cell lines via inhibition of the mTOR pathway and induction of autophagy,21520297,10.1002/mc.20780,"The incidence of human urinary bladder cancer increases markedly with age, suggesting a mechanistic connection between aging and bladder carcinogenesis and a potential use of anti-aging agents in bladder cancer chemoprevention. Rhodiola rosea, growing in high altitude or cold regions of the world, has been reported to have anti-aging effects in Drosophila. We demonstrated that a R. rosea extract and one of its bioactive components, salidroside, inhibited the growth of bladder cancer cell lines with a minimal effect on nonmalignant bladder epithelial cells TEU-2. Interestingly, the R. rosea extract and salidroside component exhibited a selective ability to inhibit the growth of p53 knockout primary mouse embryo fibroblasts (p53-/- MEFs) compared to their wild-type counterparts. The growth inhibitory effects of the R. rosea extract and salidroside were, however, attenuated in TSC2 and p53 double knock MEFs (TSC2-/-, p53-/- MEFs), suggesting that TSC2 protein is, at least in part, required for the growth inhibitory effects of the R. rosea extract and salidroside. The R. rosea extract and salidroside treatment of UMUC3 cells resulted in an increase of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-α phosphorylation and a decrease of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, leading to increased binding of 4E-BP1 to m7 GTP. These results indicate that the R. rosea extract and salidroside inhibit translation initiation.

A dp53/JNK-dependant feedback amplification loop is essential for the apoptotic response to stress in Drosophila,21886179,10.1038/cdd.2011.113,"Programmed cell death (apoptosis) is a conserved process aimed to eliminate unwanted cells. The key molecules are a group of proteases called caspases that cleave vital proteins, which leads to the death of cells. In Drosophila, the apoptotic pathway is usually represented as a cascade of events in which an initial stimulus activates one or more of the proapoptotic genes (hid, rpr, grim), which in turn activate caspases. In stress-induced apoptosis, the dp53 (Drosophila p53) gene and the Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway function upstream in the activation of the proapoptotic genes. Here we demonstrate that dp53 and JNK also function downstream of proapoptotic genes and the initiator caspase Dronc (Drosophila NEDD2-like caspase) and that they establish a feedback loop that amplifies the initial apoptotic stimulus. This loop plays a critical role in the apoptotic response because in its absence there is a dramatic decrease in the amount of cell death after a pulse of the proapoptotic proteins Hid and Rpr. Thus, our results indicate that stress-induced apoptosis in Drosophila is dependant on an amplification loop mediated by dp53 and JNK. Furthermore, they also demonstrate a mechanism of mutual activation of proapoptotic genes.",2012,"E Shlevkov, G Morata"
XIAP monoubiquitylates Groucho/TLE to promote canonical Wnt signaling,22304967,10.1016/j.molcel.2011.12.032,"A key event in Wnt signaling is conversion of TCF/Lef from a transcriptional repressor to an activator, yet how this switch occurs is not well understood. Here, we report an unanticipated role for X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) in regulating this critical Wnt signaling event that is independent of its antiapoptotic function. We identified DIAP1 as a positive regulator of Wingless signaling in a Drosophila S2 cell-based RNAi screen. XIAP, its vertebrate homolog, is similarly required for Wnt signaling in cultured mammalian cells and in Xenopus embryos, indicating evolutionary conservation of function. Upon Wnt pathway activation, XIAP is recruited to TCF/Lef where it monoubiquitylates Groucho (Gro)/TLE. This modification decreases affinity of Gro/TLE for TCF/Lef. Our data reveal a transcriptional switch involving XIAP-mediated ubiquitylation of Gro/TLE that facilitates its removal from TCF/Lef, thus allowing β-catenin-TCF/Lef complex assembly and initiation of a Wnt-specific transcriptional program.",2012,"Tanner J Freeman, Heather A Wallace, Ethan Lee, Laura A Lee, Alison J Hanson, R Daniel Beauchamp"
Deep sequencing and expression of microRNAs from early honeybee (Apis mellifera) embryos reveals a role in regulating early embryonic patterning,23121997,10.1186/1471-2148-12-211,"Background: Recent evidence supports the proposal that the observed diversity of animal body plans has been produced through alterations to the complexity of the regulatory genome rather than increases in the protein-coding content of a genome. One significant form of gene regulation is the contribution made by the non-coding content of the genome. Non-coding RNAs play roles in embryonic development of animals and these functions might be expected to evolve rapidly. Using next-generation sequencing and in situ hybridization, we have examined the miRNA content of early honeybee embryos. Results: Through small RNA sequencing we found that 28% of known miRNAs are expressed in the early embryo. We also identified developmentally expressed microRNAs that are unique to the Apoidea clade. Examination of expression patterns implied these miRNAs have roles in patterning the anterior-posterior and dorso-ventral axes as well as the extraembryonic membranes. Knockdown of Dicer, a key component of miRNA processing, confirmed that miRNAs are likely to have a role in patterning these tissues. Conclusions: Examination of the expression patterns of novel miRNAs, some unique to the Apis group, indicated that they are likely to play a role in early honeybee development. Known miRNAs that are deeply conserved in animal phyla display differences in expression pattern between honeybee and Drosophila, particularly at early stages of development. This may indicate miRNAs play a rapidly evolving role in regulating developmental pathways, most likely through changes to the way their expression is regulated.",2012,"Megan J Wilson, Peter K Dearden, Lisa Zondag"
"Control of germline stem cell division frequency--a novel, developmentally regulated role for epidermal growth factor signaling",22586473,10.1371/journal.pone.0036460,"Exploring adult stem cell dynamics in normal and disease states is crucial to both better understanding their in vivo role and better realizing their therapeutic potential. Here we address the division frequency of Germline Stem Cells (GSCs) in testes of Drosophila melanogaster. We show that GSC division frequency is under genetic control of the highly conserved Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) signaling pathway. When EGF signaling was attenuated, we detected a two-fold increase in the percentage of GSCs in mitotic division compared to GSCs in control animals. Ex vivo and in vivo experiments using a marker for cells in S-phase of the cell cycle showed that the GSCs in EGF mutant testes divide faster than GSCs in control testes. The increased mitotic activity of GSCs in EGF mutants was rescued by restoring EGF signaling in the GSCs, and reproduced in testes from animals with soma-depleted EGF-Receptor (EGFR). Interestingly, EGF attenuation specifically increased the GSC division frequency in adult testes, but not in larval testes. Furthermore, GSCs in testes with tumors resulting from the perturbation of other conserved signaling pathways divided at normal frequencies. We conclude that EGF signaling from the GSCs to the CySCs normally regulates GSC division frequency. The EGF signaling pathway is bifurcated and acts differently in adult compared to larval testes. In addition, regulation of GSC division frequency is a specific role for EGF signaling as it is not affected in all tumor models. These data advance our understanding concerning stem cell dynamics in normal tissues and in a tumor model.",2012,"Alicia Hudson, Regina Brady, Cordula Schulz, Benjamin B Parrott"
Peroxidasin forms sulfilimine chemical bonds using hypohalous acids in tissue genesis,22842973,10.1038/nchembio.1038,"Collagen IV comprises the predominant protein network of basement membranes, a specialized extracellular matrix, which underlie epithelia and endothelia. These networks assemble through oligomerization and covalent crosslinking to endow mechanical strength and shape cell behavior through interactions with cell-surface receptors. A recently discovered sulfilimine (S=N) bond between a methionine sulfur and hydroxylysine nitrogen reinforces the collagen IV network. We demonstrate that peroxidasin, an enzyme found in basement membranes, catalyzes formation of the sulfilimine bond. Drosophila peroxidasin mutants have disorganized collagen IV networks and torn visceral muscle basement membranes, pointing to a critical role for the enzyme in tissue biogenesis. Peroxidasin generates hypohalous acids as reaction intermediates, suggesting a paradoxically anabolic role for these usually destructive oxidants.

Evidence that the spindle assembly checkpoint does not regulate APC(Fzy) activity in Drosophila female meiosis,22196012,10.1139/g11-079,"The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) plays an important role in mitotic cells to sense improper chromosome attachment to spindle microtubules and to inhibit APC(Fzy)-dependent destruction of cyclin B and Securin; consequent initiation of anaphase until correct attachments are made. In Drosophila , SAC genes have been found to play a role in ensuring proper chromosome segregation in meiosis, possibly reflecting a similar role for the SAC in APC(Fzy) inhibition during meiosis. We found that loss of function mutations in SAC genes, Mad2, zwilch, and mps1, do not lead to the predicted rise in APC(Fzy)-dependent degradation of cyclin B either globally throughout the egg or locally on the meiotic spindle. Further, the SAC is not responsible for the inability of APC(Fzy) to target cyclin B and promote anaphase in metaphase II arrested eggs from cort mutant females. Our findings support the argument that SAC proteins play checkpoint independent roles in Drosophila female meiosis and that other mechanisms must function to control APC activity.",2012,"Andrew Swan, Osamah Batiha"
Three-dimensional motor neuron morphology estimation in the Drosophila ventral nerve cord,22203698,10.1109/TBME.2011.2181166,"Type-specific dendritic arborization patterns dictate synaptic connectivity and are fundamental determinants of neuronal function. We exploit the morphological stereotypy and relative simplicity of the Drosophila nervous system to model the diverse neuronal morphologies of individual motor neurons (MNs) and understand underlying principles of synaptic connectivity in a motor circuit. Our computational approach aims at the reconstruction of the neuron morphology, namely the robust segmentation of the neuron volumes from their surroundings with the simultaneous partitioning into their compartments, namely the soma, axon, and dendrites. We use the idea of cosegmentation, where every image along the z -axis (depth) is segmented using information from ""neighboring"" depths. We use 3-D Haar-like features to model appearance. Because soma and axon are determined by their distinctive shapes, we define an implicit shape representation of the 2-D segmentation sets to drive cosegmentation and achieve the desired partitioning. We validate our method using image stacks depicting single neurons labeled with green fluorescent protein (GFP) and serially imaged with laser scanning confocal microscopy.",2012,"Prateep Mukherjee, Akira Chiba, Gavriil Tsechpenakis, Michael D Kim"
Impact of the resident microbiota on the nutritional phenotype of Drosophila melanogaster,22586494,10.1371/journal.pone.0036765,"Background: Animals are chronically infected by benign and beneficial microorganisms that generally promote animal health through their effects on the nutrition, immune function and other physiological systems of the host. Insight into the host-microbial interactions can be obtained by comparing the traits of animals experimentally deprived of their microbiota and untreated animals. Drosophila melanogaster is an experimentally tractable system to study host-microbial interactions. Methodology/principal findings: The nutritional significance of the microbiota was investigated in D. melanogaster bearing unmanipulated microbiota, demonstrated by 454 sequencing of 16S rRNA amplicons to be dominated by the α-proteobacterium Acetobacter, and experimentally deprived of the microbiota by egg dechorionation (conventional and axenic flies, respectively). In axenic flies, larval development rate was depressed with no effect on adult size relative to conventional flies, indicating that the microbiota promotes larval growth rates. Female fecundity did not differ significantly between conventional and axenic flies, but axenic flies had significantly reduced metabolic rate and altered carbohydrate allocation, including elevated glucose levels. Conclusions/significance: We have shown that elimination of the resident microbiota extends larval development and perturbs energy homeostasis and carbohydrate allocation patterns of of D. melanogaster.

To study the genetic architecture of F(1) hybrid sterility between young subspecies of house mouse Mus m. domesticus and M. m. musculus, we conducted QTL analysis of a backcross between inbred strains representing these two subspecies and probed the role of individual chromosomes in hybrid sterility using the intersubspecific chromosome substitution strains. We provide direct evidence that the asymmetry in male infertility between reciprocal crosses is conferred by the middle region of M. m. musculus Chr X, thus excluding other potential candidates such as Y, imprinted genes, and mitochondrial DNA. QTL analysis identified strong hybrid sterility loci on Chr 17 and Chr X and predicted a set of interchangeable autosomal loci, a subset of which is sufficient to activate the Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibility of the strong loci. Overall, our results indicate the oligogenic nature of F(1) hybrid sterility, which should be amenable to reconstruction by proper combination of chromosome substitution strains.

Tao controls epithelial morphogenesis by promoting Fasciclin 2 endocytosis,23266957,10.1083/jcb.201207150,"Regulation of epithelial cell shape, for example, changes in relative sizes of apical, basal, and lateral membranes, is a key mechanism driving morphogenesis. However, it is unclear how epithelial cells control the size of their membranes. In the epithelium of the Drosophila melanogaster ovary, cuboidal precursor cells transform into a squamous epithelium through a process that involves lateral membrane shortening coupled to apical membrane extension. In this paper, we report a mutation in the gene Tao, which resulted in the loss of this cuboidal to squamous transition. We show that the inability of Tao mutant cells to shorten their membranes was caused by the accumulation of the cell adhesion molecule Fasciclin 2, the Drosophila N-CAM (neural cell adhesion molecule) homologue. Fasciclin 2 accumulation at the lateral membrane of Tao mutant cells prevented membrane shrinking and thereby inhibited morphogenesis. In wild-type cells, Tao initiated morphogenesis by promoting Fasciclin 2 endocytosis at the lateral membrane. Thus, we identify here a mechanism controlling the morphogenesis of a squamous epithelium.",2012,"Veit Riechmann, Ying Wang, Juan Manuel Gomez"

A low concentration of ethanol impairs learning but not motor and sensory behavior in Drosophila larvae,22624024,10.1371/journal.pone.0037394,"Drosophila melanogaster has proven to be a useful model system for the genetic analysis of ethanol-associated behaviors. However, past studies have focused on the response of the adult fly to large, and often sedating, doses of ethanol. The pharmacological effects of low and moderate quantities of ethanol have remained understudied. In this study, we tested the acute effects of low doses of ethanol (∼7 mM internal concentration) on Drosophila larvae. While ethanol did not affect locomotion or the response to an odorant, we observed that ethanol impaired associative olfactory learning when the heat shock unconditioned stimulus (US) intensity was low but not when the heat shock US intensity was high. We determined that the reduction in learning at low US intensity was not a result of ethanol anesthesia since ethanol-treated larvae responded to the heat shock in the same manner as untreated animals. Instead, low doses of ethanol likely impair the neuronal plasticity that underlies olfactory associative learning. This impairment in learning was reversible indicating that exposure to low doses of ethanol does not leave any long lasting behavioral or physiological effects.",2012,"Wen-ke Li, Daniel Goan, Michael M Hatch, Melvin C Young, Alfredo Ghezzi, Jonathan Corpuz, Nigel S Atkinson, Kareem B Haroun, Amanda M Cady, Jascha B Pohl, Kristina Najjar, Amar Bhat, Jeffrey C Sun, Omar Hariri, Ruchita R Shah, Ryan M Godinez, Farhan Husain, William Y Chen, Tuan Tran, Foram Desai, Jacxelyn Moran, Allen C Zhong, Brooks G Robinson, Kathryn Fife, Sukant Khurana, Jeff Hooten"

We identified 50 silkworm antioxidant genes from nine gene families based on the assembled genome sequence. A comparative analysis of the antioxidant genes of the silkworm with other order insects Anopheles gambiae, Apis mellifera, Drosophila melanogaster, and Tribolium castaneum, was performed. We found that most of the antioxidant gene families are highly conserved but Catalase (CAT) and heme-containing peroxidase (HPX) families were lineage-specifically expanded in the silkworm. The expression patterns of the silkworm antioxidant genes were investigated with the known ESTs, microarray data, and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Forty two of the 50 silkworm antioxidant genes were transcribed and most of the transcribed genes showed tissue-specific expression patterns. More than a half of lineage-specifically expanded BmCATs lacked 15 or more than 15 of the 36 heme-binding residues and might lose catalase activities. However, the genes encoding these BmCATs showed almost a ubiquitous tissue expression pattern, indicating that they might have evolved new functions. In addition, the lineage-specifically expanded BmHPXs could function in maintaining cell homeostasis in the process of the synthesis of large amounts of silk proteins because they were predominantly expressed in silk gland of the silkworm. The lineage-specific expansion of antioxidant gene families in the silkworm provides useful information for understanding evolution and functional versatility of antioxidant genes in the silkworm even Lepidopteran insects.",2012,"Gui-Qin Shi, Ze Zhang, Quan-You Yu"
Integration of taste and calorie sensing in Drosophila,23077061,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1887-12.2012,"Animals use gustatory information to assess the suitability of potential food sources and make critical decisions on what to consume. For example, the taste of sugar generally signals a potent dietary source of carbohydrates. However, the intensity of the sensory response to a particular sugar, or ""sweetness,"" is not always a faithful reporter of its nutritional value, and recent evidence suggests that animals can sense the caloric content of food independently of taste. Here, we demonstrate that the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster uses both taste and calorie sensing to determine feeding choices, and that the relative contribution of each changes over time. Using the capillary feeder assay, we allowed flies to choose between sources of sugars that varied in their ratio of sweetness to caloric value. We found that flies initially consume sugars according to taste. However, over several hours their preference shifts toward the food source with higher caloric content. This behavioral shift occurs more rapidly following food deprivation and is modulated by cAMP and insulin signaling within neurons. Our results are consistent with the existence of a taste-independent calorie sensor in flies, and suggest that calorie-based reward modifies long-term feeding preferences.",2012,"Jeffrey W Stafford, Aera Y Jung, Michael D Gordon, Kaylea M Lynd"

We have developed a microarray enrichment methodology followed by long-read, next-generation sequencing for identification of unannotated transcript isoforms expressed in two Drosophila tissues, the ovary and the testis. Even with limited sequencing, these studies have identified a large number of novel transcription units, including 5' exons and extensions, 3' exons and extensions, internal exons and exon extensions, gene fusions, and both germline-specific splicing events and promoters. Additionally, comparing our capture dataset with tiling array and traditional RNA-seq analysis, we demonstrate that our enrichment strategy is able to capture low-abundance transcripts that cannot readily be identified by the other strategies. Finally, we show that our methodology can help identify transcriptional signatures of minority cell types within the ovary that would otherwise be difficult to reveal without the CoNECT enrichment strategy.

Control of DNA replication and chromosome ploidy by geminin and cyclin A,11865064,10.1128/mcb.22.6.1868-1880.2002,"Alteration of the control of DNA replication and mitosis is considered to be a major cause of genome instability. To investigate the mechanism that controls DNA replication and genome stability, we used the RNA silencing-interference technique (RNAi) to eliminate the Drosophila geminin homologue from Schneider D2 (SD2) cells. Silencing of geminin by RNAi in SD2 cells leads to the cessation of mitosis and asynchronous overreplication of the genome, with cells containing single giant nuclei and partial ploidy between 4N and 8N DNA content. The effect of geminin deficiency is completely suppressed by cosilencing of Double parked (Dup), the Drosophila homologue of Cdt1, a replication factor to which geminin binds. The geminin deficiency-induced phenotype is also partially suppressed by coablation of Chk1/Grapes, indicating the involvement of Chk1/Grapes in the checkpoint control in response to overreplication. We found that the silencing of cyclin A, but not of cyclin B, also promotes the formation of a giant nucleus and overreplication. However, in contrast to the effect of geminin knockout, cyclin A deficiency leads to the complete duplication of the genome from 4N to 8N. We observed that the silencing of geminin causes rapid downregulation of Cdt1/Dup, which may contribute to the observed partial overreplication in geminin-deficient cells. Analysis of cyclin A and geminin double knockout suggests that the effect of cyclin A deficiency is dominant over that of geminin deficiency for cell cycle arrest and overreplication. Together, our studies indicate that both cyclin A and geminin are required for the suppression of overreplication and for genome stability in Drosophila cells.",2002,"Takeshi Kondo, Leigh Ann Higa, Ivailo S Mihaylov, Lynn Cooley, Hui Zhang, Junko Tanaka, Sophia Ryzhikov, Lynn Jones, Jianyu Zheng, Naoto Minamino"

Age-specific metabolic rates and mortality rates in the genus Drosophila,12882355,10.1046/j.1474-9728.2002.00009.x,"Early theories of aging suggested that organisms with relatively high metabolic rates would live shorter lives. Despite widespread tests of this 'rate of living' theory of aging, there is little empirical evidence to support the idea. A more fine-grained approach that examined age-related changes in metabolic rate over the life span could provide valuable insight into the relationship between metabolic rate and aging. Here we compare age-related metabolic rate (measured as CO2 production per hour) and age-related mortality rate among five species in the genus Drosophila. We find no evidence that longer-lived species have lower metabolic rates. In all five species, there is no clear evidence of an age-related metabolic decline. Metabolic rates are strikingly constant throughout the life course, with the exception of females of D. hydei, in which metabolic rates show an increase over the first third of the life span and then decline. We argue that some physiological traits may have been shaped by such strong selection over evolutionary time that they are relatively resistant to the decline in the force of selection that occurs within the life time of a single individual. We suggest that comparisons of specific traits that do not show signs of aging with those traits that do decline with age could provide insight into the aging process.",2002,"Daniel E L Promislow, Tamara S Haselkorn"

A set of recombinant inbred lines were assayed for ovariole number, and QTL analyses for this trait identified 5,286 positional candidate loci. Forty deletions spanning the QTL were employed to further refine the map position of genes contributing to variation in this trait between parental lines, with six deficiencies showing significant effects and reducing the number of positional candidates to 548. Parental lines were then assayed for expression differences by using Affymetrix microarray technology, and ANOVA was used to identify differentially expressed genes in these deletions. Thirty-four genes were identified that showed evidence for differential expression between the parental lines, one of which was significant even after a conservative Bonferroni correction. The list of potential candidates includes 5 genes for which previous annotations did not exist, and therefore would have been unlikely choices for follow-up from mapping studies alone.

It is not known which of these domains contribute to nucleosome remodelling. We have tested a panel of dMi-2 deletion mutants in ATPase, nucleosome mobilization and nucleosome binding assays. Deletion of the chromodomains impairs all three activities. A dMi-2 mutant lacking the chromodomains is incorporated into a functional histone deacetylase complex in vivo but has lost nucleosome-stimulated ATPase activity. In contrast to dHP1, dMi-2 does not bind methylated histone H3 tails and does not require histone tails for nucleosome binding. Instead, the dMi-2 chromodomains display DNA binding activity that is not shared by other chromodomains.

Genetic control of cuticle formation during embryonic development of Drosophila melanogaster,12019232,,"The embryonic cuticle of Drosophila melanogaster is deposited by the epidermal epithelium during stage 16 of development. This tough, waterproof layer is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of the larval body. We have characterized mutations in a set of genes required for proper deposition and/or morphogenesis of the cuticle. Zygotic disruption of any one of these genes results in embryonic lethality. Mutant embryos are hyperactive within the eggshell, resulting in a high proportion reversed within the eggshell (the ""retroactive"" phenotype), and all show poor cuticle integrity when embryos are mechanically devitellinized. This last property results in embryonic cuticle preparations that appear grossly inflated compared to wild-type cuticles (the ""blimp"" phenotype). We find that one of these genes, krotzkopf verkehrt (kkv), encodes the Drosophila chitin synthase enzyme and that a closely linked gene, knickkopf (knk), encodes a novel protein that shows genetic interaction with the Drosophila E-cadherin, shotgun. We also demonstrate that two other known mutants, grainy head (grh) and retroactive (rtv), show the blimp phenotype when devitellinized, and we describe a new mutation, called zeppelin (zep), that shows the blimp phenotype but does not produce defects in the head cuticle as the other mutations do.",2002,"Herman A Dierick, Stephen Ostrowski, Amy Bejsovec"
Hedgehog regulates cell growth and proliferation by inducing Cyclin D and Cyclin E,12015606,10.1038/417299a,"Although mutations that activate the Hedgehog (Hh) signalling pathway have been linked to several types of cancer, the molecular and cellular basis of Hh's ability to induce tumour formation is not well understood.

Here we show that Hh signalling promotes transcription of Cyclin E and Cyclin D, two inhibitors of Rb, and principal regulators of the cell cycle during development in Drosophila. Upregulation of Cyclin E expression, accomplished through binding of Cubitus interruptus (Ci) to the Cyclin E promoter, mediates the ability of Hh to induce DNA replication.

Inferring the history of speciation from multilocus DNA sequence data: the case of Drosophila pseudoobscura and close relatives,11919289,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a004103,"The divergence of Drosophila pseudoobscura from its close relatives, D. persimilis and D. pseudoobscura bogotana, was examined using the pattern of DNA sequence variation in a common set of 50 inbred lines at 11 loci from diverse locations in the genome. Drosophila pseudoobscura and D. persimilis show a marked excess of low-frequency variation across loci, consistent with a model of recent population expansion in both species. The different loci vary considerably, both in polymorphism levels and in the levels of polymorphisms that are shared by different species pairs. A major question we address is whether these patterns of shared variation are best explained by gene flow or by persistence since common ancestry. A new test of gene flow, based on patterns of linkage disequilibrium, is developed. The results from these, and other tests, support a model in which D. pseudoobscura and D. persimilis have exchanged genes at some loci. However, the pattern of variation suggests that most gene flow, although occurring after speciation began, was not recent. There is less evidence of gene flow between D. pseudoobscura and D. p. bogotana. The results are compared with recent work on the genomic locations of genes that contribute to reproductive isolation between D. pseudoobscura and D. persimilis. We show that there is a good correspondence between the genomic regions associated with reproductive isolation and the regions that show little or no evidence of gene flow.",2002,"Richard M Kliman, Jody Hey, Jeffrey A Markert, Carlos A Machado"
Anterior repression of a Drosophila stripe enhancer requires three position-specific mechanisms,12397102,,"The striped expression pattern of the pair-rule gene even skipped (eve) is established by five stripe-specific enhancers, each of which responds in a unique way to gradients of positional information in the early Drosophila embryo. The enhancer for eve stripe 2 (eve 2) is directly activated by the morphogens Bicoid (Bcd) and Hunchback (Hb). As these proteins are distributed throughout the anterior half of the embryo, formation of a single stripe requires that enhancer activation is prevented in all nuclei anterior to the stripe 2 position. The gap gene giant (gt) is involved in a repression mechanism that sets the anterior stripe border, but genetic removal of gt (or deletion of Gt-binding sites) causes stripe expansion only in the anterior subregion that lies adjacent to the stripe border. We identify a well-conserved sequence repeat, (GTTT)(4), which is required for repression in a more anterior subregion. This site is bound specifically by Sloppy-paired 1 (Slp1), which is expressed in a gap gene-like anterior domain. Ectopic Slp1 activity is sufficient for repression of stripe 2 of the endogenous eve gene, but is not required, suggesting that it is redundant with other anterior factors. Further genetic analysis suggests that the (GTTT)(4)-mediated mechanism is independent of the Gt-mediated mechanism that sets the anterior stripe border, and suggests that a third mechanism, downregulation of Bcd activity by Torso, prevents activation near the anterior tip. Thus, three distinct mechanisms are required for anterior repression of a single eve enhancer, each in a specific position. Ectopic Slp1 also represses eve stripes 1 and 3 to varying degrees, and the eve 1 and eve 3+7 enhancers each contain GTTT repeats similar to the site in the eve 2 enhancer. These results suggest a common mechanism for preventing anterior activation of three different eve enhancers.",2002,"Vikram Vasisht, Ekaterina Theodosopoulou, Adam Oberstein, Luiz Paulo Moura Andrioli, Stephen Small"
Structure and evolution of neurexin genes: insight into the mechanism of alternative splicing,12036300,10.1006/geno.2002.6780,"Neurexins are neuron-specific vertebrate proteins with hundreds of differentially spliced isoforms that may function in synapse organization. We now show that Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans express a single gene encoding only an alpha-neurexin, whereas humans and mice express three genes, each of which encodes alpha- and beta-neurexins transcribed from separate promoters. The neurexin genes are very large (up to 1.62 Mb), with the neurexin-3 gene occupying almost 2% of human chromosome 14. Although invertebrate and vertebrate neurexins exhibit a high degree of evolutionary conservation, only vertebrate neurexins are subject to extensive alternative splicing that uses mechanisms ranging from strings of mini-exons to multiple alternative splice donor and acceptor sites. Consistent with their proposed role in synapse specification, neurexins thus have evolved from relatively simple genes in invertebrates to diversified genes in vertebrates with multiple promoters and extensive alternative splicing.",2002,"Thomas C Südhof, Katsuhiko Tabuchi"

Electrical silencing of Drosophila pacemaker neurons stops the free-running circadian clock,12086605,10.1016/s0092-8674(02)00737-7,"Electrical silencing of Drosophila circadian pacemaker neurons through targeted expression of K+ channels causes severe deficits in free-running circadian locomotor rhythmicity in complete darkness.

In contrast, electrical silencing fails to abolish PER and TIM oscillation in light-dark cycles, although it does impair rhythmic behavior. On the basis of these findings, we propose that electrical activity is an essential element of the free-running molecular clock of pacemaker neurons along with the transcription factors and regulatory enzymes that have been previously identified as required for clock function.",2002,"Justin Blau, Michael N Nitabach, Todd C Holmes"
Promoter-proximal tethering elements regulate enhancer-promoter specificity in the Drosophila Antennapedia complex,12093913,10.1073/pnas.142291299,"Insulator DNAs and promoter competition regulate enhancer-promoter interactions within complex genetic loci. Here we provide evidence for a third mechanism: promoter-proximal tethering elements. The Scr-ftz region of the Antennapedia gene complex includes two known enhancers, AE1 and T1. AE1 selectively interacts with the ftz promoter to maintain pair-rule stripes of ftz expression during gastrulation and germ-band elongation. The T1 enhancer, located 3' of the ftz gene and approximately 25 kb 5' of the Scr promoter, selectively activates Scr expression in the prothorax and posterior head segments. A variety of P element minigenes were examined in transgenic embryos to determine the basis for specific AE1-ftz and T1-Scr interactions. A 450-bp DNA fragment located approximately 100 bp 5' of the Scr transcription start site is essential for T1-Scr interactions and can mediate long-range activation of a ftz/lacZ reporter gene when placed 5' of the ftz promoter. We suggest that the Scr450 fragment contains tethering elements that selectively recruit T1 to the Scr promoter.

We report our initial efforts toward the development of an unnatural in vivo nucleoside phosphorylation pathway that is based on nucleoside salvage enzymes. The first step of this pathway is catalyzed by the D. melanogaster nucleoside kinase, which catalyzes the phosphorylation of nucleosides to the corresponding monophosphates.

Induced overexpression of mitochondrial Mn-superoxide dismutase extends the life span of adult Drosophila melanogaster,12072463,,"A transgenic system (""FLP-out"") based on yeast FLP recombinase allowed induced overexpression of MnSOD enzyme in adult Drosophila melanogaster.

Control (no HP) and overexpressing (HP) flies had identical genetic backgrounds. The amount of MnSOD enzyme overexpression achieved varied among six independent transgenic lines, with increases up to 75%. Life span was increased in proportion to the increase in enzyme. Mean life span was increased by an average of 16%, with some lines showing 30-33% increases. Maximum life span was increased by an average of 15%, with one line showing as much as 37% increase. Simultaneous overexpression of catalase with MnSOD had no added benefit, consistent with previous observations that catalase is present in excess in the adult fly with regard to life span.

Since fragile X patients show a number of abnormal behaviors including sleep problems, we investigated whether a loss-of-function mutation of dfmr1 affect circadian behavior. Here we show that under constant darkness (DD), a lack of dfmr1 expression causes arrhythmic locomotor activity, but in light:dark cycles, their behavioral rhythms appear normal. In addition, the clock-controlled eclosion rhythm is normal in DFMR1-deficient flies.

Ecology and evolution of host-parasite associations: mycophagous Drosophila and their parasitic nematodes,18707451,10.1086/342137,"Associations between mycophagous Drosophila and nematode parasites occur throughout the temperate and boreal regions of North America, Europe, and Asia. The nematode Howardula aoronymphium has substantial adverse effects on host survival and fertility on North American Drosophila. Long-term data show that rainy summers lead to a high prevalence of parasitism in the fall and the following spring, resulting in up to a 1-yr time lag between present rainfall and increased prevalence of H. aoronymphium parasitism. A biogeographic analysis of the relative abundance of different Drosophila species has shown that H. aoronymphium may facilitate the coexistence of different species of Drosophila that compete for larval food resources. The actual host range of parasites in nature is determined by the intrinsic suitability of potential hosts for parasite infection and reproduction and various ecological factors. For H. aoronymphium in eastern North America, intrinsically suitable hosts fall within a restricted clade within the genus Drosophila. However, the temperature sensitivity of H. aoronymphium prevents it from using several host species that occur outside the geographical range of the nematodes. Finally, the host range, virulence, and geographical range of Drosophila-parasitic nematodes appear to be highly dynamic over evolutionary timescales.",2002,"John Jaenike, Steve J Perlman"
Recruitment of cell groups through Delta/Notch signalling during spider neurogenesis,12403706,10.1242/dev.00109,"Early neurogenesis in the spider is characterised by a stereotyped pattern of sequential recruitment of neural cells from the neuroectoderm, comparable with neuroblast formation in Drosophila: However, in contrast to Drosophila, where single cells delaminate from the neuroectoderm, groups of cells adopt the neural fate and invaginate into the spider embryo. This raises the question of whether Delta/Notch signalling is involved in this process, as this system normally leads to a singling out of individual cells through lateral inhibition. I have therefore cloned homologues of Delta and Notch from the spider Cupiennius salei and studied their expression and function. The genes are indeed expressed during the formation of neural cells in the ventral neuroectoderm. Loss of function of either gene leads to an upregulation of the proneural genes and an altered morphology of the neuroectoderm that is comparable with Delta and Notch mutant phenotypes in Drosophila: Thus, although Delta/Notch signalling appears to be used in the same way as in Drosophila, the lateral inhibition process produces clusters of invaginating cells, rather than single cells. Intriguingly, neuroectodermal cells that are not invaginating seem to become neural cells at a later stage, while the epidermal cells are derived from lateral regions that overgrow the neuroectoderm. In this respect, the neuroectodermal region of the spider is more similar to the neural plate of vertebrates, than to the neuroectoderm of Drosophila:",2002,Angelika Stollewerk

One well-studied example of such a morphogenetic episode is dorsal closure in Drosophila embryogenesis. This process is tractable at a genetic level and has recently become the focus of live cell biology analysis because of the availability of flies expressing GFP-fusion proteins. This marriage of genetics and cell biology is very powerful and is allowing the dissection of fundamental signaling mechanisms that regulate the cytoskeletal reorganizations and contractions underlying coordinated tissue movements in the embryo.",2002,"Paul Martin, Sarah Woolner, Antonio Jacinto"

The sampling study suggests that, for the particular data analyzed here, even moderately large experiments, of the order of 10(4) individuals, can have a high probability of detecting sex-limited effects when they are not actually present. If a particular QTL is present in both sexes, and if the probability of detecting it in each sex is moderately high, say 80%, then there is a 32% chance of erroneously concluding that there is sex specificity. A comparison of interval mapping and composite interval mapping methods of data analysis suggests that the latter can inflate the appearance of sex specificity and sexual antagonism, depending on the choice of number of background covariates in the analysis. Conclusive evidence for sex-limited QTLs will require demonstration that results are robust to methods of statistical analysis, and experimental replication.",2002,James W Curtsinger
"Sox9 transactivation and testicular expression of a novel human gene, KIAA0800",12111997,10.1002/jcb.10214,"The Sry and Sox9 sex-determination factors initiate and promote testis differentiation by gene transactivation through similar promoter elements. However, knowledge is limited concerning what genes are regulated by Sry/Sox9 in the testis. Identification and characterization of Sry/Sox9-regulated genes are critical for understanding sexual differentiation. We now demonstrate that a novel human gene, KIAA0800, is preferentially expressed in the testis and is transactivated by Sox9. The KIAA0800 promoter is repressed by an upstream element involving a polyT track and two Alu repeats. Two specific Sox9-bindings sites have been identified in the KIAA0800 promoter by using DNaseI footprinting assays and gel electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Sox9 transactivation of the KIAA0800 promoter appears to be exerted mainly through the relief of promoter repression. Genes homologous to the human KIAA0800 exist in organisms with differentiated sex tissues including mouse, Drosophila, and C. elegans, but not in unicellular organisms, including yeast and bacteria. Further, our recent sequence analysis shows that KIAA0800 protein is 97% identical between human and mouse. Thus, KIAA0800 is a novel Sox9-activated gene that is evolutionarily conserved and potentially involved in sexual differentiation.",2002,"Ling-Jun Zhao, G Chinnadurai, Shangao Zhang"
"[Molecular genetics of radiation-induced chromosome breaks in a gene area in Drosophila: ""position"" effect of gene mutation?]",12530131,,"On the sample of 43 gamma-ray and neutron-induced inversion or translocation exchanges with the vestigial (vg) phenotype, the molecular cytogenetic analysis of distribution of exchange breakpoints on the molecular map of Drosophila vg region (subsection 49D3-4 on the polytene chromosome 2R) was performed using hybridisation in situ technique. Simultaneously, PCR-assay of DNA alterations in all exons and introns (except for intron 4) of the vg gene for 18 mutants with exchange breakpoints outside of the gene was carried out. The results obtained by these molecular genetic techniques have shown that 1) radiation-induced breaks under chromosome exchanges with the vg phenotype were regularly located inside of the vg gene (19 cases out of 43 studied ones or 44.2%) passing through the large introns; 2) breakpoints were frequently flanked by deletions of the gene as whole (3 exchanges) or of its major part (3 exchanges); 3) many of the breaks (18/43 or 41.8%) are situated outside (distal or proximal) of the gene although such mutants have got the vg phenotype; 4) 2/3 (12/18 or 66.7%) vg mutants with the breakpoint outside of gene show the intragenic DNA lesions (microdeletions, microinversions) occurring obviously independently and simultaneously with the neighbor chromosome breaks; 5) only each third vg mutant with break outside of the gene (6/18 or 33.3%) have the unchanged gene subregions under study and presents obviously the result of ""position effect"" which appear to manifest itself for a distance of 2-30 kb (more near and farther locations of the proximal and distal breakpoints, respectively, relative to the vg gene).

A role for casein kinase 2alpha in the Drosophila circadian clock,12447397,10.1038/nature01235,"Circadian clocks drive rhythmic behaviour in animals and are regulated by transcriptional feedback loops. For example, the Drosophila proteins Clock (Clk) and Cycle (Cyc) activate transcription of period (per) and timeless (tim). Per and Tim then associate, translocate to the nucleus, and repress the activity of Clk and Cyc. However, post-translational modifications are also critical to proper timing. Per and Tim undergo rhythmic changes in phosphorylation, and evidence supports roles for two kinases in this process: Doubletime (Dbt) phosphorylates Per, whereas Shaggy (Sgg) phosphorylates Tim. Yet Sgg and Dbt often require a phosphoserine in their target site, and analysis of Per phosphorylation in dbt mutants suggests a role for other kinases. Here we show that the catalytic subunit of Drosophila casein kinase 2 (CK2alpha) is expressed predominantly in the cytoplasm of key circadian pacemaker neurons. CK2alpha mutant flies show lengthened circadian period, decreased CK2 activity, and delayed nuclear entry of Per. These effects are probably direct, as CK2alpha specifically phosphorylates Per in vitro.

We provide evidence that two different regions of the Lmd protein are critical for modulating the balance between its nuclear translocation and its retention within the cytoplasm. Activation of the Lmd protein is also tempered by posttranslational modifications of the protein that do not detectably change its subcellular localization. We further show that overexpression of Lmd protein derivatives that are constitutively nuclear or hyperactive results in severe muscle defects. These findings underscore the importance of regulated Lmd protein activity in maintaining proper activation of downstream target genes, such as Mef2, within fusion-competent myoblasts.",2006,"Hong Duan, Hanh T Nguyen"
The origin of centrosomes in parthenogenetic hymenopteran insects,16631588,10.1016/j.cub.2006.03.066,"A longstanding enigma has been the origin of maternal centrosomes that facilitate parthenogenetic development in Hymenopteran insects. In young embryos, hundreds of microtubule-organizing centers (MTOCs) are assembled completely from maternal components. Two of these MTOCs join the female pronucleus to set up the first mitotic spindle in unfertilized embryos and drive their development. These MTOCs appear to be canonical centrosomes because they contain gamma-tubulin, CP190, and centrioles and they undergo duplication. Here, we present evidence that these centrosomes originate from accessory nuclei (AN), organelles derived from the oocyte nuclear envelope. In the parasitic wasps Nasonia vitripennis and Muscidifurax uniraptor, the position and number of AN in mature oocytes correspond to the position and number of maternal centrosomes in early embryos. These AN also contain high concentrations of gamma-tubulin. In the honeybee, Apis mellifera, distinct gamma-tubulin foci are present in each AN. Additionally, the Hymenopteran homolog of the Drosophila centrosomal protein Dgrip84 localizes on the outer surfaces of AN. These organelles disintegrate in the late oocyte, leaving behind small gamma-tubulin foci, which likely seed the formation of maternal centrosomes. Accessory nuclei, therefore, may have played a significant role in the evolution of haplodiploidy in Hymenopteran insects.",2006,"Kent McDonald, Patrick M Ferree, Barbara Fasulo, William Sullivan"
A simple genetic incompatibility causes hybrid male sterility in mimulus,16415357,10.1534/genetics.105.053686,"Much evidence has shown that postzygotic reproductive isolation (hybrid inviability or sterility) evolves by the accumulation of interlocus incompatibilities between diverging populations. Although in theory only a single pair of incompatible loci is needed to isolate species, empirical work in Drosophila has revealed that hybrid fertility problems often are highly polygenic and complex. In this article we investigate the genetic basis of hybrid sterility between two closely related species of monkeyflower, Mimulus guttatus and M. nasutus. In striking contrast to Drosophila systems, we demonstrate that nearly complete hybrid male sterility in Mimulus results from a simple genetic incompatibility between a single pair of heterospecific loci. We have genetically mapped this sterility effect: the M. guttatus allele at the hybrid male sterility 1 (hms1) locus acts dominantly in combination with recessive M. nasutus alleles at the hybrid male sterility 2 (hms2) locus to cause nearly complete hybrid male sterility. In a preliminary screen to find additional small-effect male sterility factors, we identified one additional locus that also contributes to some of the variation in hybrid male fertility. Interestingly, hms1 and hms2 also cause a significant reduction in hybrid female fertility, suggesting that sex-specific hybrid defects might share a common genetic basis. This possibility is supported by our discovery that recombination is reduced dramatically in a cross involving a parent with the hms1-hms2 incompatibility.",2006,"John H Willis, Andrea L Sweigart, Lila Fishman"
Reduced inbreeding depression due to historical inbreeding in Drosophila melanogaster: evidence for purging,16780526,10.1111/j.1420-9101.2005.01074.x,"An important issue in conservation biology and the study of evolution is the extent to which inbreeding depression can be reduced or reversed by natural selection. If the deleterious recessive alleles causing inbreeding depression can be 'purged' by natural selection, outbred populations that have a history of inbreeding are expected to be less susceptible to inbreeding depression. This expectation, however, has not been realized in previous laboratory experiments. In the present study, we used Drosophila melanogaster as a model system to test for an association between inbreeding history and inbreeding depression. We created six 'purged' populations from experimental lineages that had been maintained at a population size of 10 male-female pairs for 19 generations. We then measured the inbreeding depression that resulted from one generation of full-sib mating in the purged populations and in the original base population. The magnitude of inbreeding depression in the purged populations was approximately one-third of that observed in the original base population. In contrast to previous laboratory experiments, therefore, we found that inbreeding depression was reduced in populations that have a history of inbreeding. The large purging effects observed in this study may be attributable to the rate of historical inbreeding examined, which was slower than that considered in previous experiments.",2006,"W R Swindell, J L Bouzat"
The histone chaperone ASF1 localizes to active DNA replication forks to mediate efficient DNA replication,16396992,10.1096/fj.05-5020fje,"The packaging of the eukaryotic genome into chromatin is likely to regulate all processes that occur on the DNA template. The assembly and disassembly of chromatin structures from histone proteins and DNA are mediated by histone chaperones, including the histone H3/H4 chaperone anti-silencing function 1 (ASF1). To address the function of ASF1 in metazoan cells, we used RNA interference-mediated knockdown of Drosophila melanogaster ASF1 (dASF1). Cells lacking dASF1 accumulate in S phase of the cell cycle as determined by flow cytometry analysis of DNA content and quantitation of the proportion of cells with replication foci. In agreement, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) pulse-chase analysis demonstrates that the absence of ASF1 leads to delayed progression through S-phase. Furthermore, the absence of ASF1 leads to a reduced ability to incorporate the nucleoside analog BrdU, indicating that ASF1 is required for efficient DNA replication. We have also found that dASF1 colocalizes with DNA replication foci throughout S phase by immunofluorescence analysis and that these dASF1 foci are disrupted upon inhibition of DNA replication by treatment of cells with hydroxyurea. As such, these results demonstrate that dASF1 is present at active, but not stalled, replication forks. We propose that dASF1 has a direct role in modifying chromatin structure during DNA replication and that this function of dASF1 is important for the processivity of the replication machinery.",2006,"Jessica K Tyler, Laura L Schulz"

Mutations in the K+/Cl- cotransporter gene kazachoc (kcc) increase seizure susceptibility in Drosophila,16943550,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4998-05.2006,"During a critical period in the developing mammalian brain, there is a major switch in the nature of GABAergic transmission from depolarizing and excitatory, the pattern of the neonatal brain, to hyperpolarizing and inhibitory, the pattern of the mature brain. This switch is believed to play a major role in determining neuronal connectivity via activity-dependent mechanisms. The GABAergic developmental switch may also be particularly vulnerable to dysfunction leading to seizure disorders. The developmental GABA switch is mediated primarily by KCC2, a neuronal K+/Cl- cotransporter that determines the intracellular concentration of Cl- and, hence, the reversal potential for GABA. Here, we report that kazachoc (kcc) mutations that reduce the level of the sole K+/Cl- cotransporter in the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster render flies susceptible to epileptic-like seizures. Drosophila kcc protein is widely expressed in brain neuropil, and its level rises with developmental age. Young kcc mutant flies with low kcc levels display behavioral seizures and demonstrate a reduced threshold for seizures induced by electroconvulsive shock. The kcc mutation enhances a series of other Drosophila epilepsy mutations indicating functional interactions leading to seizure disorder. Both genetic and pharmacological experiments suggest that the increased seizure susceptibility of kcc flies occurs via excitatory GABAergic signaling. The kcc mutants provide an excellent model system in which to investigate how modulation of GABAergic signaling influences neuronal excitability and epileptogenesis.",2006,"Mark A Tanouye, Daria S Hekmat-Scafe, Miriam Y Lundy, Rakhee Ranga"
Separating the adhesive and signaling functions of the Fat and Dachsous protocadherins,16687445,10.1242/dev.02401,"The protocadherins Fat (Ft) and Dachsous (Ds) are required for several processes in the development of Drosophila, including controlling growth of imaginal discs, planar cell polarity (PCP) and the proximodistal patterning of appendages. Ft and Ds bind in a preferentially heterophilic fashion, and Ds is expressed in distinct patterns along the axes of polarity. It has thus been suggested that Ft and Ds serve not as adhesion molecules, but as receptor and ligand in a poorly understood signaling pathway. To test this hypothesis, we performed a structure-function analysis of Ft and Ds, separating their adhesive and signaling functions. We found that the extracellular domain of Ft is not required for its activity in growth, PCP and proximodistal patterning. Thus, ligand binding is not necessary for Ft activity. By contrast, the extracellular domain of Ds is necessary and sufficient to mediate its effects on PCP, consistent with the model that Ds acts as a ligand during PCP. However, we also provide evidence that Ds can regulate growth independently of Ft, and that the intracellular domain of Ds can affect proximodistal patterning, both suggestive of functions independent of binding Ft. Finally, we show that ft mutants or a dominant-negative Ft construct can affect disc growth without changes in the expression of wingless and Wingless target genes.",2006,"Hitoshi Matakatsu, Seth S Blair"

Differential expression of the detoxification genes in the different life stages of the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae,16907839,10.1111/j.1365-2583.2006.00667.x,"The diverse habitats and diets encountered during the life cycle of an Anopheles mosquito have necessitated the development of extensive families of detoxification enzymes. Expansion of the three detoxification enzyme families (cytochrome P450s, carboxylesterases and glutathione transfereases), has occurred in mosquitoes compared with Drosophila, however, very little is known regarding the developmental expression of theses genes. Using a custom made microarray we determined the expression profile of the detoxification genes in adults, larvae and pupae of the malaria vector A. gambiae. The expression of approximately one quarter of these genes was developmentally regulated. The expression profile of each of these genes and the information this data provides on putative functions of the mosquito detoxification enzymes is discussed.",2006,"F Ortelli, H Ranson, K Steen, C Strode"
The deficit in low molecular weight thiols as a target for antiageing therapy,17100590,10.2174/1389450110607011505,"The popular use of antioxidative vitamins illustrates the growing awareness of oxidative stress as an important hazard to our health and as an important factor in the ageing process. Superoxide radicals and superoxide-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) are constantly formed in most cells and tissues. To ensure that ROS can function as biological signaling molecules without excessive tissue damage, ROS are typically scavenged by antioxidants such as glutathione and the vitamins A, C, and E. ""Oxidative stress"" occurs if the production of ROS is abnormally increased or antioxidant concentrations are decreased. Genetic studies in mice, Drosophila, and C.elegans suggested that ageing may be mechanistically linked to oxidative stress. Several manifestations of oxidative stress were shown to increase with age, whereas tissue levels of vitamin E, plasma concentrations of vitamin C, and intracellular glutathione concentrations decrease with age. In at least two independent studies, cysteine supplementation on top of the normal protein diet has shown significant beneficial effects on each of several different parameters relevant to ageing, including skeletal muscle functions. As the quality of life in old age is severely compromised by the loss of skeletal muscle function, and as muscle function can be measured with satisfactory precision, loss of muscle function is one of the most attractive surrogate parameters of ageing. The mechanisms by which a deficit in glutathione and its precursor cysteine contributes to various ageing-related degenerative processes appears to be related largely but not exclusively to the dysregulation of redox-regulated biological signaling cascades.",2006,"Wulf Dröge, Thomas Schmitt, Ralf Kinscherf, Wulf Hildebrandt"
A generalization of the van-der-Pol oscillator underlies active signal amplification in Drosophila hearing,16612585,10.1007/s00249-006-0059-5,"The antennal hearing organs of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster boost their sensitivity by an active mechanical process that, analogous to the cochlear amplifier of vertebrates, resides in the motility of mechanosensory cells. This process nonlinearly improves the sensitivity of hearing and occasionally gives rise to self-sustained oscillations in the absence of sound. Time series analysis of self-sustained oscillations now unveils that the underlying dynamical system is well described by a generalization of the van-der-Pol oscillator. From the dynamic equations, the underlying amplification dynamics can explicitly be derived. According to the model, oscillations emerge from a combination of negative damping, which reflects active amplification, and a nonlinear restoring force that dictates the amplitude of the oscillations. Hence, active amplification in fly hearing seems to rely on the negative damping mechanism initially proposed for the cochlear amplifier of vertebrates.",2006,"B P Bezrucko, M C Göpfert, R Stoop, D A Smirnov, T V Dikanev, A Kern"
Flies deficient in Muscleblind protein model features of myotonic dystrophy with altered splice forms of Z-band associated transcripts,16927100,10.1007/s00439-006-0228-8,"Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is a dominantly inherited neuromuscular disorder characterised by muscle weakness and wasting. There are two forms of DM; both of which are caused by the expansion of repeated DNA sequences. DM1 is associated with a CTG repeat located in the 3' untranslated region of a gene, DMPK and DM2 with a tetranucleotide repeat expansion, CCTG, located in the first intron of a different gene, ZNF9. Recent data suggest a dominant RNA gain-of-function mechanism underlying DM, as transcripts containing either CUG or CCUG repeat expansions accumulate as foci in the nuclei of DM1 and DM2 cells respectively, where they exert a toxic effect, sequestering specific RNA binding proteins such as Muscleblind, which leads to splicing defects and the disruption of normal cellular functions. Z-band disruption is a well-known histological feature of DM1 muscle, which has also been reported in Muscleblind deficient flies. In order to determine whether there is a common molecular basis for this abnormality we have examined the alternative splicing pattern of transcripts that encode proteins associated with the Z-band in both organisms. Our results demonstrate that the missplicing of ZASP/LDB3 leads to the expression of an isoform in DM1 patient muscle, which is not present in normal controls, nor in other myopathies. Furthermore the Drosophila homologue, CG30084, is also misspliced, in Muscleblind deficient flies. Another Z-band transcript, alpha actinin, is misspliced in mbl mutant flies, but not in DM1 patient samples. These results point to similarities but subtle differences in the molecular breakdown of Z-band structures in flies and DM patients and emphasise the relevance of Muscleblind proteins in DM pathophysiology.",2006,"Laura Machuca-Tzili, Thelma E Robinson, J David Brook, Caroline Sewry, Helena Thorpe"
The Saccharomyces cerevisiae orthologue of the human protein phosphatase 4 core regulatory subunit R2 confers resistance to the anticancer drug cisplatin,16857015,10.1111/j.1742-4658.2006.05336.x,"The anticancer agents cisplatin and oxaliplatin are widely used in the treatment of human neoplasias. A genome-wide screen in Saccharomyces cerevisiae previously identified PPH3 and PSY2 among the top 20 genes conferring resistance to these anticancer agents. The mammalian orthologue of Pph3p is the protein serine/threonine phosphatase Ppp4c, which is found in high molecular mass complexes bound to a regulatory subunit R2. We show here that the putative S. cerevisiae orthologue of R2, which is encoded by ORF YBL046w, binds to Pph3p and exhibits the same unusually high asymmetry as mammalian R2. Despite the essential function of Ppp4c-R2 in microtubule-related processes at centrosomes in higher eukaryotes, S. cerevisiae diploid strains with homozygous deletion of YBL046w and two or one functional copies of the TUB2 gene were viable and no more sensitive to microtubule-depolymerizing drugs than the control strain. The protein encoded by YBL046w exhibited a predominantly nuclear localization. These studies suggest that the centrosomal function of Ppp4c-R2 is not required or may be performed by a different phosphatase in yeast. Homozygous diploid deletion strains of S. cerevisiae, pph3Delta, ybl046wDelta and psy2Delta, were all more sensitive to cisplatin than the control strain. The YBL046w gene therefore confers resistance to cisplatin and was termed PSY4 (platinum sensitivity 4). Ppp4c, R2 and the putative orthologue of Psy2p (termed R3) are shown here to form a complex in Drosophila melanogaster and mammalian cells. By comparison with the yeast system, this complex may confer resistance to cisplatin in higher eukaryotes.",2006,"Cristina Vázquez-Martin, C James Hastie, Amanda Philp, Patricia T W Cohen, Michael J R Stark"
The role of megalin (LRP-2/Gp330) during development,16828734,10.1016/j.ydbio.2006.06.007,"Megalin (LRP-2/GP330), a member of the LDL receptor family, is an endocytic receptor expressed mainly in polarised epithelial cells. Identified as the pathogenic autoantigen of Heymann nephritis in rats, its functions have been studied in greatest detail in adult mammalian kidney, but there is increasing recognition of its involvement in embryonic development. The megalin homologue LRP-1 is essential for growth and development in Caenorhabditis elegans and megalin plays a role in CNS development in zebrafish. There is now also evidence for a homologue in Drosophila. However, most research concerns mammalian embryogenesis; it is widely accepted to be important during forebrain development and the developing renal proximal tubule. Megalin is also expressed in lung, eye, intestine, uterus, oviduct, and male reproductive tract. It is found in yolk sacs and the outer cells of pre-implantation mouse embryos, where interactions with cubilin result in nutrient endocytosis, and it may be important during implantation. Models for megalin interaction(s) with Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) have been proposed. The importance of Shh signalling during embryogenesis is well established; how and when megalin interacts with Shh is becoming a pertinent question in developmental biology.",2006,"Sarah E M Howie, Carolyn E Fisher"
Identification of pathways regulating cell size and cell-cycle progression by RNAi,16496002,10.1038/nature04469,"Many high-throughput loss-of-function analyses of the eukaryotic cell cycle have relied on the unicellular yeast species Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. In multicellular organisms, however, additional control mechanisms regulate the cell cycle to specify the size of the organism and its constituent organs. To identify such genes, here we analysed the effect of the loss of function of 70% of Drosophila genes (including 90% of genes conserved in human) on cell-cycle progression of S2 cells using flow cytometry. To address redundancy, we also targeted genes involved in protein phosphorylation simultaneously with their homologues. We identify genes that control cell size, cytokinesis, cell death and/or apoptosis, and the G1 and G2/M phases of the cell cycle. Classification of the genes into pathways by unsupervised hierarchical clustering on the basis of these phenotypes shows that, in addition to classical regulatory mechanisms such as Myc/Max, Cyclin/Cdk and E2F, cell-cycle progression in S2 cells is controlled by vesicular and nuclear transport proteins, COP9 signalosome activity and four extracellular-signal-regulated pathways (Wnt, p38betaMAPK, FRAP/TOR and JAK/STAT). In addition, by simultaneously analysing several phenotypes, we identify a translational regulator, eIF-3p66, that specifically affects the Cyclin/Cdk pathway activity.",2006,"Jussi Taipale, Markku Varjosalo, Juhani Lahdenperä, Minna Taipale, Juha Saharinen, Mikael Björklund"
Cactophilic Drosophila in South America: a model for evolutionary studies,16502085,10.1007/s10709-005-1432-5,"The Drosophila buzzatii cluster is composed of seven cactophilic species and their known geographical distribution encompasses the open vegetation diagonal, which includes the morphoclimatic Domains of the Caatinga, Chaco and Cerrado, which are situated between the Amazon and the Atlantic forests. Besides these areas, these cactophilic species are also found in a narrow strip along the Atlantic coast from northeastern Brazil to the southern tip of the country. The hypothesis of vicariant events, defining the core areas of each species, is proposed to explain the historical diversification for the cluster. The intraspecific analysis for the cluster shows a population structure with gene flow restricted by distance, range expansion with secondary contact resulting in introgression and simpatry, especially in the limits of the species distribution, polytypic populations and assortative mating in inter population experiments. There is a variation related to these events that depends on the species and geographic origin of the population analyzed. These events are, hypothetically, described as the results of expansion and retraction of the population ranges, as a consequence of their association with cacti, which theoretically follow the expansion and retraction of dry areas during the paleoclimatic oscillations in South America, as that promoted by the glacial cycles of the Quaternary. The Drosophila buzzatii cluster is divided into two groups. The first one is composed of D. buzzatii, a species that has a broad geographic distribution and no significant differentiation between its populations. The second is the Drosophila serido sibling set, which encompasses the others species and is characterized by a significant potential for differentiation.",2006,"Maura Helena Manfrin, Fabio Melo Sene"
Novel genes derived from noncoding DNA in Drosophila melanogaster are frequently X-linked and exhibit testis-biased expression,16777968,10.1073/pnas.0509809103,"Descriptions of recently evolved genes suggest several mechanisms of origin including exon shuffling, gene fission/fusion, retrotransposition, duplication-divergence, and lateral gene transfer, all of which involve recruitment of preexisting genes or genetic elements into new function.

We used the well annotated genome of the genetic model system Drosophila melanogaster and genome sequences of related species to carry out a whole-genome search for new D. melanogaster genes that are derived from noncoding DNA. Here, we describe five such genes, four of which are X-linked. Our RT-PCR experiments show that all five putative novel genes are expressed predominantly in testes.

Activity-dependent gating of CaMKII autonomous activity by Drosophila CASK,16880127,10.1016/j.neuron.2006.06.020,"The ability of CaMKII to act as a molecular switch, becoming Ca(2+) independent after activation and autophosphorylation at T287, is critical for experience-dependent plasticity. Here, we show that the Drosophila homolog of CASK, also known as Camguk, can act as a gain controller on the transition to calcium-independence in vivo. Genetic loss of dCASK significantly increases synapse-specific, activity-dependent autophosphorylation of CaMKII T287. In wild-type adult animals, simple and complex sensory stimuli cause region-specific increases in pT287. dCASK-deficient adults have a reduced dynamic range for activity-dependent T287 phosphorylation and have circuit-level defects that result in inappropriate activation of the kinase. dCASK control of the CaMKII switch occurs via its ability to induce autophosphorylation of T306 in the kinase's CaM binding domain. Phosphorylation of T306 blocks Ca(2+)/CaM binding, lowering the probability of intersubunit T287 phosphorylation, which requires CaM binding to both the substrate and catalytic subunits. dCASK is the first CaMKII-interacting protein other than CaM found to regulate this plasticity-controlling molecular switch.",2006,"James J L Hodge, Leslie C Griffith, Praseeda Mullasseril"
"Independence of genetic geographical variation between photoperiodic diapause, circadian eclosion rhythm, and Thr-Gly repeat region of the period gene in Drosophila littoralis",16461980,10.1177/0748730405283418,"Drosophila littoralis is a latitudinally widespread European species of the Drosophila virilis group. The species has ample genetic variation in photoperiodism (adult diapause) and circadian rhythmicity (pupal eclosion rhythm), with adaptive latitudinal clines in both of them. The possible common genetic basis between the variability of photoperiodism and circadian rhythms was studied by a long-term crossing experiment. A northern strain (65 degrees N) having long critical day length (CDL = 19.9 h) for diapause, early phase of the entrained rhythm in LD 3:21 (psi(LD3:21) = 12.3 h), and short period (tau= 18.8 h) of the free-running rhythm for the eclosion rhythm was crossed with a southern strain (42 degrees N) having short CDL (12.4 h), late eclosion phase (psi(LD3:21) = 20.2 h), and long period (tau= 22.8 h). After 54 generations, including free recombination, artificial selection, and genetic drift, a novel strain resulted, having even more ""southern"" diapause and more ""northern"" eclosion rhythm characteristics than found in any of the geographical strains. The observed complete separation of eclosion rhythm characteristics from photoperiodism is a new finding in D. littoralis; in earlier studies followed for 16 generations, the changes had been mostly parallel. Evidently, the genes controlling the variability of the eclosion rhythm and photoperiodism in D. littoralis are different but closely linked. To test for the possible gene loci underlying the observed geographical variability, the period gene was studied in 10 strains covering all the known clock variability in D. littoralis. The authors sequenced the most suspected Thr-Gly region, which is known to take part in the adaptive clock variability in Drosophila melanogaster. No coding differences were found in the strains, showing that this region is not included in the adaptive clock variability in D. littoralis.",2006,"P Forsman, P Lankinen"
Rethinking some mechanisms invoked to explain translational regulation in eukaryotes,16859839,10.1016/j.gene.2006.06.004,"Real progress in understanding translational regulatory mechanisms lags behind the claims of progress. Novel mechanisms were proclaimed in recent months for some important regulatory proteins from Drosophila (e.g. Bruno, Sex-lethal, Reaper), but the evidence is thin. Many flaws in the design and interpretation of new experiments can be traced to older experiments which came to be accepted, not because the evidence was overwhelming, but because the ideas were appealing. Two of these classic examples of translational regulation are discussed before taking up the newer findings. One paradigm concerns regulation of 15-lipoxygenase production during reticulocyte maturation. The mechanism postulated for 15-lipoxygenase was pieced together in vitro and has never been linked in a meaningful way to what happens naturally in reticulocytes; nevertheless, these experiments have guided (or misguided) thinking about how sequences near the 3' end of an mRNA might regulate translation. The second paradigm concerns the regulation of cyclin B1 translation in Xenopus oocytes by a protein called Maskin, which purportedly interacts with initiation factors. A third topic discussed in some detail concerns the idea that in eukaryotes, as in prokaryotes, initiation of translation might involve base-pairing between mRNA and ribosomal RNA. Recent experiments undertaken to test this idea in yeast are far from conclusive. Many of the experimental defects brought to light in this review are simple-absence of controls, reliance on indirect tests, failure to test a new test system before using it; these things are fixable. Special problems are posed by the practice of using internal ribosome entry sequences (IRESs) as tools to figure out how translation might be regulated by other components. Unanswered questions about the IRESs themselves have to be resolved before they can be used confidently as tools.",2006,Marilyn Kozak
Flux control and excess capacity in the enzymes of glycolysis and their relationship to flight metabolism in Drosophila melanogaster,17159148,10.1073/pnas.0607095104,"An important question in evolutionary and physiological genetics is how the control of flux-base phenotypes is distributed across the enzymes in a pathway. This control is often related to enzyme-specific levels of activity that are reported to be in excess of that required for demand. In glycolysis, metabolic control is frequently considered vested in classical regulatory enzymes, each strongly displaced from equilibrium. Yet the contribution of individual steps to control is unclear. To assess enzyme-specific control in the glycolytic pathway, we used P-element excision-derived mutagenesis in Drosophila melanogaster to generate full and partial knockouts of seven metabolic genes and to measure tethered flight performance. For most enzymes, we find that reduction to half of the normal activity has no measurable impact on wing beat frequency. The enzymes catalyzing near-equilibrium reactions, phosphoglucose isomerase, phosphoglucomutase, and triosephosphate isomerase fail to show any decline in flight performance even when activity levels are reduced to 17% or less. At reduced activities, the classic regulatory enzymes, hexokinase and glycogen phosphorylase, show significant drops in flight performance and are nearer to saturation. Our results show that flight performance is canalized or robust to the activity variation found in natural populations. Furthermore, enzymes catalyzing near-equilibrium reactions show strong genetic dominance down to low levels of activity. This implies considerable excess enzyme capacity for these enzymes.",2006,"Jonathan M Flowers, Chen-Tseh Zhu, Efe Sezgin, Seiji Kumagai, Thomas J S Merritt, Walter F Eanes"
Preparation of Mitochondrial Enriched Fractions for Metabolic Analysis in Drosophila,26485391,10.3791/53149,"Since mitochondria play roles in amino acid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism and fatty acid oxidation, defects in mitochondrial function often compromise the lives of those who suffer from these complex diseases. Detecting mitochondrial metabolic changes is vital to the understanding of mitochondrial disorders and mitochondrial responses to pharmacological agents. Although mitochondrial metabolism is at the core of metabolic regulation, the detection of subtle changes in mitochondrial metabolism may be hindered by the overrepresentation of other cytosolic metabolites obtained using whole organism or whole tissue extractions. Here we describe an isolation method that detected pronounced mitochondrial metabolic changes in Drosophila that were distinct between whole-fly and mitochondrial enriched preparations. To illustrate the sensitivity of this method, we used a set of Drosophila harboring genetically diverse mitochondrial DNAs (mtDNA) and exposed them to the drug rapamycin. Using this method we showed that rapamycin modifies mitochondrial metabolism in a mitochondrial-genotype-dependent manner. However, these changes are much more distinct in metabolomics studies when metabolites were extracted from mitochondrial enriched fractions. In contrast, whole tissue extracts only detected metabolic changes mediated by the drug rapamycin independently of mtDNAs.",2015,"Eugenia Villa-Cuesta, David M Rand"
Increased autophagy and apoptosis contribute to muscle atrophy in a myotonic dystrophy type 1 Drosophila model,26092529,10.1242/dmm.018127,"Muscle mass wasting is one of the most debilitating symptoms of myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) disease, ultimately leading to immobility, respiratory defects, dysarthria, dysphagia and death in advanced stages of the disease. In order to study the molecular mechanisms leading to the degenerative loss of adult muscle tissue in DM1, we generated an inducible Drosophila model of expanded CTG trinucleotide repeat toxicity that resembles an adult-onset form of the disease. Heat-shock induced expression of 480 CUG repeats in adult flies resulted in a reduction in the area of the indirect flight muscles. In these model flies, reduction of muscle area was concomitant with increased apoptosis and autophagy. Inhibition of apoptosis or autophagy mediated by the overexpression of DIAP1, mTOR (also known as Tor) or muscleblind, or by RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated silencing of autophagy regulatory genes, achieved a rescue of the muscle-loss phenotype. In fact, mTOR overexpression rescued muscle size to a size comparable to that in control flies. These results were validated in skeletal muscle biopsies from DM1 patients in which we found downregulated autophagy and apoptosis repressor genes, and also in DM1 myoblasts where we found increased autophagy. These findings provide new insights into the signaling pathways involved in DM1 disease pathogenesis.",2015,"Estefanía Cerro-Herreros, Beatriz Llamusi, Juan M Fernandez-Costa, Ariadna Bargiela, Ruben Artero, Juan J Vilchez"
Consumption of dietary sugar by gut bacteria determines Drosophila lipid content,26382071,10.1098/rsbl.2015.0469,"Gut microorganisms are essential for the nutritional health of many animals, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. This study investigated how lipid accumulation by adult Drosophila melanogaster is reduced in flies associated with the bacterium Acetobacter tropicalis which displays oral-faecal cycling between the gut and food. We demonstrate that the lower lipid content of A. tropicalis-colonized flies relative to bacteria-free flies is linked with a parallel bacterial-mediated reduction in food glucose content; and can be accounted for quantitatively by the amount of glucose acquired by the flies, as determined from the feeding rate and assimilation efficiency of bacteria-free and A. tropicalis-colonized flies. We recommend that nutritional studies on Drosophila include empirical quantification of food nutrient content, to account for likely microbial-mediated effects on diet composition. More broadly, this study demonstrates that selective consumption of dietary constituents by microorganisms can alter the nutritional balance of food and, thereby, influence the nutritional status of the animal host.",2015,"Angela E Douglas, Jia-Hsin Huang"
A Drosophila Gustatory Receptor Required for Strychnine Sensation,26187906,10.1093/chemse/bjv038,"Strychnine is a potent, naturally occurring neurotoxin that effectively protects plants from animal pests by deterring feeding behavior. In insects, such as the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, bitter-tasting aversive compounds are detected primarily through a family of gustatory receptors (GRs), which are expressed in gustatory receptor neurons. We previously described multiple GRs that eliminate the behavioral avoidance to all bitter compounds tested, with the exception of strychnine. Here, we report the identity of a strychnine receptor, referred to as GR47a. We generated a mutation in Gr47a and found that it eliminated strychnine repulsion and strychnine-induced action potentials. GR47a was narrowly tuned, as the responses to other avoidance compounds were unaffected in the mutant animals. This analysis supports an emerging model that Drosophila GRs fall broadly into two specificity classes-one class is comprised of core receptors that are broadly required, whereas the other class, which includes GR47a, consists of narrowly tuned receptors that define chemical specificity.",2015,"Seok Jun Moon, Youngseok Lee, Craig Montell, Yijin Wang"

Gene expression may provide a link between variation in DNA sequence and organismal phenotypes, and its abundance can be measured efficiently and accurately. Here we quantified genome-wide variation in gene expression in the sequenced inbred lines of the Drosophila melanogaster Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP), increasing the annotated Drosophila transcriptome by 11%, including thousands of novel transcribed regions (NTRs). We found that 42% of the Drosophila transcriptome is genetically variable in males and females, including the NTRs, and is organized into modules of genetically correlated transcripts. We found that NTRs often were negatively correlated with the expression of protein-coding genes, which we exploited to annotate NTRs functionally. We identified regulatory variants for the mean and variance of gene expression, which have largely independent genetic control. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) for the mean, but not for the variance, of gene expression were concentrated near genes. Notably, the variance eQTLs often interacted epistatically with local variants in these genes to regulate gene expression. This comprehensive characterization of population-scale diversity of transcriptomes and its genetic basis in the DGRP is critically important for a systems understanding of quantitative trait variation.",2015,"Michael M Magwire, Trudy F C Mackay, Jason A Peiffer, Richard F Lyman, Robert R H Anholt, Eric A Stone, Wen Huang, Mary Anna Carbone"
Multimodal Chemosensory Circuits Controlling Male Courtship in Drosophila,26279475,10.1016/j.neuron.2015.07.025,"Throughout the animal kingdom, internal states generate long-lasting and self-perpetuating chains of behavior.

Gustatory pheromones are thought to activate P1 neurons but the circuit mechanisms that dictate their sensory responses to gate entry into courtship remain unknown. Here, we use circuit mapping and in vivo functional imaging techniques to trace gustatory and olfactory pheromone circuits to their point of convergence onto P1 neurons and reveal how their combined input underlies selective tuning to appropriate sexual partners. We identify inhibition, even in response to courtship-promoting pheromones, as a key circuit element that tunes and tempers P1 neuron activity.

Premature Sister Chromatid Separation Is Poorly Detected by the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint as a Result of System-Level Feedback,26456822,10.1016/j.celrep.2015.09.020,"Sister chromatid cohesion, mediated by the cohesin complex, is essential for faithful mitosis. Nevertheless, evidence suggests that the surveillance mechanism that governs mitotic fidelity, the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), is not robust enough to halt cell division when cohesion loss occurs prematurely. The mechanism behind this poor response is not properly understood. Using developing Drosophila brains, we show that full sister chromatid separation elicits a weak checkpoint response resulting in abnormal mitotic exit after a short delay. Quantitative live-cell imaging approaches combined with mathematical modeling indicate that weak SAC activation upon cohesion loss is caused by weak signal generation. This is further attenuated by several feedback loops in the mitotic signaling network. We propose that multiple feedback loops involving cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) gradually impair error-correction efficiency and accelerate mitotic exit upon premature loss of cohesion. Our findings explain how cohesion defects may escape SAC surveillance.",2015,"Raquel A Oliveira, Mihailo Mirkovic, Lukas H Hutter, Béla Novák"
Peptidoglycan recognition protein-triggered induction of Escherichia coli gene in Drosophila melanogaster,25577644,10.1093/jb/mvv002,"Interaction between the host and pathogen determines the fate of both organisms during the infectious state. The host is equipped with a battery of immune reactions, while the pathogen displays a variety of mechanisms to compromise host immunity. Although bacteria alter their pattern of gene expression in host organisms, studies to elucidate the mechanism behind this are only in their infancy. We here examined the possibility that host immune proteins directly participate in the change of gene expression in bacteria. Escherichia coli was treated with a mixture of the extracellular region of peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP)-LC and the antimicrobial peptide attacin of Drosophila, and subjected to DNA microarray analysis for mRNA repertoire. We identified 133 annotated genes whose mRNA increased after the treatment, and at least four of them were induced in response to PGRP-LC. One such gene, lipoprotein-encoding nlpI, showed a transient increase of mRNA in adult flies depending on PGRP-LC but not PGRP-LE. NlpI-lacking E. coli had a lowered growth rate and/or viability in flies than the parental strain.

Suppression of RNAi by dsRNA-degrading RNaseIII enzymes of viruses in animals and plants,25747942,10.1371/journal.ppat.1004711,"Certain RNA and DNA viruses that infect plants, insects, fish or poikilothermic animals encode Class 1 RNaseIII endoribonuclease-like proteins. dsRNA-specific endoribonuclease activity of the RNaseIII of rock bream iridovirus infecting fish and Sweet potato chlorotic stunt crinivirus (SPCSV) infecting plants has been shown. Suppression of the host antiviral RNA interference (RNAi) pathway has been documented with the RNaseIII of SPCSV and Heliothis virescens ascovirus infecting insects. Suppression of RNAi by the viral RNaseIIIs in non-host organisms of different kingdoms is not known. Here we expressed PPR3, the RNaseIII of Pike-perch iridovirus, in the non-hosts Nicotiana benthamiana (plant) and Caenorhabditis elegans (nematode) and found that it cleaves double-stranded small interfering RNA (ds-siRNA) molecules that are pivotal in the host RNA interference (RNAi) pathway and thereby suppresses RNAi in non-host tissues. In N. benthamiana, PPR3 enhanced accumulation of Tobacco rattle tobravirus RNA1 replicon lacking the 16K RNAi suppressor.

However, the RNaseIII (CSR3) produced by SPCSV, which cleaves ds-siRNA and counteracts antiviral RNAi in plants, failed to suppress ssRNA-mediated RNAi in C. elegans. In leaves of N. benthamiana, PPR3 suppressed RNAi induced by ssRNA and dsRNA and reversed silencing; CSR3, however, suppressed only RNAi induced by ssRNA and was unable to reverse silencing. Neither PPR3 nor CSR3 suppressed antisense-mediated RNAi in Drosophila melanogaster. These results show that the RNaseIII enzymes of RNA and DNA viruses suppress RNAi, which requires catalytic activities of RNaseIII. In contrast to other viral silencing suppression proteins, the RNaseIII enzymes are homologous in unrelated RNA and DNA viruses and can be detected in viral genomes using gene modeling and protein structure prediction programs.",2015,"Minna-Liisa Rajamäki, Rui Lu, Jari P T Valkonen, Isabel Weinheimer, Wilmer J Cuellar, Mart Saarma, Jukka Kallijärvi, Yaming Jiu, Jussi Jäntti, Carina I Holmberg, Olli Matilainen"
The Drosophila centriole - conversion of doublets into triplets within the stem cell niche,26092937,10.1242/jcs.172627,"We report, here, that two distinct centriole lineages exist in Drosophila: somatic centrioles usually composed by microtubule doublets and germ line centrioles characterized by triplets. Remarkably, the transition from doublets to triplets in the testis occurs within the stem cell niche with the formation of the C-tubule. We demonstrated that the old mother centriole, which stays in the apical cytoplasm of the male germline stem cells (GSCs), is invariably composed of triplets, whereas its daughter is always built of mixed doublets and triplets. This difference represents the first documentation of a structural asymmetry between mother and daughter centrioles in Drosophila GSCs and might reflect a correlation between the architecture of parent centrioles and their ability to recruit centrosomal proteins. We also found that the old mother centriole is linked to the cell membrane by distinct projections that might play an important role in keeping its apical position during centrosome separation.",2015,"Marco Gottardo, Giuliano Callaini, Maria Giovanna Riparbelli"
The Drosophila fragile X mental retardation protein participates in the piRNA pathway,25908854,10.1242/jcs.161810,"RNA metabolism controls multiple biological processes, and a specific class of small RNAs, called piRNAs, act as genome guardians by silencing the expression of transposons and repetitive sequences in the gonads. Defects in the piRNA pathway affect genome integrity and fertility. The possible implications in physiopathological mechanisms of human diseases have made the piRNA pathway the object of intense investigation, and recent work suggests that there is a role for this pathway in somatic processes including synaptic plasticity. The RNA-binding fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP, also known as FMR1) controls translation and its loss triggers the most frequent syndromic form of mental retardation as well as gonadal defects in humans. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that germline, as well as somatic expression, of Drosophila Fmr1 (denoted dFmr1), the Drosophila ortholog of FMRP, are necessary in a pathway mediated by piRNAs. Moreover, dFmr1 interacts genetically and biochemically with Aubergine, an Argonaute protein and a key player in this pathway. Our data provide novel perspectives for understanding the phenotypes observed in Fragile X patients and support the view that piRNAs might be at work in the nervous system.",2015,"Valeria Specchia, Celine Diebold, Maria Pia Bozzetti, Angela Giangrande, Serafina Massari, Silvia Di Tommaso, H Bahar Sahin, Pierre B Cattenoz, Antonella Friscini, Pietro Laneve, Annamaria Geusa"
Deciphering discord: How Drosophila research has enhanced our understanding of the importance of FMRP in different spatial and temporal contexts,26026973,10.1016/j.expneurol.2015.05.015,"Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the most common heritable form of intellectual impairment as well as the leading monogenetic cause of autism. In addition to its canonical definition as a neurodevelopmental disease, recent findings in the clinic suggest that FXS is a systemic disorder that is characterized by a variety of heterogeneous phenotypes. Efforts to study FXS pathogenesis have been aided by the development and characterization of animal models of the disease. Research efforts in Drosophila melanogaster have revealed key insights into the mechanistic underpinnings of FXS. While much remains unknown, it is increasingly apparent that FXS involves a myriad of spatially and temporally specific alterations in cellular function. Consequently, the literature is filled with numerous discordant findings. Researchers and clinicians alike must be cognizant of this dissonance, as it will likely be important for the design of preclinical studies to assess the efficacy of therapeutic strategies to improve the lives of FXS patients.",2015,"Thomas A Jongens, Rachel E Monyak, Eliana D Weisz"
Iron is a specific cofactor for distinct oxidation- and aggregation-dependent Aβ toxicity mechanisms in a Drosophila model,26035384,10.1242/dmm.019042,"Metals, including iron, are present at high concentrations in amyloid plaques in individuals with Alzheimer's disease, where they are also thought to be cofactors in generating oxidative stress and modulating amyloid formation. In this study, we present data from several Drosophila models of neurodegenerative proteinopathies indicating that the interaction between iron and amyloid beta peptide (Aβ) is specific and is not seen for other aggregation-prone polypeptides. The interaction with iron is likely to be important in the dimerisation of Aβ and is mediated by three N-terminal histidines. Transgenic fly lines systematically expressing all combinations of His>Ala substitutions in Aβ were generated and used to study the pathological role of these residues. Developmental eye phenotypes, longevity and histological examinations indicate that the N-terminal histidines have distinct position-dependent and -independent mechanisms. The former mediate the toxic effects of metals and Aβ aggregation under non-oxidising conditions and the latter are relevant under oxidising conditions. Understanding how Aβ mediates neurotoxic effects in vivo will help to better target pathological pathways using aggregation blockers and metal-modifying agents.",2015,"Stanislav Ott, Nikolas Dziadulewicz, Damian C Crowther"
Cortical instability drives periodic supracellular actin pattern formation in epithelial tubes,26077909,10.1073/pnas.1504762112,"An essential question of morphogenesis is how patterns arise without preexisting positional information, as inspired by Turing. In the past few years, cytoskeletal flows in the cell cortex have been identified as a key mechanism of molecular patterning at the subcellular level. Theoretical and in vitro studies have suggested that biological polymers such as actomyosin gels have the property to self-organize, but the applicability of this concept in an in vivo setting remains unclear. Here, we report that the regular spacing pattern of supracellular actin rings in the Drosophila tracheal tubule is governed by a self-organizing principle. We propose a simple biophysical model where pattern formation arises from the interplay of myosin contractility and actin turnover. We validate the hypotheses of the model using photobleaching experiments and report that the formation of actin rings is contractility dependent. Moreover, genetic and pharmacological perturbations of the physical properties of the actomyosin gel modify the spacing of the pattern, as the model predicted. In addition, our model posited a role of cortical friction in stabilizing the spacing pattern of actin rings. Consistently, genetic depletion of apical extracellular matrix caused strikingly dynamic movements of actin rings, mirroring our model prediction of a transition from steady to chaotic actin patterns at low cortical friction. Our results therefore demonstrate quantitatively that a hydrodynamical instability of the actin cortex can trigger regular pattern formation and drive morphogenesis in an in vivo setting.",2015,"Bo Dong, Jean-François Joanny, Edouard Hannezo, Pierre Recho, Shigeo Hayashi"
Remodelling of a homeobox gene cluster by multiple independent gene reunions in Drosophila,25739651,10.1038/ncomms7509,"Genome clustering of homeobox genes is often thought to reflect arrangements of tandem gene duplicates maintained by advantageous coordinated gene regulation. Here we analyse the chromosomal organization of the NK homeobox genes, presumed to be part of a single cluster in the Bilaterian ancestor, across 20 arthropods. We find that the ProtoNK cluster was extensively fragmented in some lineages, showing that NK clustering in Drosophila species does not reflect selectively maintained gene arrangements. More importantly, the arrangement of NK and neighbouring genes across the phylogeny supports that, in two instances within the Drosophila genus, some cluster remnants became reunited via large-scale chromosomal rearrangements. Simulated scenarios of chromosome evolution indicate that these reunion events are unlikely unless the genome neighbourhoods harbouring the participating genes tend to colocalize in the nucleus. Our results underscore how mechanisms other than tandem gene duplication can result in paralogous gene clustering during genome evolution.",2015,"Suvini Jayasekera, José M Ranz, Marcin von Grotthuss, Bryant Kao, Moisés Páramo, Carolus Chan"
The Drosophila Helicase Maleless (MLE) is Implicated in Functions Distinct From its Role in Dosage Compensation,25776889,10.1074/mcp.M114.040667,"Helicases are ubiquitous enzymes that unwind or remodel single or double-stranded nucleic acids, and that participate in a vast array of metabolic pathways.

Although this complex does not assemble in females, MLE is present. Given the multiplicity of functions attributed to its mammalian ortholog RNA helicase A, we have carried out an analysis for the purpose of determining whether MLE displays the same diversity. We have identified a number of different proteins that associate with MLE, implicating its role in specific pathways.

Nuclear receptors and Drosophila neuronal remodeling,24882358,10.1016/j.bbagrm.2014.05.024,"During the development of both vertebrates and invertebrates, neurons undergo a crucial remodeling process that is necessary for their new function. Neuronal remodeling is composed of two stages: first, axons and dendrites are pruned without the loss of the cell body; later, this process is most commonly followed by a regrowth step. Holometabolous insects like the fruitfly Drosophila exhibit striking differences between their larval and adult stages. These neuronal remodeling processes occur during metamorphosis, the period of transformation from a larva to an adult. All axon and dendrite pruning events ultimately depend on the EcR nuclear receptor. Its ligand, the steroid molting hormone ecdysone, binds to heteromeric receptors comprising the nuclear receptor ECR and USP, and this complex regulates target genes involved in neuronal remodeling. Here we review the nuclear receptor-mediated genetic control of the main neuronal remodeling events described so far in Drosophila. These events consist of neurite degeneration in the mushroom bodies (MBs: the brain memory center) and in the dendritic arborizing sensory neurons, of neurite retraction or small scale elimination in the thoracic ventral neurosecretory cells, in the olfactory circuits and in the neuromuscular junction. MB axon regrowth after pruning and the role of MB neuron remodeling in memory formation are also reviewed.

Morphological, physiological, and behavioral studies from many species provide detailed descriptions of the vast variation in retinal design and function.

It remains unclear, however, whether piRNA-machinery regulating ME expression functions normally under stressful conditions. The aim of this study was to explore the features of piRNA expression after heat shock (HS) exposure in Drosophila melanogaster. We also evaluated functioning of piRNA-machinery in the absence of major stress protein Hsp70 in this species. We analyzed the deep sequence data of piRNA expression after HS treatment and demonstrated that it modulates the expression of certain double-stranded germinal piRNA-clusters. Notable, we demonstrated significant changes in piRNA levels targeting a group of MEs after HS only in the strain containing normal set of hsp70 genes. Surprisingly, we failed to detect any correlation between the levels of piRNAs and the transcription of complementary MEs in the studied strains. We propose that modulation of certain piRNA-clusters expression upon HS exposure in D. melanogaster occurs due to HS-induced altering of chromatin state at certain chromosome regions.",2015,"S S Ryazansky, O G Leonova, M B Evgen'ev, S Yu Funikov, D G Garbuz, E S Zelentsova, O G Zatsepina, V I Popenko"
Inhibition of Daughterless by Extramacrochaetae mediates Notch-induced cell proliferation,25977368,10.1242/dev.121855,"During development, the rate of cell proliferation must be constantly monitored so that an individual tissue achieves its correct size. Mutations in genes that normally promote tissue growth often result in undersized, disorganized and non-functional organs. However, mutations in genes that encode growth inhibitors can trigger the onset of tumorigenesis and cancer. The developing eye of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, has become a premier model system for studies that are focused on identifying the molecular mechanisms that underpin growth control. Here, we examine the mechanism by which the Notch pathway, a major contributor to growth, promotes cell proliferation in the developing eye. Current models propose that the Notch pathway directly influences cell proliferation by regulating growth-promoting genes such as four-jointed, cyclin D1 and E2f1. Here, we show that, in addition to these mechanisms, some Notch signaling is devoted to blocking the growth-suppressing activity of the bHLH DNA-binding protein Daughterless (Da). We demonstrate that Notch signaling activates the expression of extramacrochaetae (emc), which encodes a helix-loop-helix (HLH) transcription factor. Emc, in turn, then forms a biochemical complex with Da. As Emc lacks a basic DNA-binding domain, the Emc-Da heterodimer cannot bind to and regulate genomic targets. One effect of Da sequestration is to relieve the repression on growth. Here, we present data supporting our model that Notch-induced cell proliferation in the developing eye is mediated in part by the activity of Emc.",2015,"Carrie M Spratford, Justin P Kumar"
An image database of Drosophila melanogaster wings for phenomic and biometric analysis,27390931,10.1186/s13742-015-0065-6,"Background: Extracting important descriptors and features from images of biological specimens is an ongoing challenge. Features are often defined using landmarks and semi-landmarks that are determined a priori based on criteria such as homology or some other measure of biological significance. An alternative, widely used strategy uses computational pattern recognition, in which features are acquired from the image de novo. Subsets of these features are then selected based on objective criteria. Computational pattern recognition has been extensively developed primarily for the classification of samples into groups, whereas landmark methods have been broadly applied to biological inference. Results: To compare these approaches and to provide a general community resource, we have constructed an image database of Drosophila melanogaster wings - individually identifiable and organized by sex, genotype and replicate imaging system - for the development and testing of measurement and classification tools for biological images. We have used this database to evaluate the relative performance of current classification strategies. Several supervised parametric and nonparametric machine learning algorithms were used on principal components extracted from geometric morphometric shape data (landmarks and semi-landmarks). For comparison, we also classified phenotypes based on de novo features extracted from wing images using several computer vision and pattern recognition methods as implemented in the Bioimage Classification and Annotation Tool (BioCAT). Conclusions: Because we were able to thoroughly evaluate these strategies using the publicly available Drosophila wing database, we believe that this resource will facilitate the development and testing of new tools for the measurement and classification of complex biological phenotypes.",2015,"Sudarshan Chari, William R Pitchers, Ian Dworkin, David VanderZee, Anne Sonnenschein"
Ecdysone signalling and ovarian development in insects: from stem cells to ovarian follicle formation,24939835,10.1016/j.bbagrm.2014.05.025,"Although a great deal of information is available concerning the role of ecdysone in insect oogenesis, research has tended to focus on vitellogenesis and choriogenesis. As such, the study of oogenesis in a strict sense has received much less attention. This situation changed recently when a number of observations carried out in the meroistic polytrophic ovarioles of Drosophila melanogaster started to unravel the key roles played by ecdysone in different steps of oogenesis. Thus, in larval stages, a non-autonomous role of ecdysone, first in repression and later in activation, of stem cell niche and primordial germ cell differentiation has been reported. In the adult, ecdysone stimulates the proliferation of germline stem cells, plays a role in stem cell niche maintenance and is needed non-cell-autonomously for correct differentiation of germline stem cells. Moreover, in somatic cells ecdysone is required for 16-cell cyst formation and for ovarian follicle development. In the transition from stages 8 to 9 of oogenesis, ecdysone signalling is fundamental when deciding whether or not to go ahead with vitellogenesis depending on the nutritional status, as well as to start border cell migration.

Host Genetic Control of the Microbiota Mediates the Drosophila Nutritional Phenotype,26567306,10.1128/AEM.03301-15,"A wealth of studies has demonstrated that resident microorganisms (microbiota) influence the pattern of nutrient allocation to animal protein and energy stores, but it is unclear how the effects of the microbiota interact with other determinants of animal nutrition, including animal genetic factors and diet. Here, we demonstrate that members of the gut microbiota in Drosophila melanogaster mediate the effect of certain animal genetic determinants on an important nutritional trait, triglyceride (lipid) content. Parallel analysis of the taxonomic composition of the associated bacterial community and host nutritional indices (glucose, glycogen, triglyceride, and protein contents) in multiple Drosophila genotypes revealed significant associations between the abundance of certain microbial taxa, especially Acetobacteraceae and Xanthamonadaceae, and host nutritional phenotype. By a genome-wide association study of Drosophila lines colonized with a defined microbiota, multiple host genes were statistically associated with the abundance of one bacterium, Acetobacter tropicalis. Experiments using mutant Drosophila validated the genetic association evidence and reveal that host genetic control of microbiota abundance affects the nutritional status of the flies. These data indicate that the abundance of the resident microbiota is influenced by host genotype, with consequent effects on nutrient allocation patterns, demonstrating that host genetic control of the microbiome contributes to the genotype-phenotype relationship of the animal host.",2015,"John M Chaston, Adam J Dobson, Angela E Douglas, Peter D Newell"
An Asp-CaM complex is required for centrosome-pole cohesion and centrosome inheritance in neural stem cells,26620907,10.1083/jcb.201509054,"The interaction between centrosomes and mitotic spindle poles is important for efficient spindle formation, orientation, and cell polarity. However, our understanding of the dynamics of this relationship and implications for tissue homeostasis remains poorly understood. Here we report that Drosophila melanogaster calmodulin (CaM) regulates the ability of the microcephaly-associated protein, abnormal spindle (Asp), to cross-link spindle microtubules. Both proteins colocalize on spindles and move toward spindle poles, suggesting that they form a complex. Our binding and structure-function analysis support this hypothesis. Disruption of the Asp-CaM interaction alone leads to unfocused spindle poles and centrosome detachment. This behavior leads to randomly inherited centrosomes after neuroblast division. We further show that spindle polarity is maintained in neuroblasts despite centrosome detachment, with the poles remaining stably associated with the cell cortex. Finally, we provide evidence that CaM is required for Asp's spindle function; however, it is completely dispensable for Asp's role in microcephaly suppression.",2015,"Todd Schoborg, Allison L Zajac, Carey J Fagerstrom, Rodrigo X Guillen, Nasser M Rusan"
The transcription factor Cabut coordinates energy metabolism and the circadian clock in response to sugar sensing,25916830,10.15252/embj.201591385,"Nutrient sensing pathways adjust metabolism and physiological functions in response to food intake. For example, sugar feeding promotes lipogenesis by activating glycolytic and lipogenic genes through the Mondo/ChREBP-Mlx transcription factor complex. Concomitantly, other metabolic routes are inhibited, but the mechanisms of transcriptional repression upon sugar sensing have remained elusive. Here, we characterize cabut (cbt), a transcription factor responsible for the repressive branch of the sugar sensing transcriptional network in Drosophila. We demonstrate that cbt is rapidly induced upon sugar feeding through direct regulation by Mondo-Mlx. We found that CBT represses several metabolic targets in response to sugar feeding, including both isoforms of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (pepck). Deregulation of pepck1 (CG17725) in mlx mutants underlies imbalance of glycerol and glucose metabolism as well as developmental lethality. Furthermore, we demonstrate that cbt provides a regulatory link between nutrient sensing and the circadian clock.

Comparison of larval and adult Drosophila astrocytes reveals stage-specific gene expression profiles,25653313,10.1534/g3.114.016162,"The analysis of adult astrocyte glial cells has revealed a remarkable heterogeneity with regard to morphology, molecular signature, and physiology. A key question in glial biology is how such heterogeneity arises during brain development. One approach to this question is to identify genes with differential astrocyte expression during development; certain genes expressed later in neural development may contribute to astrocyte differentiation. We have utilized the Drosophila model and Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification (TRAP)-RNA-seq methods to derive the genome-wide expression profile of Drosophila larval astrocyte-like cells (hereafter referred to as astrocytes) for the first time. These studies identified hundreds of larval astrocyte-enriched genes that encode proteins important for metabolism, energy production, and protein synthesis, consistent with the known role of astrocytes in the metabolic support of neurons. Comparison of the larval profile with that observed for adults has identified genes with astrocyte-enriched expression specific to adulthood. These include genes important for metabolism and energy production, translation, chromatin modification, protein glycosylation, neuropeptide signaling, immune responses, vesicle-mediated trafficking or secretion, and the regulation of behavior. Among these functional classes, the expression of genes important for chromatin modification and vesicle-mediated trafficking or secretion is overrepresented in adult astrocytes based on Gene Ontology analysis. Certain genes with selective adult enrichment may mediate functions specific to this stage or may be important for the differentiation or maintenance of adult astrocytes, with the latter perhaps contributing to population heterogeneity.",2015,"F Rob Jackson, Fanny S Ng, Yanmei Huang"
The COOH terminus of synaptotagmin mediates interaction with the neurexins,8132583,,"The interaction of the synaptic vesicle protein, synaptotagmin, and the presynaptic alpha-latrotoxin receptor, a neurexin, has been proposed to be involved in docking of synaptic vesicles at active sites or modulation of neurotransmitter release. Here I report the investigation of the domain of synaptotagmin responsible for this interaction. Pieces of synaptotagmin containing the carboxyl terminus are capable of purifying neurexins from solubilized brain homogenates. Pieces as small as a synthesized peptide corresponding to the COOH-terminal 34 amino acids are capable of enriching neurexins 100-fold. The binding of neurexins to synaptotagmin is calcium-independent and of moderate affinity. This COOH-terminal segment of synaptotagmin is conserved in all species characterized to date. Reflective of this, a synthetic peptide corresponding to the carboxyl terminus of Drosophila synaptotagmin is capable of purification of rat neurexins, suggesting the possibility that this interaction may also exist in Drosophila. I propose that the carboxyl terminus of synaptotagmin binds to the carboxyl terminus of the neurexins and that this interaction may mediate docking of synaptic vesicles or modulation of neurotransmitter release.",1994,M S Perin

The prevalence of cactophilic yeasts including Pichia barkeri, Candida sonorensis and Geotrichum sp. in the crops and external surfaces of D. serido reflected its association with the cactus habitat. The effective number of yeasts vectored on the surface of flies was higher than that in the crops. Also overlap between the yeasts from stems and from crops was partial suggesting selective feeding by the flies in the substrates visited. The females had a higher effective number of yeast species and a lower similarity than males with the yeast community of P. arrabidae. This was probably related to the search for oviposition sites by females. The presence of Pichia thermotolerans-like and Pichia amethionina var pachycereana in the flies, but not in P. arrabidae stems, indicated that D. serido was not limited to this cactus species. The larvae and adults lived in different patches with the adults feeding in patches with higher yeast species richness. The larvae had a narrower feeding niche and higher overlap with P. arrabidae, and preferred P. barkeri and Pichia cactophila as food. Adult flies fed on patches with the most frequent yeasts except for P. cactophila. Pichia caribaea was found in higher frequency in the adult crops than in the stems.

This gene maps to the 46C region of chromosome 2R; this interval previously was not well characterized. For this genetic and molecular analysis, we have used X-ray mutagenesis, EMS mutagenesis, and the recently reported local P element transposition method. We identified four overlapping deletions, two of which have proximal breakpoints that define a 50-60-kb region surrounding the FMRFamide gene in 46C. To this small region, we mapped three lethal complementation groups; 10 additional lethal complementation groups were mapped to more distal regions of 46CD. One of these groups corresponds to even-skipped, the other 12 are previously unidentified. Using various lines of evidence we excluded the possibility that FMRFamide corresponds to any of the three lethal complementation groups mapping to its immediate 50-60-kb vicinity. The positions of two of the three lethal complementation groups were identified with P elements using a local transposition scheme. The third lethal complementation group was excluded as being FMRFamide mutants by sequence analysis and by immunocytochemistry with proFMRFamide precursor-specific antibodies. This analysis has (1) provided a genetic map of the 46CD chromosomal region and a detailed molecular map of a portion of the 46C region and (2) provided additional evidence of the utility of local transposition for targeting nearby genes.",1994,"M A O'Brien, P H Taghert, M S Roberts"

Fundamental molecular differences between alcohol dehydrogenase classes,8197167,10.1073/pnas.91.11.4980,"Two types of alcohol dehydrogenase in separate protein families are the ""medium-chain"" zinc enzymes (including the classical liver and yeast forms) and the ""short-chain"" enzymes (including the insect form). Although the medium-chain family has been characterized in prokaryotes and many eukaryotes (fungi, plants, cephalopods, and vertebrates), insects have seemed to possess only the short-chain enzyme. We have now also characterized a medium-chain alcohol dehydrogenase in Drosophila. The enzyme is identical to insect octanol dehydrogenase. It is a typical class III alcohol dehydrogenase, similar to the corresponding human form (70% residue identity), with mostly the same residues involved in substrate and coenzyme interactions. Changes that do occur are conservative, but Phe-51 is of functional interest in relation to decreased coenzyme binding and increased overall activity. Extra residues versus the human enzyme near position 250 affect the coenzyme-binding domain. Enzymatic properties are similar--i.e., very low activity toward ethanol (Km beyond measurement) and high selectivity for formaldehyde/glutathione (S-hydroxymethylglutathione; kcat/Km = 160,000 min-1.mM-1). Between the present class III and the ethanol-active class I enzymes, however, patterns of variability differ greatly, highlighting fundamentally separate molecular properties of these two alcohol dehydrogenases, with class III resembling enzymes in general and class I showing high variation. The gene coding for the Drosophila class III enzyme produces an mRNA of about 1.36 kb that is present at all developmental stages of the fly, compatible with the constitutive nature of the vertebrate enzyme. Taken together, the results bridge a previously apparent gap in the distribution of medium-chain alcohol dehydrogenases and establish a strictly conserved class III enzyme, consistent with an important role for this enzyme in cellular metabolism.",1994,"L Hjelmqvist, O Danielsson, T Luque, H Jörnvall, S Atrian, R Gonzàlez-Duarte"
"A defective non-LTR retrotransposon is dispersed throughout the genome of the silkworm, Bombyx mori",7821086,10.1007/BF00417878,"The presence of long repetitive sequences is demonstrated in the genome of the silkworm, Bombyx mori. Members of this BMC1 family reveal several features typical of the L1 (long interspersed sequence one) family of mammals, except for species specific elements. The number of BMC1 elements is estimated to be approximately 3500 per haploid genome. Elements containing the full length unit of 5.1 kb are dispersed throughout the genome and their restriction sites are conserved, although most members are preferentially truncated to varying extents at their 5' ends. DNA sequencing indicates that this element contains six tandem repeats of 15 bp CpG-rich sequence in the 5' proximal region. It terminates with a 3' oligo(A) stretch, and is flanked at both ends by a 7-10 bp target sequence duplication. In addition, there is significant evidence for amino acid sequence homology with reverse transcriptase domains of other L1 families, especially F, Doc and Jockey of Drosophila melanogaster. No large open reading frame is present. The BMC1 element is suggested to be dispersed in the genome by a transposition mechanism involving RNA intermediates.",1994,"S Tomino, H Maekawa, S Izumi, K Tsuchida, N Miyajima, T Ogura, N Takada, K Okano, H Tanaka"
"Molecular characterization and tissue distribution of ZO-2, a tight junction protein homologous to ZO-1 and the Drosophila discs-large tumor suppressor protein",8132716,10.1083/jcb.124.6.949,"ZO-1 is a 210-225-kD peripheral membrane protein associated with cytoplasmic surfaces of the zonula occludens or tight junction. A 160-kD polypeptide, designated ZO-2, was found to coimmunoprecipitate with ZO-1 from MDCK cell extracts prepared under conditions which preserve protein associations (Gumbiner, B., T. Lowenkopf, and D. Apatira. 1991. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 88: 3460-3464). We have isolated ZO-2 from MDCK cell monolayers by bulk coimmunoprecipitation with ZO-1 followed by electroelution from preparative SDS-PAGE gel slices. Amino acid sequence information obtained from a ZO-2 tryptic fragment was used to isolate a partial cDNA clone from an MDCK library. The deduced amino acid sequence revealed that canine ZO-2 contains a region that is very similar to sequences in human and mouse ZO-1. This region includes both a 90-amino acid repeat domain of unknown function and guanylate kinase-like domains which are shared among members of the family of proteins that includes ZO-1, erythrocyte p55, the product of the lethal(1)discs-large-1 (dlg) gene of Drosophila, and a synapse-associated protein from rat brain, PSD-95/SAP90. The dlg gene product has been shown to act as a tumor suppressor in the imaginal disc of the Drosophila larva, although the functions of other family members have not yet been defined. A polyclonal antiserum was raised against a unique region of ZO-2 and found to exclusively label the cytoplasmic surfaces of tight junctions in MDCK plasma membrane preparations, indicating that ZO-2 is a tight junction-associated protein. Immunohistochemical staining of frozen sections of whole tissue demonstrated that ZO-2 localized to the region of the tight junction in a number of epithelia, including liver, intestine, kidney, testis, and arterial endothelium, suggesting that this protein is a ubiquitous component of the tight junction. Double-label immunofluorescence microscopy performed on cryosections of heart, a nonepithelial tissue, revealed the presence of ZO-1 but no ZO-2 staining at the fascia adherens, a specialized junction of cardiac myocytes which has previously been shown to contain ZO-1 (Itoh, M., S. Yonemura, A. Nagafuchi, S. Tsukita, and Sh. Tsukita. 1991. J. Cell Biol. 115:1449-1462).

The Drosophila lethal(2)giant larvae tumor suppressor protein forms homo-oligomers and is associated with nonmuscle myosin II heavy chain,7962095,10.1083/jcb.127.5.1361,"Inactivation of the Drosophila lethal(2)giant larvae (l(2)gl) gene causes malignant tumors in the brain and the imaginal discs and produces developmental abnormalities in other tissues, including the germline, the ring gland and the salivary glands. Our investigations into the l(2)gl function have revealed that the gene product, or p127 protein, acts as a cytoskeletal protein distributed in both the cytoplasm and on the inner face of lateral cell membranes in a number of tissues throughout development. To determine whether p127 can form oligomers or can stably interact with other proteins we have analyzed the structure of the cytosolic form of p127. Using gel filtration and immunoaffinity chromatography we found that p127 is consistently recovered as high molecular weight complexes that contain predominantly p127 and at least ten additional proteins. Blot overlay assays indicated that p127 can form homo-oligomers and the use of a series of chimaeric proteins made of segments of p127 fused to protein A, which alone behaves as a monomer, showed that p127 contains at least three distinct domains contributing to its homo-oligomerization. Among the proteins separated from the immuno-purified p127 complexes or isolated by virtue of their affinity to p127, we identified one of the proteins by microsequencing as nonmuscle myosin II heavy chain. Further blot overlay assay showed that p127 can directly interact with nonmuscle myosin II. These findings confirm that p127 is a component of a cytoskeletal network including myosin and suggest that the neoplastic transformation resulting from l(2)gl gene inactivation may be caused by the partial disruption of this network.",1994,"R Jakobs, H W Heid, B Neumann, A Kalmes, G Merdes, I Husmann, D Strand, B M Mechler"
Genetic dissection of consolidated memory in Drosophila,7923375,10.1016/0092-8674(94)90398-0,"Behavioral and pharmacological experiments in many animal species have suggested that memory is consolidated from an initial, disruptable form into a long-lasting, stable form within a few hours after training. We combined these traditional approaches with genetic analyses in Drosophila to show that consolidated memory of conditioned (learned) odor avoidance 1 day after extended training consisted of two genetically distinct, functionally independent memory components: anesthesia-resistant memory (ARM) and long-term memory (LTM). ARM decayed away within 4 days, was resistant to hypothermic disruption, was insensitive to the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CXM), and was disrupted by the radish single-gene mutation. LTM showed no appreciable decay over 7 days, was sensitive to CXM, and was not disrupted by the radish mutation.",1994,"S C Boynton, T Preat, M Del Vecchio, T Tully"
Ion permeation properties of the glutamate receptor channel in cultured embryonic Drosophila myotubes,7519261,,"Ion permeation properties of the glutamate receptor channel in cultured myotubes of Drosophila embryos were studied using the inside-out configuration of the patch-clamp technique. Lowering the NaCl concentration in the bath (intracellular solution), while maintaining that of the external solution constant, caused a shift of the reversal potential in the positive direction, thus indicating a higher permeability of the channel to Na+ than to Cl- (PCl/PNa < 0.04), and suggesting that the channel is cation selective. With 145 mM Na+ on both sides of the membrane, the single-channel current-voltage relation was almost linear in the voltage range between -80 and +80 mV, the conductance showing some variability in the range between 140 and 170 pS. All monovalent alkali cations tested, as well as NH4+, permeated the channel effectively. Using the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation for the reversal potential, the permeability ratios with respect to Na+ were estimated to be: 1.32 for K+, 1.18 for NH4+, 1.15 for Rb+, 1.09 for Cs+, and 0.57 for Li+. Divalent cations, i.e. Mg2+ and Ca2+, in the external solution depressed not only the inward but also the outward Na+ currents, although reversal potential measurements indicated that both ions have considerably higher permeabilities than Na+ (PMg/PNa = 2.31; PCa/PNa = 9.55). The conductance-activity relation for Na+ was described by a hyperbolic curve. The maximal conductance was about 195 pS and the half-saturating activity 45 mM. This result suggests that Na+ ions bind to sites in the channel. All data were fitted by a model based on the Eyring's reaction rate theory, in which the receptor channel is a one-ion pore with three energy barriers and two internal sites.",1994,"Y Kidokoro, S Ciani, H Chang"
"HMG-D, the Drosophila melanogaster homologue of HMG 1 protein, is associated with early embryonic chromatin in the absence of histone H1",8168480,,"We show that HMG-D, an abundant chromosomal protein, is associated with condensed chromatin structures during the first six nuclear cleavage cycles of the developing Drosophila embryo and that histone H1 is absent from these same structures. As H1 accumulates from nuclear division 7 onwards, the nuclei become more compact and transcriptionally active. This compaction is paralleled by a reduction in size of mitotic chromatin. In addition, we find a striking correlation between the switch in HMG-D:H1 ratios and the changes that occur between nuclear cycles 8 and 13 that are collectively termed the mid-blastula transition. This transition is characterized by an increase in the nuclear cycle times, a change in the nucleo-cytoplasmic ratio, and a 5- to 20-fold decrease in nuclear volume. We propose that this is a direct consequence of a re-organization of chromatin from a less condensed state with HMG-D to a more condensed state with H1. We argue that HMG-D, either by itself or in conjunction with other chromosomal proteins, induces a condensed state of chromatin that is distinct from, and less compact than the H1-containing 30 nm fibre and that this state of chromatin could facilitate rapid nuclear cycles.",1994,"A A Travers, S S Ner"
Mariner-like elements in hymenopteran species: insertion site and distribution,8159761,10.1073/pnas.91.8.3408,"Copies of mariner-like element (MLE) transposons in two species, the bumble bee, Bombus terrestris, and the ant, Myrmica ruginodis, were sequenced.

The five copies sequenced were approximately 75% similar to a mariner element (peach) of Drosophila mauritiana. The distribution of MLE in 27 hymenopteran species was studied by PCR and Southern blot hybridization; 93% of the species contained one or more of the four major forms of the element. They are inserted in their host genomes, in the middle of a degenerated 30-bp palindrome, which is itself located in an 85-bp conserved region with a purine-rich tail at one of its ends. The hymenopteran MLEs lie in a specific insertion site, suggesting that this region is conserved. It is thus possible that this region may be a selectively neutral insertion site, which would explain why these elements are widespread in hymenopteran genomes and are not eliminated by male haploidy.",1994,"Y Bigot, P Capy, G Periquet, M H Hamelin"
Cloning of a Drosophila melanogaster homologue of the mouse type-I bone morphogenetic proteins-2/-4 receptor: a potential decapentaplegic receptor,7958946,10.1016/0378-1119(94)90690-4,"The Drosophila melanogaster (Dm) decapentaplegic (dpp) gene product plays an essential role during several stages of Dm development. The DPP protein is a member of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily and an orthologue of mammalian bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP-2 and -4). Recently, a cDNA clone encoding the mouse Ser/Thr kinase receptor specific for BMP-2/-4 (mTFR11) was isolated. Here, we describe the deduced primary structure, the cytogenetic position and expression pattern of the Dm homologue of mTFR11 (DTFR), a putative DPP receptor. The cytogenetic position of the Dm dtfr gene was mapped to 25D. DTFR has striking homology to mTFR11, especially in the cytoplasmic domain (approx. 63%), including a Ser + Gly-rich box that is characteristic of type-I receptors for the TGF-beta superfamily. Although the amino acid (aa) sequence of the extracellular domain is less conserved than that of the cytoplasmic domain, the extracellular domains of these two molecules were more homologous (approx. 27%) to each other than any other receptors for the TGF-beta superfamily. The spacing of Cys residues in the extracellular domain, which is considered crucial to ligand specificity, is highly conserved in these two receptors.

A full-length clone encodes a protein of 761 amino acids with an estimated size of 87 kDa. Sequences of eight peptides from purified pig intestinal mucosa cGK II were found in the derived amino acid sequence of this clone, identifying it as rat intestinal cGK II. Phylogenetic analysis showed that rat intestinal cGK II is less related to mammalian cGK I than to the Drosophila DG1 gene product and most closely related to a recently cloned mouse brain CGKII isoform. Like several other cGK sequences, that of cGK II contained a leucine/isoleucine heptad repeat motif that has been implicated in dimer formation in cGK I. Expression of cGK II cDNA in HEK 293 cells followed by subcellular fractionation revealed cGK II localization in the cell particulate fraction, consistent with the membrane association of endogenous rat cGK II. On Northern blots, the major cGK II poly(A) RNA form was 4.8 kb, with minor forms of 6.2 and 3.1 kb. The cGK II RNA was highly expressed in rat intestinal mucosa and was 20 times less abundant in rat brain and kidney.

Identification of a strong transcriptional activator for the copia retrotransposon responsible for its differential expression in Drosophila hydei and melanogaster cell lines,8074683,10.1006/bbrc.1994.2195,"We have characterized the regulatory properties of a 72bp sequence located in the 5' untranslated domain of the Drosophila copia retrotransposon, 3' to the left LTR, by transient transfection assays with cell lines derived from either Drosophila hydei (DH33 cells) or Drosophila melanogaster (Schneider II and Kc cells). Reporter plasmids were constructed which contained the lacZ gene under the control of either the entire copia LTR with 5' untranslated domain, or a minimal heterologous promoter flanked with the identified copia regulatory sequences. Upon transfection into the copia-free DH33 cells, the presence of the 72bp sequence resulted for all reporter plasmids in a 100-700 fold increase in expression level -as well as in reporter gene RNA levels- whereas this sequence had no enhancing effect upon transfection of the same plasmids into the copia-containing Schneider II or Kc cells. Moreover, mobility shift assays with the 72bp enhancer sequence disclosed two specific bands of retarded mobility with whole-cell extracts from DH33 cells, whereas no retarded band could be detected, under identical conditions, with extracts from Schneider II cells. UV crosslinking experiments between the enhancer sequence and DH33 extracts revealed a single protein species -of app. mol. wt. 50kD- for both retarded bands, thus strongly suggesting that they simply correspond to the sequential binding of two identical factor molecules to the enhancer sequence. These data demonstrate that the copia-free D. hydei cells express a strong transcriptional activator for the copia element and possible interpretations for the absence of this factor in the copia-containing D. melanogaster cells are discussed in terms of a possible ""adaptation"" of the ""host"" (D. melanogaster) to an otherwise highly mutagenic ""parasite"" (copia with its transcription factor).",1994,"T Heidmann, S Jensen, L Cavarec"

Reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) shows that tubules express those genes encoding components of the Imd pathway. Furthermore, isolated tubules bind and respond to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), by upregulating anti-microbial peptide (diptericin) gene expression and increased bacterial killing. Excised, LPS-challenged tubules, as well as tubules from LPS-infected flies, display increased NO synthase (NOS) activity upon immune challenge. Targetted expression of a Drosophila NOS (dNOS) transgene to only principal cells of the tubule main segment using the GAL4/UAS system increases diptericin expression. In live flies, such targetted over-expression of dNOS to tubule principal cells confers increased survival of the whole animal upon E. coli challenge.

GATA factors as key regulatory molecules in the development of Drosophila endoderm,16316403,10.1111/j.1440-169X.2005.00836.x,"Essential roles for GATA factors in the development of endoderm have been reported in various animals. A Drosophila GATA factor gene, serpent (srp, dGATAb, ABF), is expressed in the prospective endoderm, and loss of srp activity causes transformation of the prospective endoderm into ectodermal foregut and hindgut, indicating that srp acts as a selector gene to specify the developmental fate of the endoderm. While srp is expressed in the endoderm only during early stages, it activates a subsequent GATA factor gene, dGATAe, and the latter continues to be expressed specifically in the endoderm throughout life. dGATAe activates various functional genes in the differentiated endodermal midgut. An analogous mode of regulation has been reported in Caenorhabditis elegans, in which a pair of GATA genes, end-1/3, specifies endodermal fate, and a downstream pair of GATA genes, elt-2/7, activates genes in the differentiated endoderm. Functional homology of GATA genes in nature is apparently extendable to vertebrates, because endodermal GATA genes of C. elegans and Drosophila induce endoderm development in Xenopus ectoderm.

However, AmEPV carries a single inhibitor of apoptosis (iap) gene (AMViap) not present in vertebrate poxviruses. The AMViap gene was active when coexpressed with the Drosophila proapoptotic gene hid in Ld652 cells and can rescue cells from apoptosis as shown by increased number of surviving cells and reduced levels of caspase-3-like activity. We also showed that expression of the AMViap gene rescued polyhedron production in Autographa californica M nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV)Deltap35-infected Sf9 cells during an otherwise abortive infection induced by apoptosis. Surprisingly, deletion of the AMViap gene from the AmEPV genome led to only a modest (10-fold) loss of virion production in infected Ld652 cells, indicating that the AMViap gene is nonessential for virus replication under these conditions. However, infection of Ld652 cells by AmEPV lacking a functional iap gene led to a more rapid induction of cytotoxicity and increased levels of caspase-3-like activity. Similar results were observed and were more pronounced in infected Sf9 and S2 cells. The purified AMVIAP protein also inhibits the enzymatic activities of human caspase-9 and caspase-3 in vitro.

Morphogens in motion: growth control of the neural tube,16041754,10.1002/neu.20169,"The entire vertebrate nervous system develops from a simple epithelial sheet, the neural plate which, along development, acquires the large number and wide variety of neuronal cell types required for the construction of a functional mature nervous system.

Pattern formation, particularly in the vertebrate central nervous system, is one of the best examples of a morphogen-type of function. Cell cycle progression, however, is generally accepted to be dependent on cell-intrinsic factors. Recent studies have demonstrated that proliferation of neural precursors is also somehow controlled by secreted signaling molecules, well-known by their role as morphogens, such as fibroblast growth factor (FGF), vertebrate orthologs of the Drosophila wingless (Wnt), hedgehog (Hh), and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) families, that in turn regulate the activity of factors controlling cell cycle progression.

We cloned a novel Drosophila KCNQ channel (dKCNQ) based on its sequence homology to the mammalian genes. When expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, dKCNQ gives rise to a slowly activating and slowly deactivating current that activates in the subthreshold voltage range. Like the M-current produced by mammalian KCNQ channels, dKCNQ current is sensitive to the KCNQ-specific blocker linopirdine and is suppressed by activation of a muscarinic receptor. dKCNQ is also similar to the mammalian channels in that it binds calmodulin (CaM), and CaM binding is necessary to produce functional currents. In situ hybridization analysis demonstrates that dKCNQ mRNA is present in brain cortical neurons, the cardia (proventriculus), and the nurse cells and oocytes of the ovary. We generated mutant flies with deletions in the genomic sequence of dKCNQ.

Pair rule gene orthologs in spider segmentation,16336415,10.1111/j.1525-142X.2005.05065.x,"The activation of pair rule genes is the first indication of the metameric organization of the Drosophila embryo and thus forms a key step in the segmentation process. There are two classes of pair rule genes in Drosophila: the primary pair rule genes that are directly activated by the maternal and gap genes and the secondary pair rule genes that rely on input from the primary pair rule genes. Here we analyze orthologs of Drosophila primary and secondary pair rule orthologs in the spider Cupiennius salei. The expression patterns of the spider pair rule gene orthologs can be subdivided in three groups: even-skipped and runt-1 expression is in stripes that start at the posterior end of the growth zone and their expression ends before the stripes reach the anterior end of the growth zone, while hairy and pairberry-3 stripes also start at the posterior end, but do not cease in the anterior growth zone. Stripes of odd-paired, odd-skipped-related-1, and sloppy paired are only found in the anterior portion of the growth zone. The various genes thus seem to be active during different phases of segment specification. It is notable that the spider orthologs of the Drosophila primary pair rule genes are active more posterior in the growth zone and thus during earlier phases of segment specification than most orthologs of Drosophila secondary pair rule genes, indicating that parts of the hierarchy might be conserved between flies and spiders. The spider ortholog of the Drosophila pair rule gene fushi tarazu is not expressed in the growth zone, but is expressed in a Hox-like fashion. The segmentation function of fushi tarazu thus appears to be a newly acquired role of the gene in the lineage of the mandibulate arthropods.",2005,"Nikola-Michael Prpic, Ralf Janssen, Wim G M Damen"
The EH1 motif in metazoan transcription factors,16309560,10.1186/1471-2164-6-169,"Background: The Engrailed Homology 1 (EH1) motif is a small region, believed to have evolved convergently in homeobox and forkhead containing proteins, that interacts with the Drosophila protein groucho (C. elegans unc-37, Human Transducin-like Enhancers of Split). The small size of the motif makes its reliable identification by computational means difficult. I have systematically searched the predicted proteomes of Drosophila, C. elegans and human for further instances of the motif. Results: Using motif identification methods and database searching techniques, I delimit which homeobox and forkhead domain containing proteins also have likely EH1 motifs. I show that despite low database search scores, there is a significant association of the motif with transcription factor function. I further show that likely EH1 motifs are found in combination with T-Box, Zinc Finger and Doublesex domains as well as discussing other plausible candidate associations. I identify strong candidate EH1 motifs in basal metazoan phyla. Conclusion: Candidate EH1 motifs exist in combination with a variety of transcription factor domains, suggesting that these proteins have repressor functions. The distribution of the EH1 motif is suggestive of convergent evolution, although in many cases, the motif has been conserved throughout bilaterian orthologs. Groucho mediated repression was established prior to the evolution of bilateria.",2005,Richard R Copley
PAT-related amino acid transporters regulate growth via a novel mechanism that does not require bulk transport of amino acids,15843412,10.1242/dev.01821,"Growth in normal and tumour cells is regulated by evolutionarily conserved extracellular inputs from the endocrine insulin receptor (InR) signalling pathway and by local nutrients. Both signals modulate activity of the intracellular TOR kinase, with nutrients at least partly acting through changes in intracellular amino acid levels mediated by amino acid transporters. We show that in Drosophila, two molecules related to mammalian proton-assisted SLC36 amino acid transporters (PATs), CG3424 and CG1139, are potent mediators of growth. These transporters genetically interact with TOR and other InR signalling components, indicating that they control growth by directly or indirectly modulating the effects of TOR signalling. A mutation in the CG3424 gene, which we have named pathetic (path), reduces growth in the fly. In a heterologous Xenopus oocyte system, PATH also activates the TOR target S6 kinase in an amino acid-dependent way. However, functional analysis reveals that PATH has an extremely low capacity and an exceptionally high affinity compared with characterised human PATs and the CG1139 transporter. PATH and potentially other PAT-related transporters must therefore control growth via a mechanism that does not require bulk transport of amino acids into the cell. As PATH is likely to be saturated in vivo, we propose that one specialised function of high-affinity PAT-related molecules is to maintain growth as local nutrient levels fluctuate during development.",2005,"David Meredith, Clive Wilson, C A Richard Boyd, Deborah C I Goberdhan"

The 15,521-bp-long G. orientalis mitogenome contains typical gene complement, base composition, and codon usage found in metazoan mitogenomes. The G. orientalis mitogenome contains the third lowest A+T content (70.5%) among the complete insects mt genome sequences. The initiation codon for the G. orientalis COI gene appears to be ATG, instead of the tetranucleotides, which have been postulated to act as initiation codon for Locusta migratoria and some lepidopteran COI genes. The initiation codon for ND2 appears to be GTG, which is rare, but has been designated as an initiator of Tricholepidion gertschi ND2. All anticodons of G. orientalis tRNAs were identical to Drosophila yakuba and L. migratoria. The tRNA(Ser)(AGN) could not form a stable stem loop structure in the DHU arm as shown in many other insect tRNA(Ser)(AGN). Phylogenetic analysis of nucleotide sequence information from all mt genes supported a monophyletic Diptera, a monophyletic Lepidoptera, a monophyletic Coleoptera, a monophyletic Mecopterida (Diptera+Lepidoptera), and a monophyletic Endopterygota (Diptera+Lepidoptera+Coleoptera), suggesting that the complete insect mitogenome sequence has a resolving power to the diversification events within Endopterygota.

A gene network downstream of transcription factor Math5 regulates retinal progenitor cell competence and ganglion cell fate,15882586,10.1016/j.ydbio.2005.01.028,"Math5, a mouse homolog of the Drosophila proneural bHLH transcription factor Atonal, is essential in the developing retina to establish retinal progenitor cell competence for a ganglion cell fate. Elucidating the mechanisms by which Math5 influences progenitor cell competence is crucial for understanding how specification of neuronal cell fate occurs in the retina and it requires knowledge of the downstream target genes that depend on Math5 for their expression. To date, only a handful of genes downstream of Math5 have been identified. To better define the gene network operating downstream of Math5, we used custom-designed microarrays to examine the changes in embryonic retinal gene expression caused by deletion of math5. We identified 270 Math5-dependent genes, including those that were expressed specifically either in progenitor cells or differentiated ganglion cells. The ganglion cell-specific genes included both Brn3b-dependent and Brn3b-independent genes, indicating that Math5 regulates distinct branches of the gene network responsible for retinal ganglion cell differentiation. In math5-null progenitor cells, there was an up-regulation of the proneural genes math3, neuroD, and ngn2, indicating that Math5 suppresses the production of other cell types in addition to promoting retinal ganglion cell formation. The promoter regions of many Math5-dependent genes contained binding sites for REST/NRSF, suggesting that release from general repression in retinal progenitor cells is required for ganglion cell-specific gene activation. The identification of multiple roles for Math5 provides new insights into the gene network that defines progenitor cell competence in the embryonic retina.",2005,"Phillip D Beremand, Xiuqian Mu, Hongxia Sun, Xueyao Fu, Terry L Thomas, William H Klein"

We observed that BMP4 and BMP7, bound to receptor complexes comprised of Wit and the type I receptor thickveins and saxophone to activate a BMP-like signaling pathway. Further we demonstrated that both myoglianin and its most closely related mammalian ligand, myostatin, interacted with a Wit and Baboon (Babo) type II-type I receptor complex to activate TGFbeta/activin-like signaling pathways. These results thereby demonstrate that Wit binds multiple ligands to activate both BMP and TGFbeta-like signaling pathways.

"Mis-specified cells die by an active gene-directed process, and inhibition of this death results in cell fate transformation in Drosophila",16280349,10.1242/dev.02150,"Incorrectly specified or mis-specified cells often undergo cell death or are transformed to adopt a different cell fate during development. The underlying cause for this distinction is largely unknown. In many developmental mutants in Drosophila, large numbers of mis-specified cells die synchronously, providing a convenient model for analysis of this phenomenon. The maternal mutant bicoid is particularly useful model with which to address this issue because its mutant phenotype is a combination of both transformation of tissue (acron to telson) and cell death in the presumptive head and thorax regions. We show that a subset of these mis-specified cells die through an active gene-directed process involving transcriptional upregulation of the cell death inducer hid. Upregulation of hid also occurs in oskar mutants and other segmentation mutants. In hid bicoid double mutants, mis-specified cells in the presumptive head and thorax survive and continue to develop, but they are transformed to adopt a different cell fate. We provide evidence that the terminal torso signaling pathway protects the mis-specified telson tissue in bicoid mutants from hid-induced cell death, whereas mis-specified cells in the head and thorax die, presumably because equivalent survival signals are lacking. These data support a model whereby mis-specification can be tolerated if a survival pathway is provided, resulting in cellular transformation.",2005,"Melinda Lackey, Peter L Lee, Clare Bolduc, David S Stein, Andreas Bergmann, Christian Werz, Tom V Lee"
The Plk3-Cdc25 circuit,15640846,10.1038/sj.onc.1208278,"Polo-like kinases (Plks) are key regulators of the cell cycle, especially in the G2 phase and mitosis. They are incorporated into signaling networks that regulate many aspects of the cell cycle, including but not limited to centrosome maturation and separation, mitotic entry, chromosome segregation, mitotic exit, and cytokinesis. The Plks have well conserved 30-amino-acid elements, designated polo boxes (PBs), located in their carboxyl-termini, which with their flanking regions constitute a functional Polo-box domain (PBD). Members of the Plk family exist in a variety of organisms including Polo in Drosophila melanogaster; Cdc5 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Plo1 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe; Plx1 in Xenopus laevis; and Plk1, Snk/Plk2, Fnk/Prk/Plk3, and Sak in mammals. Polo, Cdc5, and Plo1 are essential for viability. The Plks can be separated into two groups according to their functions. The first group (Polo, Cdc5, plo1, Plx1, and Plk1) primarily performs mitotic functions, whereas the second group (Plk2 and Plk3) appears to have additional functions during the G1, S, and G2 phases of the cell cycle.

Multiple Promoter Targeting Sequences exist in Abdominal-B to regulate long-range gene activation,16197941,10.1016/j.ydbio.2005.08.025,"In complex genomes, insulators set up chromatin domain boundaries and protect promoters from inappropriate activation by enhancers from neighboring genes. The Drosophila Abdominal-B locus uses insulator elements to organize its large regulatory region into several body segment-specific chromatin domains. This organization leads to a problem in enhancer-promoter communication, that is, how do distal enhancers activate the Abd-B promoter when there are several insulators in between? This issue is partially resolved by the Promoter Targeting Sequence, which can overcome the enhancer blocking effect of an insulator. In this study, we describe a new Promoter Targeting Sequence, PTS-6, from the Abd-B 3' regulatory region. PTS-6, comprised of approximately 200 bp, was found to bypass both homologous Abdominal-B insulators, such as Fab-7 and Fab-8, and a heterologous insulator, suHw. Most importantly, it also overcomes a combination of two insulators such as Fab-7/Fab-8. Thus, PTS-6 could, in principle, target remote enhancers that are separated from the Abd-B promoter by multiple insulators. In addition, PTS-6 selectively targets the distal enhancer to only one transgenic promoter, and it strongly facilitates Abd-B enhancers. These results suggest that promoter targeting is necessary for long-range enhancer-promoter communication in Abd-B, and PTS elements could be a common occurrence in large, complex genetic loci.",2005,"Qing Lin, Jumin Zhou, Qi Chen, Sheryl Smith, Lan Lin"

At the bnch larval neuromuscular junction, we observe similar inclusions and find defects in synaptic vesicle recycling at the level of endocytosis. In addition, loss of bnch slows endosome-to-lysosome trafficking in larval garland cells. In adult bnch flies, we observe age-dependent synaptic dysfunction and neuronal degeneration. Finally, we find that loss of bnch strongly enhances tau neurotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner.

Interaction of heterochromatin protein 2 with HP1 defines a novel HP1-binding domain,16201764,10.1021/bi051006+,"Heterochromatin Protein 2 (HP2) is a nonhistone chromosomal protein from Drosophila melanogaster localized principally in the pericentric heterochromatin, telomeres, and fourth chromosome, all regions associated with HP1. Mutations in HP2 can suppress position effect variegation, indicating a role in gene silencing and heterochromatin formation [Shaffer, C. D. et al. (2002) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.U.S.A. 99, 14332-14337]. In vitro coimmunoprecipitation experiments with various peptides from HP2 have identified a single HP1-binding domain. Conserved domains in HP2, including those within the HP1-binding region, have been identified by recovering and sequencing Su(var)2-HP2 from D. willistoni and D. virilis, as well as examining available sequence data from D. pseudoobscura. A PxVxL motif, shown to be an HP1-binding domain in many HP1-interacting proteins, is observed but is not well-conserved in location and sequence and does not mediate HP2 binding to HP1. The sole HP1-binding domain is composed of two conserved regions of 12 and 16 amino acids separated by 19 amino acids. Site-directed mutagenesis within the two conserved regions has shown that the 16 amino acid domain is critical for HP1 binding.

The Drosophila melanogaster T-box genes midline and H15 are conserved regulators of heart development,15680363,10.1016/j.ydbio.2004.11.026,"The Drosophila melanogaster genes midline and H15 encode predicted T-box transcription factors homologous to vertebrate Tbx20 genes. All identified vertebrate Tbx20 genes are expressed in the embryonic heart and we find that both midline and H15 are expressed in the cardioblasts of the dorsal vessel, the insect organ equivalent to the vertebrate heart. The midline mRNA is first detected in dorsal mesoderm at embryonic stage 12 in the two progenitors per hemisegment that will divide to give rise to all six cardioblasts. Expression of H15 mRNA in the dorsal mesoderm is detected first in four to six cells per hemisegment at stage 13. The expression of midline and H15 in the dorsal vessel is dependent on Wingless signaling and the transcription factors tinman and pannier. We find that the selection of two midline-expressing cells from a pool of competent progenitors is dependent on Notch signaling. Embryos deleted for both midline and H15 have defects in the alignment of the cardioblasts and associated pericardial cells. Embryos null for midline have weaker and less penetrant phenotypes while embryos deficient for H15 have morphologically normal hearts, suggesting that the two genes are partially redundant in heart development. Despite the dorsal vessel defects, embryos mutant for both midline and H15 have normal numbers of cardioblasts, suggesting that cardiac cell fate specification is not disrupted. However, ectopic expression of midline in the dorsal mesoderm can lead to dramatic increases in the expression of cardiac markers, suggesting that midline and H15 participate in cardiac fate specification and may normally act redundantly with other cardiogenic factors. Conservation of Tbx20 expression and function in cardiac development lends further support for a common ancestral origin of the insect dorsal vessel and the vertebrate heart.",2005,"Pia C Svendsen, Rick J Scavetta, Cindy M Miskolczi-McCallum, Kelly H Soanes, William J Brook"
Evolutionary change in parasitoid resistance under crowded conditions in Drosophila melanogaster,16050105,,"Patterns of investment of limiting resources in such processes as competing for food and defense against natural enemies are shaped by trade-offs and constraints. In Drosophila melanogaster artificial selection for increased resistance to parasitoids results in a correlated decrease in larval competitive ability. Here we ask whether selection for competitive ability leads to a correlated reduction in parasitoid resistance. Replicated lines of D. melanogaster were maintained under crowded or uncrowded conditions for eight generations. As expected, the crowded lines evolved higher competitive ability (when tested against a common strain of fly). But instead of parasitoid resistance decreasing, we found a significant increase, and that this was associated with elevated densities of haemocytes in second-instar larvae. To understand these results we measured a variety of life-history traits in the two sets of lines. We find evidence that directly and indirectly selected changes in competitive ability are due to different mechanisms. We also ask why crowded conditions should select for increased resistance to parasitism, and conclude that it is unlikely to be due to correlated selection for resistance to other natural enemies, but might be due to correlated selection for better wound responses.",2005,"Claire Scarborough, Sophie J Layen, Amy E Sanders, H Charles J Godfray, Alex R Kraaijeveld"

Comparative evolutionary analysis of VPS33 homologues: genetic and functional insights,15790593,10.1093/hmg/ddi137,"VPS33B protein is a homologue of the yeast class C vacuolar protein sorting protein Vps33p that is involved in the biogenesis and function of vacuoles. Vps33p homologues contain a Sec1 domain and belong to the family of Sec1/Munc18 (SM) proteins that regulate fusion of membrane-bound organelles and interact with other vps proteins and also SNARE proteins that execute membrane fusion in all cells. We demonstrated recently that mutations in VPS33B cause ARC syndrome (MIM 208085), a lethal multisystem disease. In contrast, mutations in other Vps33p homologues result in different phenotypes, e.g. a mutation in Drosophila melanogaster car gene causes the carnation eye colour mutant and inactivation of mouse Vps33a causes buff hypopigmentation phenotype. In mammals two Vps33p homologues (e.g. VPS33A and VPS33B in humans) have been identified. As comparative genome analysis can provide novel insights into gene evolution and function, we performed nucleotide and protein sequence comparisons of Vps33 homologues in different species to define their inter-relationships and evolution. In silico analysis (a) identified two homologues of yeast Vps33p in the worm, fly, zebrafish, rodent and human genomes, (b) suggested that Carnation is an orthologue of VPS33A rather than VPS33B and (c) identified conserved candidate functional domains within VPS33B. We have shown previously that wild-type VPS33B induced perinuclear clustering of late endosomes and lysosomes in human renal cells. Consistent with the predictions of comparative analysis: (a) VPS33B induced significantly more clustering than VPS33A in a renal cell line, (b) a putative fly VPS33B homologue but not Carnation protein also induced clustering and (c) the ability to induce clustering in renal cells was linked to two evolutionary conserved domains within VPS33B. One domain was present in VPS33B but not VPS33A homologues and the other was one of three regions predicted to form a t-SNARE binding site in VPS33B. In contrast, VPS33A induced significantly more clustering of melanosomes in melanoma cells than VPS33B.

Quantitative analysis of protein dynamics during asymmetric cell division,16243032,10.1016/j.cub.2005.08.067,"In dividing Drosophila sensory organ precursor (SOP) cells, the fate determinant Numb and its associated adaptor protein Pon localize asymmetrically and segregate into the anterior daughter cell, where Numb influences cell fate by repressing Notch signaling. Asymmetric localization of both proteins requires the protein kinase aPKC and its substrate Lethal (2) giant larvae (Lgl). Because both Numb and Pon localization require actin and myosin, lateral transport along the cell cortex has been proposed as a possible mechanism for their asymmetric distribution. Here, we use quantitative live analysis of GFP-Pon and Numb-GFP fluorescence and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) to characterize the dynamics of Numb and Pon localization during SOP division. We demonstrate that Numb and Pon rapidly exchange between a cytoplasmic pool and the cell cortex and that preferential recruitment from the cytoplasm is responsible for their asymmetric distribution during mitosis. Expression of a constitutively active form of aPKC impairs membrane recruitment of GFP-Pon. This defect can be rescued by coexpression of nonphosphorylatable Lgl, indicating that Lgl is the main target of aPKC. We propose that a high-affinity binding site is asymmetrically distributed by aPKC and Lgl and is responsible for asymmetric localization of cell-fate determinants during mitosis.",2005,"Daniela Berdnik, Bernd Mayer, Frederik Wirtz-Peitz, Gregory Emery, Juergen A Knoblich"

A novel P-element insertion in the Rab11 locus, Rab11mo, displayed characteristic retinal anomalies, which could be reverted by P-element excision and expression of Rab11+ transgenes. During larval development, Rab11 is widely synthesized in photoreceptor cells and localizes to the rhabdomeres and lamina neuropil in adult eyes. Photoreceptors and associated bristles failed to be formed in homozygous clones generated in Rab11EP(3)3017 eyes. Decreased levels of Rab11 protein and increased cell death in Rab11mo third-instar larval eye-antennal discs suggest that the retinal defects originate during larval development.

SRPKs phosphorylate serine-arginine rich splicing factors (SR proteins). Since proteins expressed from CG11489 cDNAs phosphorylate a peptide from a human SR protein in vitro, we name CG11489 the Drosophila Srpk79D gene. We have characterized Srpk79D transcripts and generated a null mutant. Mutation of the Srpk79D gene causes conspicuous accumulations of BRP in larval and adult nerves. At the ultrastructural level, these correspond to extensive axonal agglomerates of electron-dense ribbons surrounded by clear vesicles. Basic synaptic structure and function at larval neuromuscular junctions appears normal, whereas life expectancy and locomotor behavior of adult mutants are significantly impaired. All phenotypes of the mutant can be largely or completely rescued by panneural expression of SRPK79D isoforms. Isoform-specific antibodies recognize panneurally overexpressed GFP-tagged SRPK79D-PC isoform co-localized with BRP at presynaptic active zones while the tagged -PB isoform is found in spots within neuronal perikarya. SRPK79D concentrations in wild type apparently are too low to be revealed by these antisera. We propose that the Drosophila Srpk79D gene characterized here may be expressed at low levels throughout the nervous system to prevent the assembly of BRP containing agglomerates in axons and maintain intact brain function. The discovery of an SR protein kinase required for normal BRP distribution calls for the identification of its substrate and the detailed analysis of SRPK function for the maintenance of nervous system integrity.",2009,"Vanessa Nieratschker, Sigrid Buchner, Daniel Bucher, Sonja Dippacher, Esther Asan, Alice Schubert, Georg Krohne, Mandy Jauch, Erich Buchner, Nicole Bock"
"Neprilysin 4, a novel endopeptidase from Drosophila melanogaster, displays distinct substrate specificities and exceptional solubility states",19880729,10.1242/jeb.034272,"Proteins belonging to the family of neprilysins are typically membrane bound M13 endopeptidases responsible for the inactivation and/or activation of peptide signaling events on cell surfaces. Mammalian neprilysins are known to be involved in the metabolism of various regulatory peptides especially in the nervous, immune, cardiovascular and inflammatory systems. Although there is still much to learn about their participation in various diseases, they are potential therapeutic targets. Here we report on the identification and first characterization of neprilysin 4 (NEP4) from Drosophila melanogaster. Reporter lines as well as in situ hybridization combined with immunolocalization demonstrated NEP4 expression during embryogenesis in pericardial cells, muscle founder cells, glia cells and male gonads. Western blot analysis confirmed the prediction of one membrane bound and one soluble isoform, a finding quite unusual among neprilysins with presumably strong physiological relevance. At least one NEP4 isoform was found in every developmental stage indicating protein activities required throughout the whole life cycle of Drosophila. Heterologously expressed NEP4 exhibited substrate preferences comparable to human neprilysin 2 with distinct cleavage of substance P and angiotensin I.",2009,"Heiko Meyer, Monika Zmojdzian, Achim Paululat, Krzysztof Jagla, Mareike Panz"
Comparative analysis of five immunity-related genes reveals different levels of adaptive evolution in the virilis and melanogaster groups of Drosophila,19223926,10.1038/hdy.2009.11,"Five immunity-related genes previously reported to be evolving under positive selection in Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans have been analysed across the Drosophila genus using two types of approaches, random-site and branch-site likelihood models as well as the proportion of synonymous and non-synonymous variation within and between species. Different selective pressures have been detected in the sample of genes, one showing evidence for adaptive evolution across the phylogeny of Drosophila and two showing lineage-specific positive selection. Furthermore, amino-acid sites identified as being under positive selection in the melanogaster and the virilis groups are different, suggesting that the evolution of the proteins in these two divergent groups may have been shaped by different pathogens.",2009,"R Morales-Hojas, J Vieira, M Reis, C P Vieira"
Gene regulatory networks underlying the compartmentalization of the Ciona central nervous system,19088089,10.1242/dev.026419,"The tripartite organization of the central nervous system (CNS) may be an ancient character of the bilaterians. However, the elaboration of the more complex vertebrate brain depends on the midbrain-hindbrain boundary (MHB) organizer, which is absent in invertebrates such as Drosophila. The Fgf8 signaling molecule expressed in the MHB organizer plays a key role in delineating separate mesencephalon and metencephalon compartments in the vertebrate CNS. Here, we present evidence that an Fgf8 ortholog establishes sequential patterns of regulatory gene expression in the developing posterior sensory vesicle, and the interleaved ;neck' region located between the sensory vesicle and visceral ganglion of the simple chordate Ciona intestinalis. The detailed characterization of gene networks in the developing CNS led to new insights into the mechanisms by which Fgf8/17/18 patterns the chordate brain. The precise positioning of this Fgf signaling activity depends on an unusual AND/OR network motif that regulates Snail, which encodes a threshold repressor of Fgf8 expression. Nodal is sufficient to activate low levels of the Snail repressor within the neural plate, while the combination of Nodal and Neurogenin produces high levels of Snail in neighboring domains of the CNS. The loss of Fgf8 patterning activity results in the transformation of hindbrain structures into an expanded mesencephalon in both ascidians and vertebrates, suggesting that the primitive MHB-like activity predates the vertebrate CNS.",2009,"Kaoru S Imai, Alberto Stolfi, Michael Levine, Yutaka Satou"
[Protein transduction domain peptide mediates delivery to the brain via the blood-brain barrier in Drosophila],19351032,,"Protein transduction domain (PTD)-peptides greatly facilitate the delivery of high molecular weight macromolecules across the blood-brain barrier (BBB).

However, the drug discovery process is limited by the generation of a simple and reliable BBB model that is amenable to testing of large number of samples and simultaneously, reproduces the physiological and functional characteristics of the human BBB. To address these challenges, we have studied whether the PTD-peptide penetratin, derived from a Drosophila Antennapedia homeodomain protein, is capable of crossing the BBB in Drosophila while carrying a cargo into the fly brain. An initial in vivo experiment in Drosophila showed that abdominal injection of biotin-tagged penetratin permeated the BBB.

The role of Parafibromin/Hyrax as a nuclear Gli/Ci-interacting protein in Hedgehog target gene control,19368795,10.1016/j.mod.2009.02.002,"The Hedgehog (Hh) pathway, an evolutionarily conserved key regulator of embryonic patterning and tissue homeostasis, controls its target genes by managing the processing and activities of the Gli/Ci transcription factors. Little is known about the nuclear co-factors the Gli/Ci proteins recruit, and how they mechanistically control Hh target genes. Here, we provide evidence for the involvement of Parafibromin/Hyx as a positive component in Hh signaling. We found that hyx RNAi impaired Hh pathway activity in Drosophila cell culture. Consistent with an evolutionarily conserved function in Hh signaling, RNAi-mediated knockdown of Parafibromin in mammalian cell culture experiments diminished the transcriptional activity of Gli1 and Gli2. In vivo, in Drosophila, genetic impairment of hyx decreased the expression of the high-threshold Hh target gene knot/collier. Conversely, hyx overexpression ameliorated the inhibitory activity of Ptc and Ci(75) misexpression during Drosophila wing development. We subsequently found that Parafibromin can form a complex with all three Glis, and provide evidence that Parafibromin/Hyx directly binds Region 1, the Su(fu) interaction domain, in the N-terminus of all Glis and Ci. Taken together, our results suggest a target gene-selective involvement of the PAF1 complex in Hh signaling via the Parafibromin/Hyx-mediated recruitment to Gli/Ci.",2009,"Christian Mosimann, Konrad Basler, George Hausmann"

Uptake of the necrotic serpin in Drosophila melanogaster via the lipophorin receptor-1,19557185,10.1371/journal.pgen.1000532,"The humoral response to fungal and Gram-positive infections is regulated by the serpin-family inhibitor, Necrotic. Following immune-challenge, a proteolytic cascade is activated which signals through the Toll receptor. Toll activation results in a range of antibiotic peptides being synthesised in the fat-body and exported to the haemolymph. As with mammalian serpins, Necrotic turnover in Drosophila is rapid. This serpin is synthesised in the fat-body, but its site of degradation has been unclear. By ""freezing"" endocytosis with a temperature sensitive Dynamin mutation, we demonstrate that Necrotic is removed from the haemolymph in two groups of giant cells: the garland and pericardial athrocytes. Necrotic uptake responds rapidly to infection, being visibly increased after 30 mins and peaking at 6-8 hours. Co-localisation of anti-Nec with anti-AP50, Rab5, and Rab7 antibodies establishes that the serpin is processed through multi-vesicular bodies and delivered to the lysosome, where it co-localises with the ubiquitin-binding protein, HRS. Nec does not co-localise with Rab11, indicating that the serpin is not re-exported from athrocytes. Instead, mutations which block late endosome/lysosome fusion (dor, hk, and car) cause accumulation of Necrotic-positive endosomes, even in the absence of infection. Knockdown of the 6 Drosophila orthologues of the mammalian LDL receptor family with dsRNA identifies LpR1 as an enhancer of the immune response. Uptake of Necrotic from the haemolymph is blocked by a chromosomal deletion of LpR1. In conclusion, we identify the cells and the receptor molecule responsible for the uptake and degradation of the Necrotic serpin in Drosophila melanogaster. The scavenging of serpin/proteinase complexes may be a critical step in the regulation of proteolytic cascades.",2009,"David Gubb, Sandra Fausia Soukup, Joaquim Culi"

The role of the epicardium in myocardial morphogenesis and establishment of normal heart function is still largely unknown. Here, we use Drosophila to investigate non-autonomous influences of epicardial-like tissue surrounding the heart tube on the structural and functional integrity of the myocardium. It has previously been shown that during Drosophila heart formation, mesodermal expression of the homeobox transcription factor even-skipped (eve) is required for specification of a subset of non-myocardial progenitors in the precardiac mesoderm. These progenitors may share some similarities with the vertebrate epicardium. To investigate a non-autonomous epicardial-like influence on myocardial physiology, we studied the consequences of reduced mesodermal Eve expression and epi/pericardial cell numbers on the maturation of the myocardial heart tube, its contractility, and acquisition of a normal heart rhythm in the Drosophila model. Targeting the eve repressor ladybird early (lbe) with the minimal eve mesodermal enhancer efficiently eliminates the mesodermal Eve lineages. These flies exhibit defects in heart structure, including a reduction in systolic and diastolic diameter (akin to 'restrictive cardiomyopathy'). They also exhibit an elevated incidence of arrhythmias and intermittent asystoles, as well as compromised performance under stress. These abnormalities are restored by eve reexpression or by lbe-RNAi co-overexpression. The data suggest that adult heart function in Drosophila is likely to be modulated non-autonomously, possibly by paracrine influences from neighboring cells, such as the epi/pericardium. Thus, Drosophila may serve as a model for finding genetic effectors of epicardial-myocardial interactions relevant to higher organisms.",2009,"Takeshi Akasaka, Pilar Ruiz-Lozano, Tina Buechling, Karen Ocorr, Rolf Bodmer, Georg Vogler"

Hemojuvelin: the hepcidin story continues,19287179,10.1159/000208988,"Hemojuvelin (HJV) is a membrane protein that is responsible for the iron overload condition known as juvenile hemochromatosis. HJV, highly expressed in the liver, skeletal muscle and heart, seems to play a role in iron absorption and release from cells and has anti-inflammatory properties. HJV is a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) co-receptor and signals via the SMAD (human homolog of Drosophila mad--mother against decapentaplegic) pathway to regulate hepcidin expression. HJV acts as a BMP co-receptor. Moreover, HJV plays an essential role in the regulation of hepcidin expression, specifically in the iron-sensing pathway, although through unknown mechanisms. Dietary iron sensing and inflammatory pathways converge in the regulation of the key regulator hepcidin, but how these two pathways intersect remains unclear. Inflammation, through downregulation of hepatic HJV, might induce temporary elimination of iron sensing. Despite enormous scientific achievements in explaining the pathogenetic mechanisms of iron metabolism, many questions still remain unanswered: What is the functional role of HJV in iron metabolism? How it is related to hepcidin expression in different settings? How do iron-sensing and inflammatory pathways cooperate in hepcidin gene expression?",2009,Jolanta Malyszko

The results showed that there was no significant difference in the rates of egg-laying.

When trapped, these particles drive the next stage by converting mobile particles of a different type from a passive to active form.

TRAPPII is required for cleavage furrow ingression and localization of Rab11 in dividing male meiotic cells of Drosophila,19934220,10.1242/jcs.054536,"Although membrane addition is crucial for cytokinesis in many animal cell types, the specific mechanisms supporting cleavage furrow ingression are not yet understood.

In non-dividing cells, Brunelleschi protein fused to GFP is dispersed throughout the cytoplasm and enriched at Golgi organelles, similarly to another Drosophila TRAPPII subunit, dBet3. Localization of the membrane-trafficking GTPase Rab11 to the cleavage furrow requires wild-type function of bru, and genetic interactions between bru and Rab11 increase the failure of meiotic cytokinesis and cause synthetic lethality. bru also genetically interacts with four wheel drive (fwd), which encodes a PI4Kbeta, such that double mutants exhibit enhanced failure of male meiotic cytokinesis.

Quantitative analysis of synaptic boutons in Drosophila primary neuronal cultures,19460362,10.1016/j.brainres.2009.05.026,"Little information is currently available for structural and quantitative aspects of Drosophila central synapses due to difficulties in accessing those synapses in the tiny fly brain. Here, we developed a new approach to quantitatively analyze central synapses using Drosophila primary neuronal cultures. Two different markers were used to identify synaptic boutons: GFP marking with a synaptotagmin (Syt)::eGFP transgene and anti-Syt antibody. These markers clearly recognized puncta-like synaptic boutons and both signals were well overlapped. In addition, these puncta signals were completely absent in neuronal cultures derived from a Syt null mutant Syt(AD4), firmly demonstrating that anti-Syt(+) puncta are presynaptic terminals. Since anti-Syt signals were stronger and extensive, it was chosen to quantify synaptic boutons in the neuronal culture. Using an image analysis software Image J, synaptic boutons were quantified on the basis of the size and intensity of anti-Syt(+) signals. The number of synaptic boutons in wild type neurons increased by 27% between 3 and 9 days in culture. This increase was much greater (142%) in neuronal cultures derived from a FasII(e86) mutant known to show alterations in synapse growth and stabilization. A parallel increase in neurite length was also observed in both wild type and FasII(e86) neurons. Interestingly, the number of GABAergic synaptic boutons did not increase during this time, indicating distinctive mechanisms underlying development and maintenance of specific types of boutons.

Next generation transcriptomes for next generation genomes using est2assembly,20034392,10.1186/1471-2105-10-447,"Background: The decreasing costs of capillary-based Sanger sequencing and next generation technologies, such as 454 pyrosequencing, have prompted an explosion of transcriptome projects in non-model species, where even shallow sequencing of transcriptomes can now be used to examine a range of research questions. This rapid growth in data has outstripped the ability of researchers working on non-model species to analyze and mine transcriptome data efficiently. Results: Here we present a semi-automated platform 'est2assembly' that processes raw sequence data from Sanger or 454 sequencing into a hybrid de-novo assembly, annotates it and produces GMOD compatible output, including a SeqFeature database suitable for GBrowse. Users are able to parameterize assembler variables, judge assembly quality and determine the optimal assembly for their specific needs. We used est2assembly to process Drosophila and Bicyclus public Sanger EST data and then compared them to published 454 data as well as eight new insect transcriptome collections. Conclusions: Analysis of such a wide variety of data allows us to understand how these new technologies can assist EST project design. We determine that assembler parameterization is as essential as standardized methods to judge the output of ESTs projects.

In mice, long-arm deletions have an impact on spermiogenesis, with the most extensive deletions resulting in severe sperm head malformations and infertility. Intriguingly, smaller deletions are compatible with fertility but result in a distorted sex ratio in favor of females, and recently it was found that Y long-arm deletions are also associated with a marked upregulation of several X-encoded and Y-encoded spermatid-expressed genes. The mouse Y long arm encodes a number of distinct transcripts, each of which derives from multiple gene copies. Of these multicopy genes, the recently described Sly has been favored as the gene underlying the spermiogenic defects associated with Y long-arm deletions. To assess the candidacy of Sly, the expression of this gene was examined in the testis at the transcript and protein levels. Sly is transcribed after the first meiotic division in secondary spermatocytes and round spermatids and encodes two transcript variants, Sly_v1 and Sly_v2 (proteins referred to as SLY1 and SLY2). We raised an antibody against SLY1 which detected the protein in round and early elongating spermatids, where it is predominantly cytoplasmic. Yeast two-hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that SLY1 interacts with the acrosomal protein DKKL1, the histone acetyltransferase KAT5 (also known as TIP60), and the microtubule-associated protein APPBP2.

Circadian clock genes and sleep homeostasis,19473235,10.1111/j.1460-9568.2009.06723.x,"Circadian and sleep-homeostatic processes both contribute to sleep timing and sleep structure. Elimination of circadian rhythms through lesions of the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), the master circadian pacemaker, leads to fragmentation of wakefulness and sleep but does not eliminate the homeostatic response to sleep loss as indexed by the increase in EEG delta power. In humans, EEG delta power declines during sleep episodes nearly independently of circadian phase. Such observations have contributed to the prevailing notion that circadian and homeostatic processes are separate but recent data imply that this segregation may not extend to the molecular level. Here we summarize the criteria and evidence for a role for clock genes in sleep homeostasis. Studies in mice with targeted disruption for core circadian clock genes have revealed alterations in circadian rhythmicity as well as changes in sleep duration, sleep structure and EEG delta power. Clock-gene expression in brain areas outside the SCN, in particular the cerebral cortex, depends to a large extent on prior sleep-wake history. Evidence for effects of clock genes on sleep homeostasis has also been obtained in Drosophila and humans, pointing to a phylogenetically preserved pathway. These findings suggest that, while within the SCN clock genes are utilized to set internal time-of-day, in the forebrain the same feedback circuitry may be utilized to track time spent awake and asleep. The mechanisms by which clock-gene expression is coupled to the sleep-wake distribution could be through cellular energy charge whereby clock genes act as energy sensors. The data underscore the interrelationships between energy metabolism, circadian rhythmicity, and sleep regulation.",2009,"P Franken, D-J Dijk"

Here, we examine nucleotide variation in six protein-coding loci for Daphnia pulex and its congeners with particular emphasis on D. pulicaria, the closest extant relative of D. pulex. Levels of synonymous intraspecific variation, pi(s), averaged 0.0136 for species in the Daphnia genus, and are slightly lower than most prior estimates in invertebrates. Tests of neutrality indicated that segregating variation conforms to neutral model expectations for the loci that we examined in most species, while K(a)/K(s) ratios revealed strong purifying selection. Using a full maximum-likelihood coalescent-based method, the ratio of the recombination rate to the mutation rate (c/u), averaged 0.5255 for species of the Daphnia genus.

To explore the use of proteasome mutations for a conditional lethal system in insect pests, we identified and isolated the beta2 subunit gene of the 20S proteasome from the Caribbean fruit fly, Anastrepha suspensa. The caribfly ortholog AsProsbeta2 was isolated from pupal cDNA by 5' and 3' RACE. The AsProsbeta2 protein has high amino acid sequence similarity to predicted insect Prosbeta2 subunits and homologs from yeast and mammals, and it contains the well conserved amino acids that confer catalytic activity and substrate specificity. AsProsbeta2 is a single copy gene and its RNA accumulates throughout all developmental stages of the caribfly. For functional studies a point mutation, analogous to the Prosbeta2(1) mutation in D. melanogaster, was introduced into AsProsbeta2 to create an aberrant protein with a Gly170Arg substitution. Consistent with the DTS-7 mutation, transgenic insects carrying the mutant allele undergo normal metamorphosis at the permissive temperature (25 degrees C) but at the non-permissive temperature (29 degrees C) they exhibit effective pupal lethality. This is the first report of a functional characterization of a Prosbeta2 cognate based on the creation of a dominant temperature-sensitive mutation. This type of temperature-dependent lethality could be used for biological control, where transgenic insects are reared to adulthood at 25 degrees C or lower and then released into the field where ambient temperatures averaging 29 degrees C or greater cause lethality in their progeny.",2009,"A M Handler, G J Zimowska, X Nirmala"
CaMKII uses GTP as a phosphate donor for both substrate and autophosphorylation,19857459,10.1016/j.bbrc.2009.10.107,"The vast majority of serine/threonine protein kinases have a strong preference for ATP over GTP as a phosphate donor. CK2 (Casein kinase 2) is an exception to this rule and in this study we investigate whether calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) has the same extended nucleotide range. Using the Drosophila enzyme, we have shown that CaMKII uses Mg(2+)GTP with a higher K(m) and V(max) compared to Mg(2+)ATP. Substitution of Mn(2+) for Mg(2+) resulted in a much lower K(m) for GTP, while nearly abolishing the ability of CaMKII to use ATP. These similar results were obtained with rat alphaCaMKII, showing the ability to use GTP to be a general property of CaMKII. The V(max) difference between Mg(2+)ATP and Mg(2+)GTP was found to be due to the fact that ADP is a potent inhibitor of phosphorylation, while GDP has modest effects. There were no differences found between sites autophosphorylated by ATP and GTP, either by partial proteolysis or mass spectrometry. Phosphorylation of fly head extract revealed that similar proteins are substrates for CaMKII whether using Mg(2+)ATP or Mg(2+)GTP. This new information confirms that CaMKII can use both ATP and GTP, and opens new avenues for the study of regulation of this kinase.",2009,"Leslie C Griffith, Justin Dore, S Lynn Bostrom"

We detected PTCH1 mutations in 22 patients in 19 families, including insertion/deletion mutations in 13 patients in 11 families (86%), chromosomal deletions in 4 patients in 3 families (16%), nonsense mutations in 2 patients in 2 families (11%), splicing mutations in 3 patients in 3 families (16%), and a missense mutation in 1 patient (5.3%). The sixteen mutations were distributed in extracellular loops (10 mutations: 63%), intracellular loops (four mutations: 25%), and transmembrane portions (two mutations: 13%). Our detection rate of PTCH1 mutations, i.e., 86%, was much higher than those previously reported from other countries. The differences may be derived either from ethnicity or the detection methods.",2009,"Yoichi Kohno, Hideki Uchikawa, Katsunori Fujii, Mamiko Endo, Ryo Tanabe, Katsuo Sugita, Hidee Arai, Toshiyuki Miyashita"
Lifespan extension by dietary restriction is not linked to protection against somatic DNA damage in Drosophila melanogaster,19627272,10.1111/j.1474-9726.2009.00480.x,"Dietary restriction (DR) has been shown to robustly extend lifespan in multiple species tested so far. The pro-longevity effect of DR is often ascribed to an increase in cellular defense against somatic damage, most notably damage by reactive oxygen species (ROS), considered a major cause of aging. Especially irreversible damage to DNA, the carrier of genetic information, is considered a critical causal factor in aging. Using a recently developed transgenic Drosophila melanogaster model system harboring a lacZ-plasmid construct that can be recovered in E. coli, spontaneous DNA mutation frequency in flies under DR and ad libitum conditions are measured. Three different DR conditions, imposed by manipulating levels of different types of yeast sources, were tested in females and males of two lacZ reporter gene lines. Feeding with the ROS producer paraquat at 1 mM resulted in a rapid accumulation of somatic mutations, indicating that the frequency of mutations at the lacZ locus is a reliable marker for increased oxidative stress. However, none of the DR conditions altered the accumulation of spontaneous mutations with age. These results suggest that the beneficial effects of DR are unlikely to be linked to protection against oxidative somatic DNA damage.",2009,"Ana Maria Garcia, Dylan Sorensen, Jan Vijg, Rita A Busuttil, Pankaj Kapahi, Ursula Edman, Martha Lundell"
Plakoglobin induces desmosome formation and epidermoid phenotype in N-cadherin-expressing squamous carcinoma cells deficient in plakoglobin and E-cadherin,9605974,10.1002/(SICI)1097-0169(1998)40:1<87::AID-CM8>3.0.CO;2-C,"Pg is a homologue of beta-catenin and Armadillo, the product of the Drosophila segment polarity gene and has been shown to have both adhesive and signaling functions. It interacts with both classic and desmosomal cadherins. Pg interaction with the desmosomal cadherins is essential for desmosome assembly. Its precise role in the classic cadherin complexes is unclear, although Pg-E-cadherin interaction appears to be necessary for the formation of desmosomes. In addition to cadherins in adhesion complexes, Pg interacts with a number of proteins involved in regulation of cell differentiation and proliferation such as Lef-1/Tcf-1 transcription factors and the tumor suppressor protein APC. In this study, we have introduced Pg cDNA into SCC9 cells, a Pg- and E-cadherin-deficient squamous cell carcinoma line, which also lacks desmosomes. These cells have both alpha-catenin and beta-catenin, display unusual expression of N-cadherin, and have the typical fibroblastic phenotype of transformed cells. Pg-expressing SCC9 cells (SCC9P) formed desmosomes. Desmosome formation coincided with the appearance of an epidermoid phenotype, with increased adhesiveness and a contact-dependent decrease in growth. Biochemical characterization of SCC9P cells showed an increase in the expression and stability of N-cadherin and a decrease in level and stability of beta-catenin, without any apparent effects on alpha-catenin. These results show that, in the absence of E-cadherin, Pg can efficiently use N-cadherin to induce desmosome formation and epidermoid phenotype. They also suggest a role for Pg as one of the regulators of the intracellular beta-catenin levels and underscore the pivotal role of this protein in regulating cell adhesion and differentiation.",1998,"H R Parker, H Sheinin, Z Li, M Pasdar, G Lauzon"
NTP Toxicology and Carcinogenesis Studies of Tetrahydrofuran (CAS No. 109-99-9) in F344/N Rats and B6C3F1 Mice (Inhalation Studies),12571688,,"Tetrahydrofuran is used as a reaction medium for Grignard and metal hydride reactions; in the synthesis of butyrolactone, succinic acid, and 1,4-butanediol diacelate; in the fabrication of articles for packaging, transporting, and storing of foods; as a solvent for dyes and lacquers; and as a chemical intermediate in polymerization solvent for fat oils, unvulcanized rubber, resins, and plastics. Tetrahydrofuran is also an indirect food additive when it is in contact with the surface of articles intended for use in food processing. Tetrahydrofuran was nominated for study because of the potential for occupational exposure in humans. Male and female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice were exposed to tetrahydrofuran (approximately 99% pure) by inhalation for 13 weeks or 2 years. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium, cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, Drosophila melanogaster, mouse bone marrow cells, and mouse peripheral blood cells erythrocites. 14-WEEK STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 10 male and 10 female rats were exposed to 0 (chamber control), 66, 200, 600, 1,800, or 5,000 ppm tetrahydrofuran by inhalation, 6 hours per day, 5 days per week, for 14 weeks. All rats survived until the end of the study. Final mean body weights and mean body weight gains of exposed groups of male and female rats were similar to those of the chamber controls. Immediately after exposure, male and female rats in the 5,000 ppm groups exhibited ataxia. Hematologic and serum chemistry changes were minimal, with most values falling within physiologic ranges. Absolute and relative thymus and spleen weights of male and female rats exposed to 5,000 ppm were significantly less than those of the chamber controls. Absolute and relative liver weights of female rats exposed to 5,000 ppm were significantly greater than those of the chamber controls. Increased incidences of minimal to mild hyperplasia of the forestomach were observed in male and female rats exposed to 5,000 ppm. Minimal suppurative inflammation was associated with forestomach hyperplasia in two male rats and four female rats exposed to 5,000 ppm. 14-WEEK STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 10 male and 10 female B6C3F1 mice were exposed to 0, 66, 200, 600, 1,800, or 5,000 ppm tetrahydrofuran by inhalation, 6 hours per day, 5 days per week, for 14 weeks. Two male mice exposed to 5,000 ppm died during weeks 2 and 8 of the study; one male mouse from the 5,000 ppm group was killed in a moribund state during week 4. All female mice survived until the end of the study. The final mean body weights and mean body weight gains of all exposed groups of male mice were similar to those of the chamber controls. The final mean body weight and mean body weight gain of the 5,000 ppm female mice were significantly greater than those of the chamber controls. Male and female mice exposed to 1,800 or 5,000 ppm were observed in a state of narcosis (described by stupor) during exposure periods. Mice exposed to 1,800 ppm were fully awake and alert immediately after exposure; however, mice exposed to 5,000 ppm required up to 2 hours for recovery. Absolute and relative liver weights of male mice exposed to 600 ppm or greater and of female mice exposed to 1800 or 5,000 ppm were significantly greater than those of the chamber controls. Absolute and relative thymus weights of male mice exposed to 600, 1,800, or 5,000 ppm were significantly less than those of the chamber controls. The incidences of minimal to mild centrilobular cytomegaly of the liver in male and female mice exposed to 5,000 ppm were significantly greater than those in the chamber controls. The adrenal glands of all female mice exposed to 5,000 ppm had mild degeneration of the X-zone of the innermost cortex. Uterine atrophy was observed in all female mice exposed to 5,000 ppm. 2-YEAR STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 50 male and 50 female rats were exposed to 0, 200, 600, or 1,800 ppm tetrahydrofuran by inhalation, 6 hours per day, 5 days per week, for 105 weeks. Survival, Body Weights, and Clinical Findings Survival and mean body weights of male and femand female rats exposed to tetrahydrofuran were similar to those of the chamber controls. Pathology Findings: The incidences of renal tubule epithelial adenoma or carcinoma (combined) in exposed males occurred with a positive trend, and the incidences in 600 and 1,800 ppm males exceeded the historical range for chamber controls in 2-year NTP inhalation studies. 2-YEAR STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 50 male and 50 female mice were exposed to 0, 200, 600, or 1,800 ppm tetrahydrofuran by inhalation, 6 hours per day, 5 days per week, for 105 weeks. Survival, Body Weights, and Clinical Findings After week 36, the survival of male mice exposed to 1,800 ppm was significantly less than that of the chamber controls. Mean body weights of male and female mice exposed to tetrahydrofuran were similar to those of the chamber controls throughout the study. Male mice exposed to 1,800 ppm were observed to be in a state of narcosis during and up to 1 hour after the exposure periods. Pathology Findings: The incidences andmultiplicity of hepatocellular neoplasms were significantly greater in female mice exposed to 1,800 ppm than in the chamber controls. The incidence of nephropathy in 200 ppm male mice was significantly greater than that in the chamber control group. Male mice exposed to 1,800 ppm had significantly greater incidences of nonneoplastic lesions of the urogenital tract than did the chamber controls. The incidences of inflammation of the penis and urethra and necrosis of the urethra in 1,800 ppm males were slightly greater than those in the chamber controls; these may have been secondary effects of ascending urinary tract infection. GENETIC TOXICOLOGY: Tetrahydrofuran showed little evidence of mutagenic activity in a variety of in vitro and in vivo assays. It was not mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium, and it did not induce sister chromatid exchanges or chromosomal aberrations in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells. These in vitro tests were conducted with and without exogenous metabolic activation from induced liver S9 enzymes. No increase in sex-linked recessive lethal mutations was detected in germ cells of male D. melanogaster exposed to tetrahydrofuran by feeding or injection. Results of in vivo assays for induction of chromosomal aberrations and sister chromatid exchanges in mouse bone marrow cells were negative. A micronucleus test in male and female mice exposed to tetrahydrofuran for 14 weeks showed no significant increases in the frequency of micronucleated erythrocytes in peripheral blood of female mice, but in male mice, analysis of micronucleated normochromatic erythrocyte levels revealed a small increase above baseline that was concluded to be equivocal. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of these 2-year inhalation studies, there was some evidence of carcinogenic activity of tetrahydrofuran in male F344/N rats based on increased incidences of renal tubule adenoma or carcinoma (combined). There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of tetrahydrofuran in female F344/N rats exposed to 200, 600, or 1,800 ppm or male B6C3F1 mice exposed to 200, 600, or 1,800 ppm. There was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of tetrahydrofuran in female B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of hepatocellular neoplasms.

"Mutation pressure, natural selection, and the evolution of base composition in Drosophila",9720271,,"Genome sequencing in a number of taxa has revealed variation in nucleotide composition both among regions of the genome and among functional classes of sites in DNA. Mutational biases, biased gene conversion, and natural selection have been proposed as causes of this variation. Here, we review patterns of base composition in Drosophila DNA. Nucleotide composition in Drosophila melanogaster varys regionally, and base composition is correlated between introns and exons. Drosophila species also show striking patterns of non-random codon usage. Patterns of synonymous codon usage and the biochemistry of translation suggest that natural selection may act at 'silent' sites. A relationship between recombination rates and codon usage and comparisons of the evolutionary dynamics of silent mutations within and between species support natural selection discriminating among synonymous codons. The causes of regional base composition variation are less clear. Progress in functional studies of non-coding DNA, further investigations of genome patterns, and statistical tests based on evolutionary theory will lead to a greater understanding of the contributions of mutational processes and natural selection in patterning genome-wide nucleotide composition.",1998,"A Eyre-Walker, R M Kliman, H Akashi"

Here, we analyze the molecular basis of positive (Y630) and negative (Y918) phosphotyrosine (pY) signaling sites on Torso. We find that the Drosophila homolog of RasGAP associates with pY918 and is a negative effector of Torso signaling. Further, we show that the tyrosine phosphatase Corkscrew (CSW), which associates with pY630, specifically dephosphorylates the negative pY918 Torso signaling site, thus identifying Torso to be a substrate of CSW in the terminal pathway. CSW also serves as an adaptor protein for DRK binding, physically linking Torso to Ras activation. The opposing actions of CSW and RasGAP modulate the strength of the Torso signal, contributing to the establishment of precise boundaries for terminal structure development.",1998,"D A Hughes, P Feldmann, D K Morrison, V Cleghon, C Ghiglione, N Perrimon, T D Copeland"

The possible functional role of NCS-1 in exocytosis of dense-core granules was tested using transient transfection in PC12 cells and assay of co-transfected growth hormone (GH) release.

Sampling the genomic pool of protein tyrosine kinase genes using the polymerase chain reaction with genomic DNA,9731193,10.1006/bbrc.1998.9003,"The polymerase chain reaction (PCR), with cDNA as template, has been widely used to identify members of protein families from many species. A major limitation of using cDNA in PCR is that detection of a family member is dependent on temporal and spatial patterns of gene expression. To circumvent this restriction, and in order to develop a technique that is broadly applicable we have tested the use of genomic DNA as PCR template to identify members of protein families in an expression-independent manner. This test involved amplification of DNA encoding protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) genes from the genomes of three animal species that are well known development models; namely, the mouse Mus musculus, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, and the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans. Ten PTK genes were identified from the mouse, 13 from the fruit fly, and 13 from the nematode worm. Among these kinases were 13 members of the PTK family that had not been reported previously. Selected PTKs from this screen were shown to be expressed during development, demonstrating that the amplified fragments did not arise from pseudogenes. This approach will be useful for the identification of many novel members of gene families in organisms of agricultural, medical, developmental and evolutionary significance and for analysis of gene families from any species, or biological sample whose habitat precludes the isolation of mRNA. Furthermore, as a tool to hasten the discovery of members of gene families that are of particular interest, this method offers an opportunity to sample the genome for new members irrespective of their expression pattern.",1998,"A C Oates, A F Wilks, P Wollberg, M G Achen"
Notch4 and Wnt-1 proteins function to regulate branching morphogenesis of mammary epithelial cells in an opposing fashion,9576833,10.1006/dbio.1998.8863,"Elongation and branching of epithelial ducts is a crucial event during the development of the mammary gland. Branching morphogenesis of the mouse mammary epithelial TAC-2 cell line was used as an assay to examine the role of Wnt, HGF, TGF-beta, and the Notch receptors in branching morphogenesis. Wnt-1 was found to induce the elongation and branching of epithelial tubules, like HGF and TGF-beta 2, and to strongly cooperate with either HGF or TGF-beta 2 in this activity. Wnt-1 displayed morphogenetic activity in TAC-2 cells as it induced branching even under conditions that normally promote cyst formation. The Notch4(int-3) mammary oncoprotein, an activated form of the Notch4 receptor, inhibited the branching morphogenesis normally induced by HGF and TGF-beta 2. The minimal domain within the Notch4(int-3) protein required to inhibit morphogenesis consists of the CBF-1 interaction domain and the cdc10 repeat domain. Coexpression of Wnt-1 and Notch4(int-3) demonstrates that Wnt-1 can overcome the Notch-mediated inhibition of branching morphogenesis. These data suggest that Wnt and Notch signaling may play opposite roles in mammary gland development, a finding consistent with the convergence of the wingless and Notch signaling pathways found in Drosophila.",1998,"J Kitajewski, R Montesano, J V Soriano, H Uyttendaele"
Electrophysiological development of central neurons in the Drosophila embryo,9614242,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.18-12-04673.1998,"In this study, we describe the development of electrical properties of Drosophila embryonic central neurons in vivo. Using whole-cell voltage clamp, we describe the onset of expression of specific voltage- and ligand-gated ionic currents and the first appearance of endogenous and synaptic activity. The first currents occur during midembryogenesis [late stage 16, 13-14 hr after egg laying (AEL)] and consist of a delayed outward potassium current (IK) and an acetylcholine-gated inward cation current (IACh). As development proceeds, other voltage-activated currents arise sequentially. An inward calcium current (ICa) is first observed at 15 hr AEL, an inward sodium current (INa) at 16 hr AEL, and a rapidly inactivating outward potassium current (IA) at 17 hr AEL. The inward calcium current is composed of at least two individual and separable components that exhibit small temporal differences in their development. Endogenous activity is first apparent at 15 hr AEL and consists of small events (peak amplitude, 5 pA) that probably result from the random opening of relatively few numbers of ion channels. At 16 hr AEL, discrete (10-15 msec duration) currents that exhibit larger amplitude (25 pA maximum) and rapid activation but slower inactivation first appear. We identify these latter currents as EPSCs, an indication that functional synaptic transmission is occurring. In the neurons from which we record, action potentials first occur at 17 hr AEL. This study is the first to record from Drosophila embryonic central neurons in vivo and makes possible future work to define the factors that shape the electrical properties of neurons during development.",1998,"M Bate, R A Baines"

Females responded to selection within the first five generations, but a substantial male response was not observed until starvation resistance was assessed at generation 15. By measuring respiration rate in selected and control lines, it was possible to test the hypothesis that reduced metabolic rate is a general mechanism for stress resistance. There was no association between starvation resistance and respiration rate and thus no support for the hypothesis. Studies using vertebrates have shown that starvation causes a decrease in intermediary metabolism enzyme activity, but this relationship is not well documented in invertebrates. In the present study, intermediary metabolism enzyme activities decreased in response to starvation in control-line females and males, and in selected-line males. However, the selected females showed no overall decrease in enzyme activities in response to starvation. One interpretation is that selected females evolved to resist the phenotypic impact of stress.

C. elegans phagocytosis and cell-migration protein CED-5 is similar to human DOCK180,9548255,10.1038/33163,"During programmed cell death, cell corpses are rapidly engulfed.

The expression of human DOCK180 in C. elegans rescued the cell-migration defect of a ced-5 mutant. We present evidence that ced-5 functions in engulfing cells during the engulfment of cell corpses. We suggest that ced-5 acts in the extension of the surface of an engulfing cell around a dying cell during programmed cell death.

Elongation factor-1 alpha occurs as two copies in bees: implications for phylogenetic analysis of EF-1 alpha sequences in insects,9501490,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a025920,"We report the complete sequence of a paralogous copy of elongation factor-1 alpha (EF-1 alpha) in the honeybee, Apis mellifera (Hymenoptera: Apidae). This copy differs from a previously described copy in the positions of five introns and in 25% of the nucleotide sites in the coding regions. The existence of two paralogous copies of EF-1 alpha in Drosophila and Apis suggests that two copies of EF-1 alpha may be widespread in the holometabolous insect orders. To distinguish between a single, ancient gene duplication and parallel, independent fly and bee gene duplications, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of hexapod EF-1 alpha sequences. Unweighted parsimony analysis of nucleotide sequences suggests an ancient gene duplication event, whereas weighted parsimony analysis of nucleotides and unweighted parsimony analysis of amino acids suggests the contrary: that EF-1 alpha underwent parallel gene duplications in the Diptera and the Hymenoptera. The hypothesis of parallel gene duplication is supported both by congruence among nucleotide and amino acid data sets and by topology-dependent permutation tail probability (T-PTP) tests. The resulting tree topologies are also congruent with current views on the relationships among the holometabolous orders included in this study (Diptera, Hymenoptera, and Lepidoptera). More sequences, from diverse orders of holometabolous insects, will be needed to more accurately assess the historical patterns of gene duplication in EF-1 alpha.",1998,"S Ji, B N Danforth"

The sequence included a region similar to a lipase consensus sequence containing the putative active site serine and also included a potential, coiled-coil-forming region. Expression of the open reading frame in COS1 cells resulted in a 20-44-fold increase in phosphatidic acid phospholipase A1 activity over that of control cells. Mutation of the putative active site serine (amino acid 540) demonstrated that it was essential for this increase in enzyme activity. Northern blot analysis revealed at least five different messages with the highest overall message levels in mature testis, but detectable message in all tissues examined. Two possible alternately spliced regions in the open reading frame also were identified.

"hold up is required for establishment of oocyte positioning, follicle cell fate and egg polarity and cooperates with Egfr during Drosophila oogenesis",9504923,,"In Drosophila the posterior positioning of the oocyte within the germline cluster defines the initial asymmetry during oogenesis. From this early event, specification of both body axes is controlled through reciprocal signaling between germline and soma. Here it is shown that the mutation hold up (hup) affects oocyte positioning in the egg chamber, follicle cell fate and localization of different markers in the growing oocytes. This occurs not only in dicephalic egg chambers, but also in oocytes normally located at the posterior. Generation of mosaic egg chambers indicates that hup has to be at least somatically required. Possible interactions of hup with Egfr, the Drosophila epidermal growth factor receptor homolog, have been investigated in homozygous double mutants constructed by recombination. Stronger new ovarian phenotypes have been obtained, the most striking being accumulation of follicle cells in multiple layers posteriorly to the oocyte. It is proposed that the hup gene product is a component of the molecular machinery that leads to the establishment of polarity both in follicle cell layer and oocyte, acting in the same or in a parallel pathway of Egfr.",1998,"C Malva, F Graziani, D Rotoli, S Andone, C Tortiglione, A Manzi"

Recent genetic analyses indicate that the deubiquitinating activity of the fat facets product plays a critical role in controlling the cell fate. We found that Fam accumulated at the cell-cell contact sites of MDCKII cells, but not at free ends of plasma membranes.

Mouse embryos homozygous for loss-of-function alleles of eed initiate gastrulation but display abnormal mesoderm production. Very little embryonic mesoderm is produced; in contrast, extraembryonic mesoderm is relatively abundant. These observations, along with mRNA in situ hybridization analyses, suggested a defect in the anterior primitive streak, from which much of the embryonic mesoderm of the wild-type embryo is derived. To analyse this defect, we initiated clonal analysis of the pre-streak epiblast in eed mutant embryos, using the lineage tracer horseradish peroxidase (HRP). The results of these studies indicate that epiblast cells ingress through the anterior streak, but the newly formed mesoderm does not migrate anteriorly and is mislocalized to the extraembryonic compartment. Abnormal localization of mesoderm to the extraembryonic region did not appear to be due to a restriction and alteration of distal epiblast cell fate, since the majority of clones produced from regions fated to ingress through the anterior streak were mixed, displaying descendants in both embryonic and extraembryonic derivatives. eed mutant embryos also fail to display proper epiblast expansion, particularly with respect to the A-P axis. Based on patterns of clonal spread and calculated clone doubling times for the epiblast, this does not appear to be due to decreased epiblast growth. Rather, epiblast, which is normally fated to make a substantial contribution to the axial midline, appears to make mesoderm preferentially. The data are discussed in terms of global morphogenetic movements in the mouse gastrula and a disruption of signalling activity in the anterior primitive streak.",1998,"N J Schork, K A Lawson, T Magnuson, C Faust, B Thiel"
The spindle is required for the process of sister chromatid separation in Drosophila neuroblasts,1898588,10.1016/0014-4827(91)90150-s,"We have studied two aspects of the process of sister chromatid separation in the Drosophila melanogaster neuroblasts. First, we analyzed the requirement of a functional spindle for sister chromatid separation to take place using microtubule depolymerizing drugs such as colchicine or a reversible analogue (MTC). Incubation of this tissue in colchicine causes the cells to block irreversibly at metaphase and no significant levels of sister chromatid separation were observed even after long periods of incubation. Exposure of neuroblasts to MTC also causes cells to block at metaphase, but after reversion most of the cells enter anaphase and are thus able to complete sister chromatid separation. These results imply that a functional spindle is required for sister chromatid separation. Second, we studied the role of heterochromatin during chromatid pairing and subsequent separation in chromosomes which carry either one or two extra pieces of heterochromatin. The results indicate that sister chromatids establish strong pairing along the translocated heterochromatin. During the early stages of anaphase, these chromosomes separate first the centromeric region and later the regions bearing extra heterochromatin. These results indicate that constitutive heterochromatin plays an important role for sister chromatid pairing and might be involved in the process of separation.",1991,"C E Sunkel, C Gonzalez, P Ripoll, J Casal Jimenez"
"Genetic and cytogenetic analysis of the ""Th-Ps"" region of the Y chromosome of Drosophila hydei: evidence for dual functions of the lampbrush loop-forming fertility genes?",2062310,10.1007/BF00259683,"Two competing hypotheses have been proposed for the function of the Y chromosomal fertility factors in Drosophila, which form giant lampbrush loops during the primary spermatocyte stage. The first hypothesis suggests a conventional coding function, the second proposes an unconventional gene function mediated through protein binding by nascent transcripts. Therefore, we studied the genetics and cytogenetics of the two Y chromosomal fertility genes A and C of Drosophila hydei (which form the lampbrush loops threads and pseudonucleolus) in order to test the validity of these different hypotheses. Both lampbrush loops bind specific proteins, which are recognized by different antisera. Absence of either of the lampbrush loops does not interfere with the synthesis of the antigens but completely prevents the binding of the particular antigen to other lampbrush loops. Absence of the loops also does not interfere with the postmeiotic presence and localization of the particular antigen. Deletion (or inactivation) of either of the lampbrush loops threads or pseudonucleolus causes sterility of the male flies as do other male-sterile alleles of both fertility genes, which do not affect the morphology of the lampbrush loops. The phenotypic effects of these mutations on sperm morphogenesis are identical for all various male-sterile alleles of each of the fertility genes A and C, regardless of whether a particular allele leaves the loop intact, modifies that loop, or deletes (or inactivates) the loop completely. Finally, the isolation of fertile Y chromosomal mutations which modify the morphology of the lampbrush loops demonstrates that it is possible to uncouple loop morphology and genetic function. These findings do not support the hypothesis that the binding of proteins to a lampbrush loop has a substantial impact on spermiogenesis.",1991,"J H Hackstein, T J Hulsebos, K H Glätzer"
Heat shock protein 88 and Aspergillus infection,1939562,10.1128/JCM.29.10.2099-2106.1991,"Immunoblotting was used to dissect the antibody responses in the sera of 50 patients with proven invasive aspergillosis, 28 patients with suspected invasive aspergillosis, 35 patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, and 10 patients with an aspergilloma. This demonstrated the immunodominance of antigenic bands at 88, 84, 51, and 40 kDa. Monoclonal antibodies against the heat shock protein 90 complexes of Candida albicans and the water mold Achlya ambisexualis identified these four antigenic bands as homologous proteins. Similar antigens have been described in humans, mice, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, chickens, and Drosophila species. The antibody against A. ambisexualis has previously been shown to cross-react with antigens belonging to the human heat shock protein 90 complex. Aspergillus heat shock protein 90 was extracted from the sera of patients with invasive aspergillosis by affinity chromatography. This was done with both a rabbit hyperimmune antiserum raised against an extract of Aspergillus fumigatus NCPF 2109 and a monoclonal antibody against the heat shock protein 90 of C. albicans.

Identification and purification of a yeast protein that affects elongation by RNA polymerase II,1851172,,"We have purified from whole cell extracts of Saccharomyces cerevisiae a protein which alters the elongation properties of yeast RNA polymerase II in vitro. The yeast elongation stimulatory activity, YES, correlates with a 116-kDa protein and acts on both yeast and Drosophila RNA polymerase II during transcription of double-stranded dC-tailed templates. The stimulatory activity is specific for RNA polymerase II since it has no significant effect on the elongation properties of yeast RNA polymerase I or yeast RNA polymerase III. Elongation by RNA polymerase II can be stimulated by RNase H on dC-tailed templates; however, the stimulatory activity of YES is not due to RNase H activity. YES does not stimulate RNA polymerase II in the presence of manganese ions and therefore is distinct from the smaller elongation factor, S-II or DmS-II. YES is most similar to Drosophila factor 5 (mammalian TFIIF, or RAP30/74), an initiation factor that is also able to increase the rate of elongation of RNA polymerase II.",1991,"D H Price, D R Chafin, T J Claussen"
"A highly repetitive, mariner-like element in the genome of Hyalophora cecropia",1646809,,"A highly repetitive DNA element, homologous to the mariner transposon of Drosophila mauritiana was found in the intron of the gene for cecropin A, an antibacterial peptide from the Cecropia moth. The mariner-like elements (MLE) represent a homogeneous population with a copy number of about 1000/genome. Sequencing analysis showed it to be 1255 base pairs long, including 38-base pair terminal inverted repeats. The MLE contains a defective reading frame. Nevertheless, the putative product is clearly homologous to the predicted translation product encoded by mariner. In consonance is also the fact that the inverted repeats are highly conserved between the two elements and that the overall DNA homology is 48%. Since the mariner element is present in several Drosophila species closely related to Drosophila melanogaster and since MLE is present in the lepidopteran Cecropia, a route of horizontal transfer is indicated rather than vertical transmission from a common ancestor. This suggests the possible use of mariner for the construction of an interspecies vector.",1991,"G H Gudmundsson, D A Lidholm, H G Boman"
The distribution of actin immunoreactivity in rhabdomeres of tipulid flies in relation to extracellular membrane shedding,1786593,10.1007/BF00340869,"Rhabdomeres of tipulid flies lose membrane during turnover from a 'shedding zone' composed of microvillar tips. These distal domains lack intramicrovillar cytoskeletons and appear to be empty sacs of membrane. Recent concerns about the role of ninaC mechano-enzymes in the architecture of dipteran rhabdomeral microvilli and the dynamic role that they may play in the creation of shedding zones demand an examination of the distribution of actin in tipulid rhabdomeres. We compared rhabdomeres from tipulid retinae incubated before fixation for immunocytochemistry in a buffer without additives and a stabilising buffer that contained a cocktail of cysteine protease inhibitors; both were challenged by an anti-actin antibody for immunogold labelling after embedding in LR White Resin. Shedding zones thus processed collapse to structureless detritus. Stabilised and unstabilized shedding zones were immunonegative to anti-actin. To ensure that the negative results were not consequent upon conformational changes generated by the processing protocol, we examined microvilli of degenerating rhabdomeres of the Drosophila light-dependent retinal degeneration mutant rdgBKS222 (which separate and collapse without creating a shedding zone) and found the detritus they generate to be immunopositive to anti-actin. Stabilised and unstabilized regions of basal regions of tipulid rhabdomeres were equally immunopositive. We infer that (a) actin is absent from shedding zones; (b) actin is not degraded by microvillar cysteine proteases. The implications of these conclusions are discussed in relation to some functional models of arthropod photoreceptor microvilli.",1991,"M Carter, A D Blest, S Stowe, J A Clausen"
Key residues involved in calcium-binding motifs in EGF-like domains,2030732,10.1038/351164a0,"Many extracellular proteins with diverse functions contain domains similar to epidermal growth factor (EGF), a number of which have a consensus Asp/Asn, Asp/Asn, Asp*/Asn*, Tyr/Phe (where the asterisk denotes a beta-hydroxylated residue). These include the coagulation factors IX and X, proteins with two EGF-like domains, the first of which contains the consensus residues. The first EGF-like domain of human factor IX contains a calcium-binding site, which is believed to be responsible for one of the high-affinity sites detected in this protein. Similar results have been obtained for bovine factor X. We have now used protein engineering and 1H-NMR techniques to investigate the importance of individual consensus residues for ligand binding. Measurement of a calcium-dependent Tyr 69 shift in the isolated first EGF-like domain from human factor IX demonstrates that Asp 47, Asp 49, and Asp 64 are directly involved in this binding. Gln 50, whose importance has previously been overlooked, is also involved in this binding. Two mutations in this domain, Asp 47----Glu, and Asp 64----Asn, present in patients with haemophilia B, reduce calcium binding to the domain greater than 4-fold and greater than 1,000-fold, respectively. Furthermore, the defective calcium binding of Asn 64 can be partially rescued by the compensatory mutation Gln 50----Glu. This latter mutation, when introduced singly more than doubles the affinity of the domain for calcium. This study thus defines residues involved in a new type of calcium-binding site and provides strong circumstantial evidence for calcium-binding motifs in many extracellular proteins, including the developmentally important proteins of Drosophila, notch, delta and crumbs.",1991,"M Mayhew, P R Winship, I D Campbell, M Baron, P A Handford, G G Brownlee"
"Characterization of Andante, a new Drosophila clock mutant, and its interactions with other clock mutants",2030465,10.3109/01677069109066214,"A new clock mutant, named Andante, has been identified on the X chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster. Andante lengthens the period of the circadian eclosion and locomotor activity rhythms by 1.5-2.0 hours. The phase response curves for the eclosion and activity rhythms, indicating light-induced phase shifts, show a similar degree of lengthening. Andante also lengthens the periods of other clock mutants, including Clock, and alleles of the period locus. Analysis of locomotor activity rhythms reveals that Andante is semi-dominant, and Andante rhythms are highly temperature compensated. The sine oculis mutation, which eliminates the outer visual system, has no effect on the period of Andante. Deficiency mapping indicates that Andante is located in the 1OE1-2 to 1OF1 region of the X chromosome, close to the miniature-dusky locus.

The next five (5) most commonly used assays were in vitro cytogenetics (72%), in vivo cytogenetics (59%), CHO HGPRT gene mutation (55%), the micronucleus assay (53%), and L517BY gene mutation (45%). 3. The assay showing the greatest percentage increase in routine use was the micronucleus assay which went from 14% in 1984 to 34% in 1986, an increase of 20%. 4. Other assays which increased in routine use were CHO HGPRT mutation (+18%); in vitro cytogenetics (+14%); L5178Y gene mutation (+9%), and the Ames assay (+5%). 5. Routine use of in vitro UDS assays declined by 6%; use of in vitro SCE assays declined by 12%. 6. There was no change in the rate of routine use of in vivo cytogenetics or in vivo SCE assays. 7.

"Jack of one trade, master of none: host choice by Drosophila magnaquinaria",28313208,10.1007/BF00317538,"Host selection by phytophagous insects is generally thought to be based on chemical or nutritional characteristics of the host. This is especially true for monophagous insects. However, many other factors may influence host choice. The present study examines host selection by Drosophila magnaquinaria, whose sole host is the yellow skunk cabbage, Lysichitum americanum. Utilization of skunk cabbage was tested relative to a set of alternative hosts. In the pre-alighting stage of host selection, skunk cabbage was found to be less attractive than tomato, cucumber, and commercial mushrooms. In pairwise oviposition tests, there were no differences among hosts. There were no differences in larval survivorship among skunk cabbage, tomato, cucumber, or Ramaria, and larvae developed into pupae earlier on tomato than on skunk cabbage. These results indicate that this monophagy is not based on characteristics of the host. We suggest that habitat selection is the more important factor in determining the association between D. magnaquinaria and skunk cabbage.",1991,"T T Kibota, S P Courtney"
An adult male specific gene in Drosophila containing the repetitive element opa,1883837,10.1016/0167-4781(91)90045-n,"A cDNA has been isolated for an adult male specific gene in Drosophila that contains the repetitive element opa. We have named this gene Dromsopa for Drosophila male specific opa containing gene. The 0.6 kb mRNA for this gene is only found in the abdominal region of adult male Drosophila and in no other tissue or at other developmental stages. The Dromsopa opa repeat codes for the usual stretch of poly(glutamine) interrupted by histidine residues. The opa repetitive element was originally found in the Drosophila Notch gene (Kidd, S. et al. (1983) Cell 34, 431-433 and Wharton, K.A. (1985) Cell 40, 55-62) and has, more recently, been found in genes under developmental or tissue specific control from yeast to humans.

Inferring the evolutionary histories of the Adh and Adh-dup loci in Drosophila melanogaster from patterns of polymorphism and divergence,1673107,,"The DNA sequences of 11 Drosophila melanogaster lines are compared across three contiguous regions, the Adh and Adh-dup loci and a noncoding 5' flanking region of Adh. Ninety-eight of approximately 4750 sites are segregating in the sample, 36 in the 5' flanking region, 38 in Adh and 24 in Adh-dup. Several methods are presented to test whether the patterns and levels of polymorphism are consistent with neutral molecular evolution. The analysis of within- and between-species polymorphism indicates that the region is evolving in a nonneutral and complex fashion. A graphical analysis of the data provides support for a hypothesized balanced polymorphism at or near position 1490, site of the amino acid replacement difference between Adhf and Adhs. The Adh-dup locus is less polymorphic than Adh and all 24 of its polymorphisms occur at low frequency--suggestive of a recent selective substitution in the Adh-dup region. Adhs alleles form two distinct evolutionary lineages that differ one from another at a total of nineteen sites in the Adh and Adh-dup loci. The polymorphisms are in complete linkage disequilibrium. A recombination experiment failed to find evidence for recombination suppression between the two allelic classes. Two hypotheses are presented to account for the widespread distribution of the two divergent lineages in natural populations. Natural selection appears to have played an important role in governing the overall patterns of nucleotide variation across the two-gene region.",1991,"M Kreitman, R R Hudson"
Three neighboring genes interact with the Broad-Complex and the Stubble-stubbloid locus to affect imaginal disc morphogenesis in Drosophila,1903118,,"The Broad-Complex (BR-C) is a complex regulatory locus at 2B-5 on the X chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster. The wild-type BR-C products are apparent transcription factors necessary for imaginal disc morphogenesis. Alleles of the Stubble-stubbloid (Sb-sbd) locus at 89B9-10 act as dominant enhancers of broad alleles of the BR-C. Sb-sbd wild-type products are necessary for appendage elongation. We report, here, on three new loci implicated in imaginal disc morphogenesis based on their genetic interactions with both BR-C and/or Sb-sbd mutants. Enhancer of broad (E(br)) was identified as a dominant enhancer of the br1 allele of the BR-C and is a recessive lethal. Mapping of E(br) has led to the identification of two loci, blistered and l(2)B485, mutants of which interact with E(br) and the Sb-sbd locus. Blistered, but not l(2)B485, interacts strongly with the BR-C. Alleles of the blistered locus are viable and disrupt proper wing disc morphogenesis independent of genetic interactions. All three loci map within the 0.6-map unit interval between the genetic markers speck and Irregular facets and to the cytological region 60C5-6; 60E9-10 at the tip of chromosome 2R.

"Definition of a consensus sequence for peptide substrate recognition by p44mpk, the meiosis-activated myelin basic protein kinase",1907971,,"Synthetic peptides have been used to define the consensus amino acid sequence for substrate recognition by the meiosis-activated myelin basic protein (MBP) kinase (p44mpk), which was purified from maturing sea star oocytes. This protein kinase shares many properties with the mitogen-activated microtubule-associated protein-2 kinase (p42mapk) in vertebrates. Recently, Thr-97 in the tryptic fragment KNIVTPRTPPPSQGK of bovine MBP was identified as the major site of phosphorylation by p44mpk (Sanghera, J. S., Aebersold, R., Morrison, H. D., Bures, E. J., and Pelech, S. L. (1990) FEBS Lett. 273, 223-226). Synthetic peptides modeled after this sequence revealed that the presence of a proline residue C-terminal (+1 position) to the phosphorylatable threonine (or serine) residue was critical for recognition by p44mpk. Although not essential, a proline residue located at the -2 position enhanced the Vmax of peptide phosphorylation. Basic, acidic, and non-polar residues were equally tolerated at the -1 position. The presence of an amino acid residue at position -3 also increased peptide phosphorylation. Thus, the optimum consensus sequence for phosphorylation by p44mpk was defined as Pro-X-(Ser/Thr)-Pro, where X is a variable amino acid residue, but ideally not a Pro. Peptides that included this sequence were phosphorylated by p44mpk with Vmax values approaching 1 mumol.min-1.mg-1 and with apparent Km values of approximately 1 mM). Pseudosubstrate peptides in which the phosphorylatable residue was replaced by valine or alanine were weak inhibitors of p44mpk (apparent Ki values of approximately 3 mM). Over 40 distinct protein kinases contain Pro-X-(Ser/Thr)-Pro sequences including the human receptors for insulin and epidermal growth factor, and kinases encoded by the human proto-oncogenes abl, neu, and raf-1, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe cell cycle control genes ran-1 and wee-1.

Comparison of mitochondrial DNA sequences of seven morphospecies of black flies (Diptera: Simuliidae),2055453,10.1139/g91-050,"Universal primers constructed from the 16S ribosomal RNA gene in the Drosophila yakuba mitochondrial genome were successfully used to amplify, via the polymerase chain reaction, the homologous region of mitochondrial DNA from seven black fly morphospecies. Amplification was achieved from single larval salivary glands and from single adults preserved in Carnoy's fixative (ethanol - acetic acid, 3:1), allowing DNA sequences and polytene chromosome banding pattern data to be gathered from the same individuals. Nucleotide sequences of the amplified DNA segment (347 base pairs) were obtained from all the species examined. As in Drosophila, the nucleotide base composition of the sequenced segment from black flies had a high adenine (A) and thymine (T) content (A + T on average comprised 77% of all nucleotides.). Nucleotide differences among the seven species were observed at 59 positions (55 nucleotide substitutions and 4 deletions). There were more transversion differences than transition differences both among and within genera; the proportion of transversions was higher between genera than within genera. Most transversion differences were A----T type, comprising 79% of all transversion differences and 50% of all sequence differences.

YY1 is an initiator sequence-binding protein that directs and activates transcription in vitro,1720509,10.1038/354241a0,"Regulation of eukaryotic messenger RNA transcription is governed by DNA sequence elements that serve as binding sites for sequence-specific transcription factors. These include upstream and downstream promoter-proximal elements, enhancers, repressors, and silencers, which modulate the rate of specific initiation by RNA polymerase II.

Although the TATA element-binding factor TFIID has been purified and cloned from several organisms and has provided invaluable insight into the process of transcription initiation and its regulation, little is known about factors that interact at the +1 region. We have recently shown that the adeno-associated virus type 2 P5 promoter +1 region (P5 + 1 element) binds transcription factor YY1. We report here that this sequence is necessary and sufficient for accurate basal transcription. Further, partially purified YY1 can restore basal level transcription from a P5 + 1 element in a HeLa extract depleted for YY1 or a Drosophila embryo extract devoid of YY1 activity, whereas a YY1-specific antibody can block the reactivation.

High levels of recombination induced by homologous P elements in Drosophila melanogaster,1850087,10.1007/BF00261685,"P element transposons in Drosophila melanogaster are capable of mobilizing incomplete P elements elsewhere in the genome, and of inducing recombination. This recombination is usually only of the order of 1% or less. We show that two P elements, located at exactly homologous sites, induce levels of recombination of 20% or higher. The recombination appears to be exact, as determined by the lack of phenotypic effects in recombinant products and the lack of size changes detectable by Southern hybridization. Female recombination is increased, but to a lesser extent than male recombination. Somatic recombination levels are also elevated. Alternative explanations for the high recombination levels are given in terms of the consequences of repair of an excision site and in terms of recombination as part of the replicative transposition process.",1991,"L M Blackman, W R Engels, J A Sved, A S Gilchrist"

Intracellular transport of MHC class II and associated invariant chain in antigen presenting cells from AP-3-deficient mocha mice,11520080,10.1006/cimm.2001.1817,"MHC class II-restricted antigen presentation requires trafficking of newly synthesized class II-invariant chain complexes from the trans-Golgi network to endosomal, peptide-loading compartments.

In this report, we have assessed class II-invariant chain trafficking in a strain of mice (mocha) which lacks expression of AP-3. Our studies demonstrate that the lack of AP-3 does not affect the kinetics of invariant chain degradation, the route of class II-invariant chain transport, or the rate and extent of class II-peptide binding as assessed by the generation of SDS-stable dimers.

We now report that DmGSTS1-1 isolated from Drosophila or expressed in Escherichia coli is essentially inactive toward the commonly used synthetic substrate 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB), but has relatively high glutathione-conjugating activity for 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), an electrophilic aldehyde derived from lipid peroxidation. 4-HNE is thought to have signaling functions and, at higher concentrations, has been shown to be cytotoxic and involved in the etiology of various degenerative diseases. Drosophila strains carrying P-element insertions in the GstS1 gene have a reduced capacity for glutathione conjugation of 4-HNE. In flies with both, one, or none of the GstS1 alleles disrupted by P-element insertion, there is a linear correlation between DmGSTS1-1 protein content and 4-HNE-conjugating activity. This correlation indicates that in adult Drosophila 70 +/- 6% of the capacity to conjugate 4-HNE is attributable to DmGSTS1-1. The high abundance of DmGSTS1-1 (approximately 2% of the soluble protein in adult flies) and its previously reported localization in tissues that are either highly aerobic (indirect flight muscle) or especially sensitive to oxidative damage (neuronal tissue) suggest that the enzyme may have a protective role against deleterious effects of oxidative stress. Such function in insects would be analogous to that carried out in mammals by specialized alpha class glutathione S-transferases (e.g. GSTA4-4). The independent emergence of 4-HNE-conjugating activity in more than one branch of the glutathione S-transferase superfamily suggests that 4-HNE catabolism may be essential for aerobic life.",2001,"P Zimniak, B J Cochrane, H Benes, S P Singh, J A Coronella"
"Characterization of mouse Dach2, a homologue of Drosophila dachshund",11287190,10.1016/s0925-4773(01)00307-0,"The Drosophila genes eyeless, eyes absent, sine oculis and dachshund cooperate as components of a network to control retinal determination. Vertebrate homologues of these genes have been identified and implicated in the control of cell fate. We present the cloning and characterization of mouse Dach2, a homologue of dachshund. In situ hybridization studies demonstrate Dach2 expression in embryonic nervous tissues, sensory organs and limbs. This pattern is similar to mouse Dach1, suggesting a partially redundant role for these genes during development. In addition, we determine that Dach2 expression in the forebrain of Pax6 mutants and dermamyotome of Pax3 mutants is not detectably altered. Finally, genetic mapping experiments place mouse Dach2 on the X chromosome between Xist and Esx1.

Evolution tunes the excitability of individual neurons,11301195,10.1016/s0306-4522(01)00079-3,"The relationship between the genome and the evolution of the nervous system may differ between an animal like C. elegans with 302 neurons, and mammals with tens of billions of neurons. Here we report that a class of nonconserved potassium channels highly expanded in C. elegans may play a special role in the evolution of its nervous system. The C. elegans genome contains an extended gene family of potassium channels whose members fall into two evolutionary divergent classes. One class constitutes an ancient conserved ""set"" of K+ channels with orthologues in both humans and Drosophila and a second larger class made up of rapidly evolving genes unique to C. elegans. Chief among this second class are novel potassium channels having four transmembrane domains per subunit that function as regulated leak conductances to modulate cell electrical excitability. This inventory of novel potassium channels is far larger in C. elegans than in humans or Drosophila. We found that, unlike conserved channel genes, the majority of these genes are expressed in very few cells. We also identified DNA enhancer elements associated with these genes that direct gene expression to individual neurons. We conclude that C. elegans may maintain an exceptionally large inventory of these channels (as well as ligand-gated channels) as an adaptive mechanism to ""fine tune"" individual neurons, making the most of its limited circuitry.",2001,"N Walton, L Salkoff, G Fawcett, C McArdle, Z W Wang, M Nonet, A Butler, M Kunkel, G Paz-y-Mino, A Yuan, A Wei"
The ecdysteroid agonist/antagonist and brassinosteroid-like activities of synthetic brassinosteroid/ecdysteroid hybrid molecules,11529505,10.1007/PL00000927,"A series of synthetic hybrid brassinosteroid/ecdysteroid structures has been assessed for their ecdysteroid agonist/antagonist activities in the Drosophila melanogaster B(II) cell bioassay and for brassinosteroid-like activity in the rice lamina inclination test. Most of the compounds proved inactive for ecdysteroid agonist activity, demonstrating the specificity of the ecdysteroid receptor for compounds closely structurally related to 20-hydroxyecdysone. However, compound 18, with 14alpha-hydroxy-7-en-6-one and 22S-hydroxy functionalities (as in most active ecdysteroids), possessed distinct agonist activity (median effective concentration = 1.4 x 10(-5) M), although this is still almost 2000-fold less active than 20-hydroxyecdysone (25). Compounds 13 and 15 possessed weak agonist activity. Compounds 5, 11 and 14 weakly antagonised the action of 20-hydroxyecdysone (at 5 x 10(-8) M) on B(II) cells. In the brassinosteroid bioassay, most of the tested compounds showed activity. This may reflect the metabolic capability of plant tissue to convert test compounds to more active analogues. However, it is clear that biological activity declines as the structure of the test compound deviates further from that of castasterone (16). Three ecdysteroids (25, 26 and 27) are completely inactive in the rice lamina inclination test. These studies demonstrate the high specificities of the insect ecdysteroid receptor and the plant brassinosteroid receptor and indicate that phytoecdysteroids, even in high concentrations, would not interfere with brassinosteroid signalling pathways in plants where the two classes of compounds co-occur. Equally, brassinosteroids would not interfere with ecdysteroid signalling in insects, especially if one takes into account the low concentrations of brassinosteroids in the diet of phytophagous insects.",2001,"P Whiting, B Voigt, L Dinan"

Here, we describe a Drosophila homolog of human SAP18, a member of the Sin3A/Rpd3 histone deacetylase complex. dSAP18 interacts with Bicoid in yeast and in vitro, and is expressed early in development coincident with Bicoid. In tissue culture cells, dSAP18 inhibits the ability of Bicoid to activate reporter genes.

These flies have eyes laterally displaced at the end of eyestalks, and males have greatly exaggerated eye span, which they use as a sexual display. To investigate eye span development we have compared eye-antennal disc morphology and the expression of three key regulator genes of Drosophila head development, Distal-less (Dll), engrailed (en), and wingless (wg), in the stalk-eyed flies and Drosophila. We found great similarity in the basic division of the disc into anterior-antennal and posterior-eye portions and in the general patterning of Dll, en, and wg. Unexpectedly, our results showed that although the eye and antenna are adjacent in adult stalk-eyed flies, their primordia are physically separated by the presence of an intervening region between the anterior and posterior portions of the disc. This region is absent from Drosophila eye-antennal discs. We chose two stalk-eyed fly species that differed in the degree of eye-stalk exaggeration but surprisingly we found no corresponding difference in the size of the en-wg expression domains that mark the boundaries of the dorsal head capsule primordia.

RhPV has a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome of about 10 kb; unlike the genomes of Picornaviridae, however, this genome contains two long open reading frames (ORFs). ORF1 encodes the virus nonstructural proteins, while the downstream ORF, ORF2, specifies the structural proteins. Both ORFs are preceded by long untranslated regions (UTRs). The intergenic UTR is known to contain an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) which directs non-AUG-initiated translation of ORF2. We have examined the 5' UTR of RhPV for IRES activity by translating synthetic dicistronic mRNAs containing this sequence in a variety of systems. We now report that the 5' UTR contains an element which directs internal initiation of protein synthesis from an AUG codon in mammalian, plant, and Drosophila in vitro translation systems. In contrast, the encephalomyocarditis virus IRES functions only in the mammalian system.

Hes1 and Hes5 activities are required for the normal development of the hair cells in the mammalian inner ear,11425898,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.21-13-04712.2001,"The mammalian inner ear contains two sensory organs, the cochlea and vestibule. Their sensory neuroepithelia are characterized by a mosaic of hair cells and supporting cells. Cochlear hair cells differentiate in four rows: a single row of inner hair cells (IHCs) and three rows of outer hair cells (OHCs). Recent studies have shown that Math1, a mammalian homolog of Drosophila atonal is a positive regulator of hair cell differentiation. The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) genes Hes1 and Hes5 (mammalian hairy and Enhancer-of-split homologs) can influence cell fate determination by acting as negative regulators to inhibit the action of bHLH-positive regulators. We show by using reverse transcription-PCR analysis that Hes1, Hes5, and Math1 are expressed in the developing mouse cochleae. In situ hybridization revealed a widespread expression of Hes1 in the greater epithelial ridge (GER) and in lesser epithelial ridge (LER) regions. Hes5 is predominantly expressed in the LER, in supporting cells, and in a narrow band of cells within the GER. Examination of cochleae from Hes1(-/-) mice showed a significant increase in the number of IHCs, whereas cochleae from Hes5(-/-) mice showed a significant increase in the number of OHCs. In the vestibular system, targeted deletion of Hes1 and to a lesser extent Hes5 lead to formation of supernumerary hair cells in the saccule and utricle. The supernumerary hair cells in the mutant mice showed an upregulation of Math1. These data indicate that Hes1 and Hes5 participate together for the control of inner ear hair cell production, likely through the negative regulation of Math1.",2001,"A Zine, A Aubert, R Kageyama, F Guillemot, F de Ribaupierre, J Qiu, S Therianos"
Analysis of corkscrew signaling in the Drosophila epidermal growth factor receptor pathway during myogenesis,11729154,,"The Drosophila nonreceptor protein tyrosine phosphatase, Corkscrew (Csw), functions positively in multiple receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) pathways, including signaling by the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Detailed phenotypic analyses of csw mutations have revealed that Csw activity is required in many of the same developmental processes that require EGFR function. However, it is still unclear where in the signaling hierarchy Csw functions relative to other proteins whose activities are also required downstream of the receptor. To address this issue, genetic interaction experiments were performed to place csw gene activity relative to the EGFR, spitz (spi), rhomboid (rho), daughter of sevenless (DOS), kinase-suppressor of ras (ksr), ras1, D-raf, pointed (pnt), and moleskin. We followed the EGFR-dependent formation of VA2 muscle precursor cells as a sensitive assay for these genetic interaction studies. First, we established that Csw has a positive function during mesoderm development. Second, we found that tissue-specific expression of a gain-of-function csw construct rescues loss-of-function mutations in other positive signaling genes upstream of rolled (rl)/MAPK in the EGFR pathway. Third, we were able to infer levels of EGFR signaling in various mutant backgrounds during myogenesis.

Electron microscope mapping of the pericentric and intercalary heterochromatic regions of the polytene chromosomes of the mutant Suppressor of underreplication in Drosophila melanogaster,11862456,10.1007/s004120100164,"Breaks and ectopic contacts in the heterochromatic regions of Drosophila melanogaster polytene chromosomes are the manifestations of the cytological effects of DNA underreplication. Their appearance makes these regions difficult to map. The Su(UR)ES gene, which controls the phenomenon, has been described recently. Mutation of this locus gives rise to new blocks of material in the pericentric heterochromatic regions and causes the disappearance of breaks and ectopic contacts in the intercalary heterochromatic regions, thereby making the banding pattern distinct and providing better opportunities for mapping of the heterochromatic regions in polytene chromosomes. Here, we present the results of an electron microscope study of the heterochromatic regions. In the wild-type salivary glands, the pericentric regions correspond to the beta-heterochromatin and do not show the banding pattern. The most conspicuous cytological effect of the Su(UR)ES mutation is the formation of a large banded chromosome fragment comprising at least 25 bands at the site where the 3L and 3R proximal arms connect. In the other pericentric regions, 20CF, 40BF and 41BC, 15, 12 and 9 new bands were revealed, respectively. A large block of densely packed material appears in the most proximal part of the fourth chromosome. An electron microscope analysis of 26 polytene chromosome regions showing the characteristic features of intercalary heterochromatin was also performed.

Regulation of the cycling of timeless (tim) RNA,11333398,10.1002/neu.1024,"Circadian rhythms in Drosophila depend upon expression of the timeless (tim) and period (per) genes, which encode interacting components of the endogenous clock. These two clock genes show a robust circadian oscillation in transcription rate as well as RNA and protein levels. Transcriptional activation of both genes requires the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) PAS transcription factors dCLOCK (dCLK) and CYCLE (CYC), which bind E-box elements. We investigated the role of E-box elements in regulating behavioral rhythmicity and tim gene expression. We show that mutation of the upstream E-box in the tim gene prevents the rescue by tim cDNA sequences of the arrhythmic tim(01) phenotype. RNA encoded by this mutated tim transgene fails to cycle and is expressed at low levels. While a tim transgene carrying a wild-type E-box restores behavioral rhythms, tim RNA levels are intermediate to those of the mutant E-box transgenic lines and wild type, and do not display high amplitude cycling. On the other hand, high-amplitude RNA cycling was consistently obtained with a tim transgene that contains genomic, rather than cDNA, sequences. To identify additional sequences that may be required for tim cycling, we investigated the role of an E-box in the first intron of the tim gene through cell culture experiments. In these experiments, the presence of this intron did not have any effect on the activation of tim transcription by dCLK/CYC. As the upstream E-box was implicated in activation by dCLK/CYC in cell culture, we assayed sequences containing this E-box for association with proteins in fly head extracts. These studies provide the first biochemical evidence for an in vivo complex containing dCLK and CYC that binds the tim upstream sequence and is detected at all times of day. Together, these data highlight molecular mechanisms that are critical for behavioral rhythms.",2001,"G K Wang, W Fu, A Sehgal, S A Kay, D Chen, L J Hickman, Y Chen, A Ousley, T K Darlington"
Peripheral glia direct axon guidance across the CNS/PNS transition zone,11783993,10.1006/dbio.2001.0411,"CNS glia have integral roles in directing axon migration of both vertebrates and insects. In contrast, very little is known about the roles of PNS glia in axonal pathfinding. In vertebrates and Drosophila, anatomical evidence shows that peripheral glia prefigure the transition zones through which axons migrate into and out of the CNS. Therefore, peripheral glia could guide axons at the transition zone. We used the Drosophila model system to test this hypothesis by ablating peripheral glia early in embryonic neurodevelopment via targeted overexpression of cell death genes grim and ced-3. The effects of peripheral glial loss on sensory and motor neuron development were analyzed. Motor axons initially exit the CNS in abnormal patterns in the absence of peripheral glia. However, they must use other cues within the periphery to find their correct target muscles since early pathfinding errors are largely overcome. When peripheral glia are lost, sensory axons show disrupted migration as they travel centrally. This is not a result of motor neuron defects, as determined by motor/sensory double-labeling experiments. We conclude that peripheral glia prefigure the CNS/PNS transition zone and guide axons as they traverse this region.",2001,"J Schulte, V J Auld, K J Sepp"
Erk MAP kinase regulates branching morphogenesis in the developing mouse kidney,11684667,,"Branching morphogenesis of epithelium is a common and important feature of organogenesis; it is, for example, responsible for development of renal collecting ducts, lung airways, milk ducts of mammary glands and seminal ducts of the prostate. In each case, epithelial development is controlled by a variety of mesenchyme-derived molecules, both soluble (e.g. growth factors) and insoluble (e.g. extracellular matrix). Little is known about how these varied influences are integrated to produce a coherent morphogenetic response, but integration is likely to be achieved at least partly by cytoplasmic signal transduction networks. Work in other systems (Drosophila tracheae, MDCK models) suggests that the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway might be important to epithelial branching. We have investigated the role of the MAP kinase pathway in one of the best characterised mammalian examples of branching morphogenesis, the ureteric bud of the metanephric kidney. We find that Erk MAP kinase is normally active in ureteric bud, and that inhibiting Erk activation with the MAP kinase kinase inhibitor, PD98059, reversibly inhibits branching in a dose-dependent manner, while allowing tubule elongation to continue. When Erk activation is inhibited, ureteric bud tips show less cell proliferation than controls and they also produce fewer laminin-rich processes penetrating the mesenchyme and fail to show the strong concentration of apical actin filaments typical of controls; apoptosis and expression of Ret and Ros, are, however, normal. The activity of the Erk MAP kinase pathway is dependent on at least two known regulators of ureteric bud branching; the GDNF-Ret signalling system and sulphated glycosaminoglycans. MAP kinase is therefore essential for normal branching morphogenesis of the ureteric bud, and lies downstream of significant extracellular regulators of ureteric bud development.",2001,"C E Fisher, L Michael, M W Barnett, J A Davies"

They act by regulating actin-filament geometry, antagonizing the effects of actin-capping protein [5]. Embryos lacking the C. elegans Ena/VASP, UNC-34, display subtle defects in the leading edges of migrating epidermal cells but undergo normal epidermal morphogenesis. In contrast, embryos lacking both UNC-34 and the C. elegans N-WASP homolog have severe defects in epidermal morphogenesis, suggesting that they have parallel roles in coordinating cell behavior. GFP-tagged UNC-34 localizes to the leading edges of migrating epidermal cells, becoming redistributed to new junctions that form during epidermal-sheet sealing. Consistent with this, UNC-34 contributes to the formation of cadherin-based junctions. The junctional localization of UNC-34 is independent of proteins involved in Ena/VASP localization in other experimental systems; instead, junctional distribution depends upon the junctional protein AJM-1. We also show that Abelson tyrosine kinase, a major regulator of Enabled in Drosophila, is not required for UNC-34/Ena function in epithelia.

These ems-expressing neuronal cells are located ventral to the antennal lobes and project a fascicle to the superior medial protocerebrum. All adult-specific secondary neurons in this lineage persistently express ems during postembryonic larval development and continue to do so throughout metamorphosis and into the adult. Mosaic-based MARCM mutant analysis and genetic rescue experiments demonstrate that ems function is autonomously required for the correct number of cells in the persistently expressing adult-specific lineage. Moreover, they indicate that ems is also required cell autonomously for the formation of the correct projections in this specific lineage.

Hu proteins regulate polyadenylation by blocking sites containing U-rich sequences,17127772,10.1074/jbc.M609349200,"A recent genome-wide bioinformatic analysis indicated that 54% of human genes undergo alternative polyadenylation. Although it is clear that differential selection of poly(A) sites can alter gene expression, resulting in significant biological consequences, the mechanisms that regulate polyadenylation are poorly understood. Here we report that the neuron-specific members of a family of RNA-binding proteins, Hu proteins, known to regulate mRNA stability and translation in the cytoplasm, play an important role in polyadenylation regulation. Hu proteins are homologs of the Drosophila embryonic lethal abnormal visual protein and contain three RNA recognition motifs. Using an in vitro polyadenylation assay with HeLa cell nuclear extract and recombinant Hu proteins, we have shown that Hu proteins selectively block both cleavage and poly(A) addition at sites containing U-rich sequences. Hu proteins have no effect on poly(A) sites that do not contain U-rich sequences or sites in which the U-rich sequences are mutated. All three RNA recognition motifs of Hu proteins are required for this activity. Overexpression of HuR in HeLa cells also blocks polyadenylation at a poly(A) signal that contains U-rich sequences. Hu proteins block the interaction between the polyadenylation cleavage stimulation factor 64-kDa subunit and RNA most likely through direct interaction with poly(A) cleavage stimulation factor 64-kDa subunit and cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor 160-kDa subunit. These studies identify a novel group of mammalian polyadenylation regulators. Furthermore, they define a previously unknown nuclear function of Hu proteins.",2007,"Hua Lou, Hua-Lin Zhou, Hui Zhu, Robert A Hasman"
18 wheeler regulates apical constriction of salivary gland cells via the Rho-GTPase-signaling pathway,17512518,10.1016/j.ydbio.2007.04.014,"Rho GTPase and its upstream activator, guanine nucleotide exchange factor 2 (RhoGEF2), have emerged as key regulators of actin rearrangements during epithelial folding and invagination (Nikolaidou, K.K., Barrett, K. (2004). A Rho-GTPase-signaling pathway is used reiteratively in epithelial folding and potentially selects the outcome of Rho activation. Curr. Biol. 14, 1822-1826). Here, we show that Drosophila 18 wheeler (18W), a Toll-like receptor protein, is a novel component of the Rho-signaling pathway involved in epithelial morphogenesis. 18w Mutant embryos have salivary gland invagination defects similar to embryos that lack components of the Rho pathway, and ubiquitous expression of 18W results in an upregulation of Rho signaling. Transheterozygous genetic interactions and double mutant analysis suggest that 18W affects the Rho-GTPase-signaling pathway not through Fog and RhoGEF2, but rather by inhibiting Rho GTPase activating proteins (RhoGAPs). We show that RhoGAP5A and RhoGAP88C/Crossveinless-c (CV-C) are required for proper salivary gland morphogenesis, implicating them as potential targets of 18W.",2007,"Steven K Beckendorf, Tereza Kolesnikov"
Activation of EGFR and ERK by rhomboid signaling regulates the consolidation and maintenance of sleep in Drosophila,17694052,10.1038/nn1957,"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling in the mammalian hypothalamus is important in the circadian regulation of activity. We have examined the role of this pathway in the regulation of sleep in Drosophila melanogaster. Our results demonstrate that rhomboid (Rho)- and Star-mediated activation of EGFR and ERK signaling increases sleep in a dose-dependent manner, and that blockade of rhomboid (rho) expression in the nervous system decreases sleep. The requirement of rho for sleep localized to the pars intercerebralis, a part of the fly brain that is developmentally and functionally analogous to the hypothalamus in vertebrates. These results suggest that sleep and its regulation by EGFR signaling may be ancestral to insects and mammals.",2007,"Ralph J Greenspan, John W Newport, Krisztina Foltenyi"
Mathematical identification of critical reactions in the interlocked feedback model,17971866,10.1371/journal.pone.0001103,"Dynamic simulations are necessary for understanding the mechanism of how biochemical networks generate robust properties to environmental stresses or genetic changes. Sensitivity analysis allows the linking of robustness to network structure. However, it yields only local properties regarding a particular choice of plausible parameter values, because it is hard to know the exact parameter values in vivo. Global and firm results are needed that do not depend on particular parameter values. We propose mathematical analysis for robustness (MAR) that consists of the novel evolutionary search that explores all possible solution vectors of kinetic parameters satisfying the target dynamics and robustness analysis. New criteria, parameter spectrum width and the variability of solution vectors for parameters, are introduced to determine whether the search is exhaustive. In robustness analysis, in addition to single parameter sensitivity analysis, robustness to multiple parameter perturbation is defined. Combining the sensitivity analysis and the robustness analysis to multiple parameter perturbation enables identifying critical reactions. Use of MAR clearly identified the critical reactions responsible for determining the circadian cycle in the Drosophila interlocked circadian clock model. In highly robust models, while the parameter vectors are greatly varied, the critical reactions with a high sensitivity are uniquely determined. Interestingly, not only the per-tim loop but also the dclk-cyc loop strongly affect the period of PER, although the dclk-cyc loop hardly changes its amplitude and it is not potentially influential. In conclusion, MAR is a powerful method to explore wide parameter space without human-biases and to link a robust property to network architectures without knowing the exact parameter values. MAR identifies the reactions critically responsible for determining the period and amplitude in the interlocked feedback model and suggests that the circadian clock intensively evolves or designs the kinetic parameters so that it creates a highly robust cycle.",2007,"Hiroyuki Kurata, Takayuki Tanaka, Fumitaka Ohnishi"

Here we report the efficient visualization of the NBT/BCIP precipitate using confocal reflection microscopy for WMISH samples of Drosophila, zebrafish, and the marine annelid worm, Platynereis dumerilii. In our simple WMISH protocol for reflection CLSM, NBT/BCIP staining can be combined with fluorescent WMISH, immunostainings, or transgenic green fluorescent protein (GFP) marker lines, allowing double labeling of cell types or of embryological structures of interest.

Modulation of insect Ca(v) channels by peptidic spider toxins,17197008,10.1016/j.toxicon.2006.11.012,"Insects have a much smaller repertoire of voltage-gated calcium (Ca(V)) channels than vertebrates. Drosophila melanogaster harbors only a single ortholog of each of the vertebrate Ca(V)1, Ca(V)2, and Ca(V)3 subtypes, although its basal inventory is expanded by alternative splicing and editing of Ca(V) channel transcripts. Nevertheless, there appears to be little functional plasticity within this limited panel of insect Ca(V) channels, since severe loss-of-function mutations in genes encoding the pore-forming alpha1 subunits in Drosophila are embryonic lethal. Since the primary role of spider venom is to paralyze or kill insect prey, it is not surprising that most, if not all, spider venoms contain peptides that potently modify the activity of these functionally critical insect Ca(V) channels. Unfortunately, it has proven difficult to determine the precise ion channel subtypes recognized by these peptide toxins since insect Ca(V) channels have significantly different pharmacology to their vertebrate counterparts, and cloned insect Ca(V) channels are not available for electrophysiological studies. However, biochemical and genetic studies indicate that some of these spider toxins might ultimately become the defining pharmacology for certain subtypes of insect Ca(V) channels. This review focuses on peptidic spider toxins that specifically target insect Ca(V) channels. In addition to providing novel molecular tools for ion channel characterization, some of these toxins are being used as leads to develop new methods for controlling insect pests.",2007,Glenn F King
Simpler mode of inheritance of transcriptional variation in male Drosophila melanogaster,18003923,10.1073/pnas.0705441104,"Sexual selection drives faster evolution in males. The X chromosome is potentially an important target for sexual selection, because hemizygosity in males permits accumulation of alleles, causing tradeoffs in fitness between sexes. Hemizygosity of the X could cause fundamentally different modes of inheritance between the sexes, with more additive variation in males and more nonadditive variation in females. Indeed, we find that genetic variation for the transcriptome is primarily additive in males but nonadditive in females. As expected, these differences are more pronounced on the X chromosome than the autosomes, but autosomal loci are also affected, possibly because of X-linked transcription factors. These differences may be of evolutionary significance because additive variation responds quickly to selection, whereas nonadditive genetic variation does not. Thus, hemizygosity of the X may underlie much of the faster male evolution of the transcriptome and potentially other phenotypes. Consistent with this prediction, genes that are additive in males and nonadditive in females are overrepresented among genes responding to selection for increased mating speed.",2007,"Lauren M McIntyre, Artyom Kopp, Marta L Wayne, Larry Harshman, Marina Telonis-Scott, Lisa M Bono, Sergey V Nuzhdin"
MicroRNAs regulate the expression of the alternative splicing factor nPTB during muscle development,17210790,10.1101/gad.1500707,"Alternative pre-mRNA splicing determines many changes in gene expression during development. Two regulators known to control splicing patterns during neuron and muscle differentiation are the polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) and its neuronal homolog nPTB. These proteins repress certain exons in early myoblasts, but upon differentiation of mature myotubes PTB/nPTB expression is reduced, leading to increased inclusion of their target exons. We show here that the repression of nPTB expression during myoblast differentiation results from its targeting by the muscle-restricted microRNA miR-133. During differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts, nPTB protein but not mRNA expression is strongly reduced, concurrent with the up-regulation of miR-133 and the induction of splicing for several PTB-repressed exons. Introduction of synthetic miR-133 into undifferentiated C2C12 cells leads to a decrease in endogenous nPTB expression. Both the miR-133 and the coexpressed miR-1/206 microRNAs are extremely conserved across animal species, and PTB proteins are predicted targets for these miRNAs in Drosophila, mice, and humans. There are two potential miR-133-responsive elements (MRE) within the nPTB 3' untranslated region (UTR), and a luciferase reporter carrying this 3' UTR is repressed by miR-133 in an MRE-dependent manner. Transfection of locked nucleic acid (LNA) oligonucleotides designed to block the function of miR-133 and miR-1/206 increases expression of nPTB and decreases the inclusion of PTB dependent exons. These results indicate that miR-133 directly down-regulates a key splicing factor during muscle development and establishes a role for microRNAs in the control of a developmentally dynamic splicing program.",2007,"Douglas L Black, Geetanjali Chawla, Peter Stoilov, Paul L Boutz"
"Characterization of Aedes Dredd: a novel initiator caspase from the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti",17517333,10.1016/j.ibmb.2007.03.005,"Caspases play an essential role during programmed cell death in all metazoans.

Although caspases have been characterized in many animals, including Drosophila melanogaster, little is known about the caspases that exist in mosquitoes. Here we describe the identification and characterization of Aedes Dredd (AeDredd), a novel caspase in the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti. AeDredd contains two N-terminal death effector domains and the well conserved caspase catalytic domain. Multiple sequence alignments and functional substrate assays of recombinant protein suggest that AeDredd is an orthologue of Drosophila Dredd and human caspase-8, both central effectors of the death receptor-mediated apoptotic pathway. AeDredd exhibits substrate specificity most similar to human caspase-8. AeDredd transcripts were found in all developmental stages with highest expression in early pupae. Within adults, AeDredd was found in all the tissues examined, with the highest transcript levels detected in fat body tissues. This is the first functional characterization of a death domain-containing caspase in an insect vector of human disease, and will initiate studies on the role of apoptosis in the innate immune response of vectors towards intracellular parasites such as viruses.",2007,"Carl Lowenberger, Frederic Pio, Dave Theilmann, Emily P Thi, Dawn M Cooper"
"A Drosophila gustatory receptor required for the responses to sucrose, glucose, and maltose identified by mRNA tagging",17715294,10.1073/pnas.0702421104,"In Drosophila, detection of tastants is thought to be mediated by members of a family of 68 gustatory receptors (Grs). However, only one receptor, Gr5a, has been associated with a sugar, and it appears to be activated specifically by trehalose. It is unclear whether other sugar receptors are activated by single or multiple sugars. Currently, no Grs are known to colocalize with Gr5a. Such Grs would be candidate sugar receptors because Gr5a-expressing cells function in the responses to attractive tastants. Here we use an ""mRNA tagging"" approach to identify Gr RNAs that are coexpressed with Gr5a. We found that all seven Grs most related to Gr5a (Gr64a-f and Gr61a) were expressed in Gr5a-expressing cells, whereas none of the other Grs examined were enriched in these Gr neurons (GRNs). We characterized the role of one Gr5a-related receptor, Gr64a, and found that it was required for the behavioral responses to glucose, sucrose, and maltose. Gr64a was required for GRN function because action potentials induced by these sugars were dependent on expression of Gr64a in GRNs. These data demonstrate that multiple Grs are coexpressed with Gr5a and that Drosophila Gr64a is required for the responses to multiple sugars.",2007,"Yuchen Jiao, Seok Jun Moon, Craig Montell"

Ae. aegypti heterozygotes of piggyBac reporter-containing transgenes and piggyBac transposase-expressing transgenes showed no evidence of somatic and germ-line remobilization based on phenotypic and molecular detection methods.

A single class of olfactory neurons mediates behavioural responses to a Drosophila sex pheromone,17392786,10.1038/nature05672,"Insects, like many other animals, use sex pheromones to coordinate their reproductive behaviours. Volatile pheromones are detected by odorant receptors expressed in olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs). Whereas fruit odours typically activate multiple ORN classes, pheromones are thought to act through single dedicated classes of ORN. This model predicts that activation of such an ORN class should be sufficient to trigger the appropriate behavioural response. Here we show that the Drosophila melanogaster male-specific pheromone 11-cis-vaccenyl acetate (cVA) acts through the receptor Or67d to regulate both male and female mating behaviour. Mutant males that lack Or67d inappropriately court other males, whereas mutant females are less receptive to courting males. These data suggest that cVA has opposite effects in the two sexes: inhibiting mating behaviour in males but promoting mating behaviour in females. Replacing Or67d with moth pheromone receptors renders these ORNs sensitive to the corresponding moth pheromones. In such flies, moth pheromones elicit behavioural responses that mimic the normal response to cVA. Thus, activation of a single ORN class is both necessary and sufficient to mediate behavioural responses to the Drosophila sex pheromone cVA.",2007,"Alexandre Widmer, Amina Kurtovic, Barry J Dickson"

Hypomorphic mutations of e(r) show an enhancement of a hypomorphic rudimentary mutant wing phenotype. These mutants in a wild-type background are viable, fertile, and morphologically wild-type. Since the only mutant alleles were hypomorphic, it was important to isolate null mutations to determine if any other phenotypes might be associated with a loss-of-function of e(r). We utilized a marked P element, P{SUPor-P, y(+)}, located 895 bp upstream of the start of transcription of e(r) to generate nineteen deficiencies in the region. Deficiencies of e(r) enhance the mutant wing phenotype of a hypomorphic rudimentary allele, r(hd1). In a wild-type background, the deficiencies of e(r), unlike the hypomorphic alleles, have a low viability and females have low fertility. The expression of e(r) in the nurse cells of the ovary is consistent with the low fertility, and suggests an ovarian function for e(r). Deficiencies of CG15352, the gene directly upstream of e(r), are not associated with any obvious mutant phenotypes and present the possibility that it encodes a nonvital or redundant function.",2007,"Margarita Roykhman, Brian Wolff, Nicholas P Rizzo, Stuart I Tsubota, Suzanne Ibach, Melissa Vowels, Deloris Harding, Edward J Wojcik, Mark E Gelsthorpe"

The Drosophila dead end gene is expressed in fusion cells, and encodes an Arf-like3 GTPase. Analyses of dead end RNAi and mutant embryos reveal that the lumen fails to connect between the two branches. Expression of a constitutively active form of Dead end in S2 cells reveals that it influences the state of actin polymerization, and is present on particles that traffic along actin/microtubule-containing processes. Imaging experiments in vivo reveal that Dead end-containing vesicles are associated with recycling endosomes and the exocyst, and control exocyst localization in fusion cells.

Basigin/EMMPRIN/CD147 mediates neuron-glia interactions in the optic lamina of Drosophila,17729283,10.1002/glia.20568,"Basigin, an IgG family glycoprotein found on the surface of human metastatic tumors, stimulates fibroblasts to secrete matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) that remodel the extracellular matrix, and is thus also known as Extracellular Matrix MetalloPRotease Inducer (EMMPRIN). Using Drosophila we previously identified novel roles for basigin. Specifically, photoreceptors of flies with basigin eyes show misplaced nuclei, rough ER and mitochondria, and swollen axon terminals, suggesting cytoskeletal disruptions. Here we demonstrate that basigin is required for normal neuron-glia interactions in the Drosophila visual system. Flies with basigin mutant photoreceptors have misplaced epithelial glial cells within the first optic neuropile, or lamina. In addition, epithelial glia insert finger-like projections--capitate projections (CPs)--sites of vesicle endocytosis and possibly neurotransmitter recycling. When basigin is missing from photoreceptors terminals, CP formation between glia and photoreceptor terminals is disrupted. Visual system function is also altered in flies with basigin mutant eyes. While photoreceptors depolarize normally to light, synaptic transmission is greatly diminished, consistent with a defect in neurotransmitter release.

Clonal analysis, presented here, demonstrated that most of the aberrant phenotypes associated with spoonbill were dependent on a mutant germline. Nevertheless, SPOONBILL may function also in the soma to ensure proper polarization and migration of the border-cell-cluster. Further, genetic interaction studies implicated spoonbill in additional unrelated pathways such as the one(s) involved in actin polymerization/depolymerization.

We isolated mutants lacking Set2, the H3K36me3 methyltransferase, and found that Set2 is an essential gene in both sexes of Drosophila. In set2 mutant males, MSL complex maintains X specificity but exhibits reduced binding to target genes.

An automated feedback system with the hybrid model of scoring and classification for solving over-segmentation problems in RNAi high content screening,17444941,10.1111/j.1365-2818.2007.01762.x,"Background: High content screening (HCS) via automated fluorescence microscopy is a powerful technology for generating cellular images that are rich in phenotypic information. RNA interference is a revolutionary approach for silencing gene expression and has become an important method for studying genes through RNA interference-induced cellular phenotype analysis. The convergence of the two technologies has led to large-scale, image-based studies of cellular phenotypes under systematic perturbations of RNA interference. However, existing high content screening image analysis tools are inadequate to extract content regarding cell morphology from the complex images, thus they limit the potential of genome-wide RNA interference high content screening screening for simple marker readouts. In particular, over-segmentation is one of the persistent problems of cell segmentation; this paper describes a new method to alleviate this problem. Methods: To solve the issue of over-segmentation, we propose a novel feedback system with a hybrid model for automated cell segmentation of images from high content screening. A Hybrid learning model is developed based on three scoring models to capture specific characteristics of over-segmented cells. Dead nuclei are also removed through a statistical model. Results: Experimental validation showed that the proposed method had 93.7% sensitivity and 94.23% specificity. When applied to a set of images of F-actin-stained Drosophila cells, 91.3% of over-segmented cells were detected and only 2.8% were under-segmented. Conclusions: The proposed feedback system significantly reduces over-segmentation of cell bodies caused by over-segmented nuclei, dead nuclei, and dividing cells.

We conclude that the lateral line is uniquely suited among vertebrate sensory systems for a molecular, cellular and genetic analysis of pattern formation and of neural development.",2003,"Fabien Soubiran, Nicolas Gompel, Kelly Decorde, Alain Ghysen, Christine Dambly-Chaudière, Dora Sapède"
A zebrafish homologue of the chemokine receptor Cxcr4 is a germ-cell guidance receptor,12508118,10.1038/nature01338,"Germ cells preserve an individual's genetic information and transmit it to the next generation. Early in development germ cells are set aside and undergo a specialized developmental programme, a hallmark of which is the migration from their site of origin to the future gonad. In Drosophila, several factors have been identified that control germ-cell migration to their target tissues; however, the germ-cell chemoattractant or its receptor have remained unknown. Here we apply genetics and in vivo imaging to show that odysseus, a zebrafish homologue of the G-protein-coupled chemokine receptor Cxcr4, is required specifically in germ cells for their chemotaxis. odysseus mutant germ cells are able to activate the migratory programme, but fail to undergo directed migration towards their target tissue, resulting in randomly dispersed germ cells. SDF-1, the presumptive cognate ligand for Cxcr4, shows a similar loss-of-function phenotype and can recruit germ cells to ectopic sites in the embryo, thus identifying a vertebrate ligand-receptor pair guiding migratory germ cells at all stages of migration towards their target.",2003,"Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard, Robert Geisler, Holger Knaut, Christian Werz, Tübingen 2000 Screen Consortium"
"Neuroglian, Gliotactin, and the Na+/K+ ATPase are essential for septate junction function in Drosophila",12782686,10.1083/jcb.200212054,"One essential function of epithelia is to form a barrier between the apical and basolateral surfaces of the epithelium. In vertebrate epithelia, the tight junction is the primary barrier to paracellular flow across epithelia, whereas in invertebrate epithelia, the septate junction (SJ) provides this function. In this study, we identify new proteins that are required for a functional paracellular barrier in Drosophila. In addition to the previously known components Coracle (COR) and Neurexin (NRX), we show that four other proteins, Gliotactin, Neuroglian (NRG), and both the alpha and beta subunits of the Na+/K+ ATPase, are required for formation of the paracellular barrier. In contrast to previous reports, we demonstrate that the Na pump is not localized basolaterally in epithelial cells, but instead is concentrated at the SJ. Data from immunoprecipitation and somatic mosaic studies suggest that COR, NRX, NRG, and the Na+/K+ ATPase form an interdependent complex. Furthermore, the observation that NRG, a Drosophila homologue of vertebrate neurofascin, is an SJ component is consistent with the notion that the invertebrate SJ is homologous to the vertebrate paranodal SJ. These findings have implications not only for invertebrate epithelia and barrier functions, but also for understanding of neuron-glial interactions in the mammalian nervous system.",2003,"Jennifer L Genova, Richard G Fehon"

Removal of intron sequences from nascent transcripts is mediated by the spliceosome, a large multicomponent complex. We describe here the identification of two genes encoding related, putative splicing factors on human chromosome 19p13.11, SF4 (splicing factor 4) and SFRS14 (splicing factor arginine/serine-rich 14). Both genes encode proteins containing a SURP motif; this domain is found in several splicing proteins including Drosophila alternative splicing regulator, suppressor-of-white-apricot (SWAP) and the yeast splicing factor, prp21p. In addition, SF4 and SFRS14 contain a G-patch domain at their C-termini, a motif present in a large number of eukaryotic RNA-binding proteins. SFRS14 also contains an N-terminal region that is rich in arginine/serine residues, suggesting SFRS14 is a novel member of the SR-related family of pre-mRNA processing factors. We have also identified the mouse orthologues of SF4 and SFRS14, based on conserved domain organization and high sequence similarity. Interestingly, SFRS14 undergoes alternative 3'-end processing events that are conserved between human and mouse, suggesting a functional significance.",2003,"Jane E Hewitt, Natalie D Sampson"
The relationship of neuromuscular synapse elimination to synaptic degeneration and pathology: insights from WldS and other mutant mice,15034273,10.1023/B:NEUR.0000020629.51673.f5,"Neuromuscular synapse elimination, Wallerian degeneration and peripheral neuropathies are not normally considered as related phenomena. However, recent studies of mutant and transgenic mice, particularly the Wld(S) mutant-in which orthograde degeneration is delayed following axotomy-suggest that re-evaluation of possible links between natural, traumatic and pathogenic regression of synapses may be warranted. During developmental synapse elimination from polyneuronally innervated junctions, some motor nerve terminals progressively and asynchronously vacate motor endplates. A form of asynchronous synapse withdrawal, strongly resembling synapse elimination, also occurs from mononeuronally-innervated motor endplates following axotomy in young adult Wld(S) mutant mice. A similar pattern is observed in skeletal muscles of several neuropathic mutants, including mouse models of dying-back neuropathies, motor neuron disease and-remarkably-models of neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington's and Alzheimer's diseases. Taken together with recent analysis of synaptic remodelling at neuromuscular junctions in Drosophila, a strong candidate for a common regulatory mechanism in these diverse conditions is one based on protein ubiquitination/deubiquitination. Axotomised neuromuscular junctions in Wld(S) mutant mice offer favourable experimental opportunities for examining developmental mechanisms of synaptic regression, that may also benefit our understanding of how degeneration in the synaptic compartment of a neuron is initiated, and its role in progressive, whole-cell neuronal degeneration.",2003,"Richard R Ribchester, Thomas H Gillingwater"

We found that Scrib1 synthesis became strongly enhanced in pole cells at the time of gonad formation and was also detectable in cortical domains of gonadal mesodermal cells adjacent to pole cells. Scrib1 synthesis in mesodermal cells was independent of pole cells and occurred in agametic valois and capsuléen embryonic gonads.

Conservation of regulatory elements between two species of Drosophila,14629780,10.1186/1471-2105-4-57,"Background: One of the important goals in the post-genomic era is to determine the regulatory elements within the non-coding DNA of a given organism's genome. The identification of functional cis-regulatory modules has proven difficult since the component factor binding sites are small and the rules governing their arrangement are poorly understood. However, the genomes of suitably diverged species help to predict regulatory elements based on the generally accepted assumption that conserved blocks of genomic sequence are likely to be functional. To judge the efficacy of strategies that prefilter by sequence conservation it is important to know to what extent the converse assumption holds, namely that functional elements common to both species will fall within these conserved blocks. The recently completed sequence of a second Drosophila species provides an opportunity to test this assumption for one of the experimentally best studied regulatory networks in multicellular organisms, the body patterning of the fly embryo. Results: We find that 50%-70% of known binding sites reside in conserved sequence blocks, but these percentages are not greatly enriched over what is expected by chance. Finally, a computational genome-wide search in both species for regulatory modules based on clusters of binding sites suggests that genes central to the regulatory network are consistently recovered. Conclusions: Our results indicate that binding sites remain clustered for these ""core modules"" while not necessarily residing in conserved blocks. This is an important clue as to how regulatory information is encoded in the genome and how modules evolve.",2003,"Eric D Siggia, Nikolaus Rajewsky, Eldon Emberly"
Comparative analysis of leg and antenna development in wild-type and homeotic Drosophila melanogaster,12768424,10.1007/s00427-003-0326-8,"The insect leg and antenna are thought to be homologous structures, evolved from a common ancestral appendage. The homeotic transformations of antenna to leg in Drosophila produced by mutation of the Hox gene Antennapedia are position-specific, such that every particular antenna structure is transformed into a specific leg counterpart. This has been taken to suggest that the developmental programmes of these two appendages are still similar. In particular, the mechanisms for the specification of a cell's position within the appendage would be identical, only their interpretation would be different and subject to homeotic gene control. Here we explore the degree of conservation between the developmental programmes of leg and antenna in Drosophila and other dipterans, in wild-type and homeotic conditions. Most of the appendage pattern-forming genes are active in both appendages, and their expression domains are partially conserved. However, the regulatory relationships and interactions between these genes are different, and in fact cells change their expression while undergoing homeotic transformation. Thus, the positional information, and the mechanisms which generate it, are not strictly conserved between leg and antenna; and homeotic genes alter the establishment of positional clues, not only their interpretation. The partial conservation of pattern-forming genes in both appendages ensures a predictable re-specification of positional clues, producing the observed positional specificity of homeotic transformations.",2003,"Jose I Pueyo, Juan Pablo Couso, Mark Cummins, Steve A Greig"
Variable N-terminal regions of muscle myosin heavy chain modulate ATPase rate and actin sliding velocity,12606545,10.1074/jbc.M212727200,"We integratively assessed the function of alternative versions of a region near the N terminus of Drosophila muscle myosin heavy chain (encoded by exon 3a or 3b). We exchanged the alternative exon 3 regions between an embryonic isoform and the indirect flight muscle isoform. Each chimeric myosin was expressed in Drosophila indirect flight muscle, in the absence of other myosin isoforms, allowing for purified protein analysis and whole organism locomotory studies. The flight muscle isoform generates higher in vitro actin sliding velocity and solution ATPase rates than the embryonic isoform. Exchanging the embryonic exon 3 region into the flight muscle isoform decreased ATPase rates to embryonic levels but did not affect actin sliding velocity or flight muscle ultrastructure. Interestingly, this swap only slightly impaired flight ability. Exchanging the flight muscle-specific exon 3 region into the embryonic isoform increased actin sliding velocity 3-fold and improved indirect flight muscle ultrastructure integrity but failed to rescue the flightless phenotype of flies expressing embryonic myosin. These results suggest that the two structural versions of the exon 3 domain independently influence the kinetics of at least two steps of the actomyosin cross-bridge cycle.",2003,"Aileen F Knowles, William A Kronert, Jennifer A Suggs, Douglas M Swank, Gracielle G Manipon, Sanford I Bernstein, George E Morrill, Massoud Nikkhoy"
"Zebrafish prickle, a modulator of noncanonical Wnt/Fz signaling, regulates gastrulation movements",12699626,10.1016/s0960-9822(03)00240-9,"In addition to the canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway, at least two noncanonical Wnt/Fz pathways have been described: the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway in Drosophila [1] and the Wnt/calcium pathway in vertebrate embryos [2]. Recent work suggests that a vertebrate pathway homologous to the PCP pathway acts to regulate the convergent extension movements of gastrulation [3-7]. To further test this hypothesis, we have identified two zebrafish homologs of the Drosophila PCP gene prickle (pk) [8], both of which show discrete and dynamic expression patterns during gastrulation. Both gain and loss of pk1 function cause defects in convergent extension. Pk1 localizes to both the cytoplasm and the cell membrane, and its normal localization is partially dependent on its C-terminal prenylation motif. At the cell membrane, Pk1 is frequently localized asymmetrically around the cell and can colocalize with the signaling molecule Dishevelled (Dsh). In overexpression assays, Pk1 is able to activate AP-1-mediated transcription and inhibit activation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. Like noncanonical Wnts [9-10], overexpression of Pk1 increases the frequency of calcium transients in zebrafish blastulae. Our results support the idea that a vertebrate PCP pathway regulates gastrulation movements and suggest that there is overlap between the PCP and Wnt/calcium pathways.",2003,"Sarah Hallagan Louie, Randall T Moon, Michael T Veeman, Diane C Slusarski, Ajamete Kaykas"
"Latitudinal clines in Drosophila melanogaster: body size, allozyme frequencies, inversion frequencies, and the insulin-signalling pathway",15133196,10.1007/BF02715819,"Many latitudinal clines exist in Drosophila melanogaster: in adult body size, in allele frequency at allozyme loci, and in frequencies of common cosmopolitan inversions. The question is raised whether these latitudinal clines are causally related. This review aims to connect data from two very different fields of study, evolutionary biology and cell biology, in explaining such natural genetic variation in D. melanogaster body size and development time. It is argued that adult body size clines, inversion frequency clines, and clines in allele frequency at loci involved in glycolysis and glycogen storage are part of the same adaptive strategy. Selection pressure is expected to differ at opposite ends of the clines. At high latitudes, selection on D. melanogaster would favour high larval growth rate at low temperatures, and resource storage in adults to survive winter. At low latitudes selection would favour lower larval critical size to survive crowding, and increased male activity leading to high male reproductive success. Studies of the insulin-signalling pathway in D. melanogaster point to the involvement of this pathway in metabolism and adult body size. The genes involved in the insulin-signalling pathway are associated with common cosmopolitan inversions that show latitudinal clines. Each chromosome region connected with a large common cosmopolitan inversion possesses a gene of the insulin transmembrane complex, a gene of the intermediate pathway and a gene of the TOR branch. The hypothesis is presented that temperate D. melanogaster populations have a higher frequency of a 'thrifty' genotype corresponding to high insulin level or high signal level, while tropical populations possess a more 'spendthrift' genotype corresponding to low insulin or low signal level.",2003,"Zoltán Bochdanovits, Gerdien De Jong"
T-box genes and cardiac development,12768655,10.1002/bdrc.10001,"Background: T-box genes play roles in vertebrate gastrulation and in later organogenesis.

Mammals appear to have at least 18 T-box genes, comprising five subfamilies. Methods: A full range of cytological, developmental, molecular and genetic methodologies have recently been applied to the study of T-box genes. Results: Over the last 5 years, mutations in TBX1 and TBX5 have been implicated in two human disorders with haplo-insufficient cardiovascular phenotypes, DiGeorge/velocardiofacial syndrome and Holt-Oram (""heart-hand"") syndrome. Interestingly, the number of T-box gene family members discovered to have cardiac or pharyngeal arch expression domains during vertebrate embryonic development has steadily grown. In addition, various Tbx5 loss-of-function models in organisms as distant as the mouse and zebrafish do indeed phenocopy Holt-Oram syndrome. Finally, the intriguing discovery earlier this year that a T-box gene is expressed in a subset of cardioblasts in D. melanogaster suggests that members of this gene family may have fundamental, conserved roles in cardiovascular pattern formation.

A fine-scale genetic analysis of hybrid incompatibilities in Drosophila,12663535,,"The sterility and inviability of species hybrids is thought to evolve by the accumulation of genes that cause generally recessive, incompatible epistatic interactions between species. Most analyses of the loci involved in such hybrid incompatibilities have suffered from low genetic resolution. Here I present a fine-resolution genetic screen that allows systematic counting, mapping, and characterizing of a large number of hybrid incompatibility loci in a model genetic system. Using small autosomal deletions from D. melanogaster and a hybrid rescue mutation from D. simulans, I measured the viability of hybrid males that are simultaneously hemizygous for a small region of the D. simulans autosomal genome and hemizygous for the D. melanogaster X chromosome. These hybrid males are exposed to the full effects of any recessive-recessive epistatic incompatibilities present in these regions. A screen of approximately 70% of the D. simulans autosomal genome reveals 20 hybrid-lethal and 20 hybrid-semilethal regions that are incompatible with the D. melanogaster X. In further crosses, I confirm the epistatic nature of hybrid lethality by showing that all of the incompatibilities are rescued when the D. melanogaster X is replaced with a D. simulans X. Combined with information from previous studies, these results show that the number of recessive incompatibilities is approximately eightfold larger than the number of dominant ones. Finally, I estimate that a total of approximately 191 hybrid-lethal incompatibilities separate D. melanogaster and D. simulans, indicating extensive functional divergence between these species' genomes.",2003,Daven C Presgraves
A common sequence motif determines the Cajal body-specific localization of box H/ACA scaRNAs,12912925,10.1093/emboj/cdg394,"Post-transcriptional synthesis of 2'-O-methylated nucleotides and pseudouridines in Sm spliceosomal small nuclear RNAs takes place in the nucleoplasmic Cajal bodies and it is directed by guide RNAs (scaRNAs) that are structurally and functionally indistinguishable from small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) directing rRNA modification in the nucleolus. The scaRNAs are synthesized in the nucleoplasm and specifically targeted to Cajal bodies. Here, mutational analysis of the human U85 box C/D-H/ACA scaRNA, followed by in situ localization, demonstrates that box H/ACA scaRNAs share a common Cajal body-specific localization signal, the CAB box. Two copies of the evolutionarily conserved CAB consensus (UGAG) are located in the terminal loops of the 5' and 3' hairpins of the box H/ACA domains of mammalian, Drosophila and plant scaRNAs. Upon alteration of the CAB boxes, mutant scaRNAs accumulate in the nucleolus. In turn, authentic snoRNAs can be targeted into Cajal bodies by addition of exogenous CAB box motifs. Our results indicate that scaRNAs represent an ancient group of small nuclear RNAs which are localized to Cajal bodies by an evolutionarily conserved mechanism.",2003,"Xavier Darzacq, Patricia Richard, Edouard Bertrand, Beáta E Jády, Tamás Kiss, Céline Verheggen"

Most of the interspecific differences in messenger RNA abundance affect male-biased genes.

CB(1) genes have been identified in mammals, birds, amphibians and fish, whilst CB(2) genes have been identified in mammals and in the puffer fish Fugu rubripes. Therefore, both CB(1) and CB(2) receptors probably occur throughout the vertebrates. However, cannabinoid receptor genes have yet to be identified in any invertebrate species and the evolutionary origin of cannabinoid receptors is unknown. Here we report the identification of CiCBR, a G-protein coupled receptor in a deuterostomian invertebrate - the urochordate Ciona intestinalis - that is orthologous to vertebrate cannabinoid receptors. The CiCBR cDNA encodes a protein with a predicted length (423 amino-acids) that is the intermediate of human CB(1) (472 amino-acids) and human CB(2) (360-amino-acid) receptors. Interestingly, the protein-coding region of the CiCBR gene is interrupted by seven introns, unlike in vertebrate cannabinoid receptor genes where the protein-coding region is typically intronless. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that CiCBR forms a clade with vertebrate cannabinoid receptors but is positioned outside the CB(1) and CB(2) clades of a phylogenetic tree, indicating that the common ancestor of CiCBR and vertebrate cannabinoid receptors predates a gene (genome) duplication event that gave rise to CB(1)- and CB(2)-type receptors in vertebrates.

Several in vivo approaches, including polytene chromosome immunofluorescence, nuclear run-on assays, and, in particular, a protein-DNA cross-linking assay customized for adults, revealed that Cdk7 kinase activity is required for full activation of heat shock genes, promoter-proximal Pol II pausing, and Pol II-dependent chromatin decondensation.

The neural receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase DPTP69D is required during periods of axon outgrowth in Drosophila,12807778,,"We have isolated and characterized a series of 18 chemically induced alleles of Ptp69D ranging in strength from viable to worse than null, which represent unique tools for probing the structure, function, and signaling pathway of DPTP69D. Three alleles are strongly temperature sensitive and were used to define the developmental periods requiring DPTP69D function; adult health requires DPTP69D during the mid- to late-pupal stage, eclosion requires DPTP69D during the early to mid-larval stage, and larval survival requires DPTP69D during embryogenesis. Mutations predicted to abolish the phosphatase activity of the membrane proximal D1 domain severely reduce but do not abolish DPTP69D function. Six alleles appear null; only 20% of null homozygotes pupate and <5% eclose, only to fall into the food and drown. One allele, Ptp69D(7), confers axon and viability defects more severe than those of the null phenotype. Sequence analysis predicts that Ptp69D(7) encodes a mutant protein that may bind but not release substrate. Like mutations in the protein tyrosine phosphatase gene Dlar, strong Ptp69D alleles cause the ISNb nerve to bypass its muscle targets. Genetic analysis reveals that the bypass defect in Dlar and Ptp69D mutants is dependent upon DPTP99A function, consistent with the hypothesis that DPTP69D and DLAR both counteract DPTP99A, allowing ISNb axons to enter their target muscle field.",2003,"Chand Desai, Joy Purdy"

Structure-function analysis of the short splicing variant carboxypeptidase encoded by Drosophila melanogaster silver,20600119,10.1016/j.jmb.2010.06.035,"Drosophila melanogaster silver gene is the ortholog of the coding gene of mammalian carboxypeptidase D (CPD). The silver gene gives rise to eight different splicing variants of differing length that can contain up to three homologous repeats. Among the protein variants encoded, the short form 1B alias DmCPD1Bs (D. melanogaster CPD variant 1B short) is necessary and sufficient for viability of the fruit fly. It has one single repeat, it is active against standard peptide substrates, and it is localized to the secretory pathway. In this work, the enzyme was found as a monomer in solution and as a homodimer in the crystal structure, which features a protomer with an N-terminal 311-residue catalytic domain of alpha/beta-hydrolase fold and a C-terminal 84-residue all-beta transthyretin-like domain. Overall, DmCPD1Bs conforms to the structure of N/E-type funnelins/M14B metallopeptidases, but it has two unique structural elements potentially involved in regulation of its activity: (i) two contiguous surface cysteines that may become palmitoylated and target the enzyme to membranes, thus providing control through localization, and (ii) a surface hot spot targetable by peptidases that would provide a regulatory mechanism through proteolytic inactivation. Given that the fruit fly possesses orthologs of only two out of the five proteolytically competent N/E-type funnelins found in higher vertebrates, DmCPD1Bs may represent a functional analog of at least one of the missing mammalian CPs.",2010,"Sebastián Tanco, F Xavier Gomis-Rüth, Tibisay Guevara, Joan L Arolas, Francesc X Avilés, Julia Lorenzo"
Activation of Snake in a serine protease cascade that defines the dorsoventral axis is atypical and pipe-independent in Drosophila embryos,20638387,10.1016/j.febslet.2010.07.020,"During Drosophila embryogenesis, establishment of ventral and lateral cell fates requires spatial regulation of an extracellular serine protease cascade composed of Nudel, Gastrulation Defective (GD), Snake, and Easter. Pipe, a sulfotransferase expressed ventrally during oogenesis, sulfates secreted targets that somehow confer positive spatial input to this cascade. Nudel and GD activation are pipe-independent, while Easter activation requires pipe. The effect of pipe on Snake activation has been unknown. Here we show that Snake activation is cascade-dependent but pipe-independent. These findings support a conclusion that Snake's activation of Easter is the first spatially regulated step in the dorsoventral protease cascade.",2010,"Benjamin F Cravatt, Pamela W Steen, Sufang Tian, Sarah E Tully, Ellen K LeMosy"

Biodiversity and noncanonical Notch signaling,20816404,10.1016/S0070-2153(10)92014-0,"Early genetics in flies revealed that Notch is a complex pleiotropic locus. We now know that Notch is a receptor that plays prominent roles during development and functions locally in many tissues to instruct cell fate decisions. Drosophila has been an excellent model to identify genetically the elements that contribute to the canonical Notch signaling transduction machinery defined as DSL-Notch-CSL-MAML axis. This core pathway is required in many biological events in all animals. Though the canonical Notch pathway is relatively simple, and as the steps of the events are now more deeply understood, an increasing number of reports in the last decade show that many other molecules can influence Notch signaling, some by competing with a given element of the cascade. This may occur at any step bringing more diversity and plasticity to the Notch pathway. Most of these regulatory molecules act in a context-specific manner and/or are themselves key regulators in other pathways, providing increasing examples of how connections among distinct pathway modulate each other (""cross talk""). The noncanonical signals discussed in this chapter are broadly defined and correspond to the following: DSL-independent activations, interactions with non-DSL ligands, CSL-independent signaling, signal transduction without cleavage, differential posttranslational modifications, competition/protection for a cofactor, and cross talk with other signaling pathways [Wnt, bone morphogenic protein (BMP), NF-kappaB, etc.]. Though some deemed controversial, these events may impact human diseases. Understanding the molecular nature of these events will allow avoidance of adverse effects during possible clinical treatments. In this review, we will focus on some noncanonical Notch activities and their in vivo significance during developmental and pathological processes.",2010,Pascal Heitzler
Hysteresis in the production of force by larval Dipteran muscle,20581278,10.1242/jeb.043026,"We describe neuromuscular hysteresis - the dependence of muscle force on recent motoneuron activity - in the body wall muscles of larval Sarcophaga bullata and Drosophila melanogaster. In semi-intact preparations, isometric force produced by a train of nerve impulses at a constant rate was significantly less than that produced by the same train of stimuli with a brief (200 ms) high-frequency burst of impulses interspersed. Elevated force did not decay back to predicted values after the burst but instead remained high throughout the duration of the stimulus train. The increased force was not due to a change in excitatory junction potentials (EJPs); EJP voltage and time course before and after the high-frequency burst were not statistically different. Single muscle and semi-intact preparations exhibited hysteresis similarly, suggesting that connective tissues of the origin or insertion are not crucial to the mechanism of hysteresis. Hysteresis was greatest at low motoneuron rates - yielding a approximately 100% increase over predicted values based on constant-rate stimulation alone - and decreased as impulse rate increased. We modulated motoneuron frequency rhythmically across rates and cycle periods similar to those observed during kinematic analysis of larval crawling. Positive force hysteresis was also evident within these more physiological activation parameters.",2010,"Ilya Marko Anikin, Jacob L Krans, Bethany A Paterson"
"Role of en and novel interactions between msh, ind, and vnd in dorsoventral patterning of the Drosophila brain and ventral nerve cord",20673828,10.1016/j.ydbio.2010.07.024,"Subdivision of the neuroectoderm into discrete gene expression domains is essential for the correct specification of neural stem cells (neuroblasts) during central nervous system development. Here, we extend our knowledge on dorsoventral (DV) patterning of the Drosophila brain and uncover novel genetic interactions that control expression of the evolutionary conserved homeobox genes ventral nervous system defective (vnd), intermediate neuroblasts defective (ind), and muscle segment homeobox (msh). We show that cross-repression between Ind and Msh stabilizes the border between intermediate and dorsal tritocerebrum and deutocerebrum, and that both transcription factors are competent to inhibit vnd expression. Conversely, Vnd segment-specifically affects ind expression; it represses ind in the tritocerebrum but positively regulates ind in the deutocerebrum by suppressing Msh. These data provide further evidence that in the brain, in contrast to the trunc, the precise boundaries between DV gene expression domains are largely established through mutual inhibition. Moreover, we find that the segment-polarity gene engrailed (en) regulates the expression of vnd, ind, and msh in a segment-specific manner. En represses msh and ind but maintains vnd expression in the deutocerebrum, is required for down-regulation of Msh in the tritocerebrum to allow activation of ind, and is necessary for maintenance of Ind in truncal segments. These results indicate that input from the anteroposterior patterning system is needed for the spatially restricted expression of DV genes in the brain and ventral nerve cord.",2010,"Rolf Urbach, Janina Seibert"
Distinct presynaptic and postsynaptic dismantling processes of Drosophila neuromuscular junctions during metamorphosis,20810883,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0410-10.2010,"Synapse remodeling is a widespread and fundamental process that underlies the formation of neuronal circuitry during development and in adaptation to physiological and/or environmental changes. However, the mechanisms of synapse remodeling are poorly understood. Synapses at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) in Drosophila larvae undergo dramatic and extensive remodeling during metamorphosis to generate adult-specific synapses. To explore the molecular and cellular processes of synapse elimination, we performed confocal microscopy, live imaging, and electron microscopy (EM) of NMJ synapses during the early stages of metamorphosis in Drosophila in which the expressions of selected genes were genetically altered. We report that the localization of the postsynaptic scaffold protein Disc large (Dlg) becomes diffuse first and then undetectable, as larval muscles undergo histolysis, whereas presynaptic vesicles aggregate and are retrogradely transported along axons in synchrony with the formation of filopodia-like structures along NMJ elaborations and retraction of the presynaptic plasma membrane. EM revealed that the postsynaptic subsynaptic reticulum vacuolizes in the early stages of synapse dismantling concomitant with diffuse localization of Dlg. Ecdysone is the major hormone that drives metamorphosis. Blockade of the ecdysone signaling specifically in presynaptic neurons by expression of a dominant-negative form of ecdysone receptors delayed presynaptic but not postsynaptic dismantling. However, inhibition of ecdysone signaling, as well as ubiquitination pathway or apoptosis specifically in postsynaptic muscles, arrested both presynaptic and postsynaptic dismantling. These results demonstrate that presynaptic and postsynaptic dismantling takes place through different mechanisms and that the postsynaptic side plays an instructive role in synapse dismantling.",2010,"Zhiwei Liu, Songyan Wang, Yan Chen, Yong Q Zhang, Dan Wang"

Many molecular tools are available, allowing among other things to reconstruct more accurately the evolutionary history of species and use a comparative approach to infer evolutionary processes. But we can also study evolution in action. Such studies-Experimental Evolution-help us to characterize in detail the evolutionary processes and patterns as a function of environmental challenges, the previous history and present state of populations, and the interactions between such factors. We have now a wide variety of organisms that have been studied with this approach, exploring a diversity of potentialities, in biological characteristics and genetic tools, and covering a variety of evolutionary questions. In this short article I will illustrate the potentialities of Experimental Evolution, focusing in three studies in Drosophila. These and other studies of Experimental Evolution illustrate that Evolution is often local, involving complex patterns and processes, which lead both to specific adaptations and to biological diversity, as Darwin already stated clearly in 'The Origin of Species'.",2010,Margarida Matos

Here, we demonstrate that CtBP forms a complex or complexes with the Drosophila melanogaster Pax6 homolog Eyeless (Ey), and with Distal antenna (Dan), Distal antenna related (Danr), and Dachshund to promote eye and antennal specification. Phenotypic analysis together with molecular data indicate that CtBP interacts with Ey to prevent overproliferation of eye precursors. In contrast, CtBP,dan,danr triple mutant adult eyes have significantly fewer ommatidia than CtBP single or dan,danr double mutants, suggesting that the CtBP/Dan/Danr complex functions to recruit ommatidia from the eye precursor pool. Furthermore, CtBP single and to a greater extent CtBP,dan,danr triple mutants affect the establishment and maintenance of the R8 precursor, which is the founding ommatidial cell. Thus, CtBP interacts with different eye specification factors to regulate gene expression appropriate for proliferative vs. differentiative stages of eye development.",2010,"Chinh Q Hoang, Jennifer Curtiss, Micheal E Burnett"

Here we use crystallography and NMR to elucidate the binding of DDT and glutathione to GSTD1. The crystal structure of Drosophila melanogaster GSTD1 has been determined to 1.1 A resolution, which reveals that the enzyme adopts the canonical GST fold but with a partially occluded active site caused by the packing of a C-terminal helix against one wall of the binding site for substrates. This helix would need to unwind or be displaced to enable catalysis. When the C-terminal helix is removed from the model of the crystal structure, DDT can be computationally docked into the active site in an orientation favoring catalysis. Two-dimensional (1)H,(15)N heteronuclear single-quantum coherence NMR experiments of GSTD1 indicate that conformational changes occur upon glutathione and DDT binding and the residues that broaden upon DDT binding support the predicted binding site. We also show that the ancestral GSTD1 is likely to have possessed DDT dehydrochlorinase activity because both GSTD1 from D. melanogaster and its sibling species, Drosophila simulans, have this activity.",2010,"Charles Robin, Paul R Gooley, Yee-Foong Mok, James Pyke, Hooi Ling Ng, Susanne C Feil, Michael Bieri, Philip Batterham, Wai Yee Low, Malcolm J McConville, Craig J Morton, Michael W Parker, Michael A Gorman"

The CCR4, CAF1 (=POP2), NOT1, NOT2, NOT3, and CAF40 subunits were associated in a stable complex, but NOT4 was not. Factors known to be involved in mRNA regulation were prominent among the other proteins coprecipitated with the CCR4-NOT complex, as analyzed by mass spectrometry. The complex was localized mostly in the cytoplasm but did not appear to be a major component of P bodies. Of the known CCR4 paralogs, Nocturnin was found associated with the subunits of the CCR4-NOT complex, whereas Angel and 3635 were not. RNAi experiments in Schneider cells showed that CAF1, NOT1, NOT2, and NOT3 are required for bulk poly(A) shortening and hsp70 mRNA deadenylation, but knock-down of CCR4, CAF40, and NOT4 did not affect these processes. Overexpression of catalytically dead CAF1 had a dominant-negative effect on mRNA decay. In contrast, overexpression of inactive CCR4 had no effect. We conclude that CAF1 is the major catalytically important subunit of the CCR4-NOT complex in Drosophila Schneider cells. Nocturnin may also be involved in mRNA deadenylation, whereas there is no evidence for a similar role of Angel and 3635.",2010,"Lianbing Zhang, Martine Simonelig, Claudia Temme, Christian Ihling, Elmar Wahle, Elisabeth Kremmer, Andrea Sinz, Aymeric Chartier"

To identify the underlying mechanisms and host factors involved in Rickettsia parkeri actin-based motility, we performed an RNAi screen targeting 115 actin cytoskeletal genes in Drosophila cells. The screen delineated a set of four core proteins-profilin, fimbrin/T-plastin, capping protein, and cofilin--as crucial for determining actin tail length, organizing filament architecture, and enabling motility. In mammalian cells, these proteins were localized throughout R. parkeri tails, consistent with a role in motility.

Two opposing roles of RBP-J in Notch signaling,20816397,10.1016/S0070-2153(10)92007-3,"RBP-J/Su(H)/Lag1, the main transcriptional mediator of Notch signaling, binds DNA with the consensus sequence YRTGDGAD. Notch target genes can be controlled by two opposing activities of RBP-J. The interaction of the Notch intracellular domain with RBP-J induces a weak transcriptional activation and requires an additional tissue-specific transcriptional activator such as bHLH proteins or GATA to mediate strong target gene expression. For example, during Drosophila sensory organ precursor (SOP) cell development, proneural bHLH interacts with Da, a Drosophila orthologue of E2A, to form a tissue-specific activator of Su(H), the Drosophila orthologue of RBP-J. This complex and Su(H) act synergistically to promote the epidermal cell fate. In contrast, a complex of Su(H) with Hairless, a Drosophila functional homologue of MINT, has transcriptional repression activity that promotes SOP differentiation to neurons. Recent conditional loss-of-function studies demonstrated that transcriptional networks involving RBP-J, MINT, and E2A are conserved in mammalian cell differentiation, including multiple steps of lymphocyte development, and probably also in neuronal maturation in adult neurogenesis. During neurogenesis, Notch-RBP-J signaling was thought historically to be involved mainly in the maintenance of undifferentiated neural progenitors. However, the identification of a tissue-specific transcriptional activator of RBP-J-Notch has revealed new roles of RBP-J in the promotion of neuronal maturation. Finally, the Notch-independent function of RBP-J was recently discovered and will be reviewed here.",2010,"Tasuku Honjo, Kenji Tanigaki"

Ten Mst77Y genes encode defective proteins and the other eight are potentially functional. These eight genes produce approximately 20% of the functional Mst77F-like mRNA, and molecular evolutionary analysis shows that they evolved under purifying selection. Hence several Mst77Y genes have all the features of functional genes. Mst77Y genes are present only in D. melanogaster, and phylogenetic analysis confirmed that the duplication is a recent event.

Bombykol receptors in the silkworm moth and the fruit fly,20439725,10.1073/pnas.1003881107,"Male moths are endowed with odorant receptors (ORs) to detect species-specific sex pheromones with remarkable sensitivity and selectivity. We serendipitously discovered that an endogenous OR in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, is highly sensitive to the sex pheromone of the silkworm moth, bombykol. Intriguingly, the fruit fly detectors are more sensitive than the receptors of the silkworm moth, although its ecological significance is unknown. By expression in the ""empty neuron"" system, we identified the fruit fly bombykol-sensitive OR as DmelOR7a (= DmOR7a). The profiles of this receptor in response to bombykol in the native sensilla (ab4) or expressed in the empty neuron system (ab3 sensilla) are indistinguishable. Both WT and transgenic flies responded with high sensitivity, in a dose-dependent manner, and with rapid signal termination. In contrast, the same empty neuron expressing the moth bombykol receptor, BmorOR1, demonstrated low sensitivity and slow signal inactivation. When expressed in the trichoid sensilla T1 of the fruit fly, the neuron housing BmorOR1 responded with sensitivity comparable to that of the native trichoid sensilla in the silkworm moth. By challenging the native bombykol receptor in the fruit fly with high doses of another odorant to which the receptor responds with the highest sensitivity, we demonstrate that slow signal termination is induced by overdose of a stimulus.

Actomyosin contractility and Discs large contribute to junctional conversion in guiding cell alignment within the Drosophila embryonic epithelium,20332153,10.1242/dev.048520,"Proper control of epithelial morphogenesis is vital to development and is often disrupted in disease. After germ band extension, the cells of the Drosophila ventral embryonic epidermis are packed in a two-dimensional polygonal array. Although epithelial cell rearrangements are being studied productively in several tissues, the ventral epidermis is of particular interest as the final cell arrangement is, uniquely, far from equilibrium. We show that over the course of several hours, a subset of cells within each parasegment adopts a rectilinear configuration and aligns into parallel columns. Live imaging shows that this is accomplished by the shrinkage of select cell interfaces, as three-cell junctions are converted to four-cell junctions. Additionally, we show that non-muscle Myosin II and the polarity proteins Discs large (Dlg) and Bazooka are enriched along cell interfaces in a complex but reproducible pattern that suggests their involvement in junctional conversion and cell alignment.

Identification of iron-loaded ferritin as an essential mitogen for cell proliferation and postembryonic development in Drosophila,20628369,10.1038/cr.2010.102,"Animal cells require extrinsic cues for growth, proliferation and survival. The propagation of Drosophila imaginal disc cells in vitro, for example, requires the supplementation of fly extract, the composition of which remains largely undefined. Here I report the biochemical purification of iron-loaded ferritin as an active ingredient of fly extract that is required for promoting the growth of clone 8 imaginal disc cells. Consistent with an essential role for iron-loaded ferritin in cultured cells, overexpression of ferritin or addition of iron in a nutrient-poor diet increases animal viability and body weight, promotes cell proliferation, and shortens the duration of postembryonic development. Conversely, overexpression of dominant-negative ferritin or addition of iron chelator causes the opposite effects. Ferritin mutant flies arrest development at the first-instar larval stage with a severe starvation phenotype reminiscent of that seen in starved larvae. I conclude that iron-loaded ferritin acts as an essential mitogen for cell proliferation and postembryonic development in Drosophila by maintaining iron homeostasis and antagonizing starvation response.",2010,Sheng Li
A simple multiallele model and its application to identifying preferred-unpreferred codons using polymorphism data,20106905,10.1093/molbev/msq023,"Analysis of within-species polymorphism data usually relies on population genetic models that assume two alleles at a locus (e.g., the infinite sites model). However, many problems of interest can be tackled more naturally by multiallele models. In this study, I construct a model that can accommodate an arbitrary number of alleles at a locus, mutational biases, and selective differences between each of the alleles. It is constructed by representing population dynamics by a Markov transition matrix and is based on the assumption that at most two variants exist at each polymorphic site. A likelihood-based method for inferring the selection and mutational parameters of the model is constructed and is shown to have high accuracy. I use this method to jointly infer preferred codons and mutational parameters in Drosophila melanogaster. Twenty-one codons are identified as preferred, 19 of which were found previously by methods that do not use polymorphism data. Interestingly, the selective difference between the fittest and the worst codons encoding the same amino acid is positively correlated with the number of synonymous codons for that amino acid, in agreement with previous analyses of interspecies data using phylogenetic models. The inferred mutation matrix is highly asymmetric, with C-->T and G-->A being the most common and constituting approximately 18% and approximately 19% of all mutation events, respectively. These results suggest that the new model provides a useful framework for analyzing polymorphism data sampled from multiallele systems.",2010,Kai Zeng
A distinct set of Drosophila brain neurons required for neurofibromatosis type 1-dependent learning and memory,20668197,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0283-10.2010,"Nonspecific cognitive impairments are one of the many manifestations of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). A learning phenotype is also present in Drosophila melanogaster that lack a functional neurofibromin gene (nf1). Multiple studies have indicated that Nf1-dependent learning in Drosophila involves the cAMP pathway, including the demonstration of a genetic interaction between Nf1 and the rutabaga-encoded adenylyl cyclase (Rut-AC). Olfactory classical conditioning experiments have previously demonstrated a requirement for Rut-AC activity and downstream cAMP pathway signaling in neurons of the mushroom bodies. However, Nf1 expression in adult mushroom body neurons has not been observed. Here, we address this discrepancy by demonstrating (1) that Rut-AC is required for the acquisition and stability of olfactory memories, whereas Nf1 is only required for acquisition, (2) that expression of nf1 RNA can be detected in the cell bodies of mushroom body neurons, and (3) that expression of an nf1 transgene only in the alpha/beta subset of mushroom body neurons is sufficient to restore both protein synthesis-independent and protein synthesis-dependent memory. Our observations indicate that memory-related functions of Rut-AC are both Nf1-dependent and -independent, that Nf1 mediates the formation of two distinct memory components within a single neuron population, and that our understanding of Nf1 function in memory processes may be dissected from its role in other brain functions by specifically studying the alpha/beta mushroom body neurons.",2010,"Monica E Buchanan, Ronald L Davis"

Beetle immunity,21528698,10.1007/978-1-4419-8059-5_9,"Genetic studies have elegantly characterized the innate immune response in Drosophila melanogaster. However, these studies have a limited ability to reveal the biochemical mechanisms underlying the innate immune response. To investigate the biochemical basis of how insects recognize invading microbes and how these recognition signals activate the innate immune response, it is necessary to use insects, from which larger amounts of hemolymph can be extracted. Using the larvae from two species of beetle, Tenebrio molitor and Holotrichia diomphalia, we elucidated the mechanisms underlying pathogenic microbe recognition. In addition, we studied the mechanism of host defense molecule amplification. In particular, we identified several pattern recognition proteins, serine proteases, serpins and antimicrobial peptides and examined how these molecules affect innate immunity.",2010,"Kenneth Söderhill, Jiang Rui, Jun-Ho Chai, Kenji Kurokawa, Nam-Chul Ha, Bok Luel Lee, Keun-Hwa Park, Irene Söderhill, Ji-Won Park, Hyun-Ok Hwang, Chan-Hee Kim, Kyung-Hwa Ryu"
Spatially defined Dsh-Lgl interaction contributes to directional tissue morphogenesis,20736316,10.1242/jcs.069898,"The process of epithelial morphogenesis defines the structure of epidermal tissue sheets. One such sheet, the ventral epidermis of the Drosophila embryo, shows both intricate segmental patterning and complex cell organization. Within a segment, cells produce hair-like denticles in a stereotypical and highly organized pattern over the surface of the tissue. To understand the cell biological basis of this process, we examined cell shapes and alignments, and looked for molecules that showed an asymmetric distribution in this tissue. We found that apical polarity determinants and adherens junctions were enriched at the dorsal and ventral borders of cells, whereas basolateral determinants were enriched at the anterior and posterior borders. We report that the basolateral determinant Lgl has a novel function in the planar organization of the embryonic epidermis, and this function depends on Dsh and myosin. We conclude that apical-basal proteins, used to establish polarity within a cell, can be independently co-opted to function in epithelial morphogenesis.",2010,"Nicholas S Tolwinski, Nicole A Kaplan"
Genetic analysis of sleep,20551171,10.1101/gad.1913110,"Almost 20 years ago, the gene underlying fatal familial insomnia was discovered, and first suggested the concept that a single gene can regulate sleep. In the two decades since, there have been many advances in the field of behavioral genetics, but it is only in the past 10 years that the genetic analysis of sleep has emerged as an important discipline. Major findings include the discovery of a single gene underlying the sleep disorder narcolepsy, and identification of loci that make quantitative contributions to sleep characteristics. The sleep field has also expanded its focus from mammalian model organisms to Drosophila, zebrafish, and worms, which is allowing the application of novel genetic approaches. Researchers have undertaken large-scale screens to identify new genes that regulate sleep, and are also probing questions of sleep circuitry and sleep function on a molecular level. As genetic tools continue to be refined in each model organism, the genes that support a specific function in sleep will become more apparent. Thus, while our understanding of sleep still remains rudimentary, rapid progress is expected from these recently initiated studies.",2010,"Amita Sehgal, Amanda Crocker"
Reinforcement of gametic isolation in Drosophila,20351771,10.1371/journal.pbio.1000341,"Reinforcement, a process by which natural selection increases reproductive isolation between populations, has been suggested to be an important force in the formation of new species. However, all existing cases of reinforcement involve an increase in mate discrimination between species. Here, I report the first case of reinforcement of postmating prezygotic isolation (i.e., barriers that act after mating but before fertilization) in animals. On the slopes of the African island of São Tomé, Drosophila yakuba and its endemic sister species D. santomea hybridize within a well-demarcated hybrid zone. I find that D. yakuba females from within this zone, but not from outside it, show an increase in gametic isolation from males of D. santomea, an apparent result of natural selection acting to reduce maladaptive hybridization between species. To determine whether such a barrier could evolve under laboratory conditions, I exposed D. yakuba lines derived from allopatric populations to experimental sympatry with D. santomea, and found that both behavioral and gametic isolation become stronger after only four generations. Reinforcement thus appears to be the best explanation for the heightened gametic isolation seen in sympatry. This appears to be the first example in animals in which natural selection has promoted the evolution of stronger interspecific genetic barriers that act after mating but before fertilization. This suggests that many other genetic barriers between species have been increased by natural selection but have been overlooked because they are difficult to study.",2010,Daniel R Matute
Nonparametric identification of regulatory interactions from spatial and temporal gene expression data,20684787,10.1186/1471-2105-11-413,"Background: The correlation between the expression levels of transcription factors and their target genes can be used to infer interactions within animal regulatory networks, but current methods are limited in their ability to make correct predictions. Results: Here we describe a novel approach which uses nonparametric statistics to generate ordinary differential equation (ODE) models from expression data. Compared to other dynamical methods, our approach requires minimal information about the mathematical structure of the ODE; it does not use qualitative descriptions of interactions within the network; and it employs new statistics to protect against over-fitting. It generates spatio-temporal maps of factor activity, highlighting the times and spatial locations at which different regulators might affect target gene expression levels. We identify an ODE model for eve mRNA pattern formation in the Drosophila melanogaster blastoderm and show that this reproduces the experimental patterns well. Compared to a non-dynamic, spatial-correlation model, our ODE gives 59% better agreement to the experimentally measured pattern. Our model suggests that protein factors frequently have the potential to behave as both an activator and inhibitor for the same cis-regulatory module depending on the factors' concentration, and implies different modes of activation and repression. Conclusions: Our method provides an objective quantification of the regulatory potential of transcription factors in a network, is suitable for both low- and moderate-dimensional gene expression datasets, and includes improvements over existing dynamic and static models.",2010,"Claire J Tomlin, Anil Aswani, Soile V E Keränen, Peter Bickel, Mark D Biggin, Charless C Fowlkes, David W Knowles, James Brown"
Mathematical modelling and experiments for the proliferation and differentiation of Drosophila intestinal stem cells I,22873361,10.1080/17513750903045635,"We study the proliferation and differentiation of stem cells in the Drosophila posterior midgut epithelium, which mainly consists of intestinal stem cells (ISCs); semi-differentiated cells, i.e. enteroblasts (EBs); and two types of fully differentiated cells, i.e. enteroendocrine cells (EEs) and enterocytes (ECs). The cellular system of ISCs is controlled by Wnt and Notch signalling pathways. In this article, we experimentally show that EBs are not capable of efficiently differentiating into ECs in the absence of Wnt signalling. On the basis of the experimental results and known facts, we propose a scheme and a simple ordinary differential equation (ODE) model for the proliferation and differentiation of ISCs.

"A manual collection of Syt, Esyt, Rph3a, Rph3al, Doc2, and Dblc2 genes from 46 metazoan genomes--an open access resource for neuroscience and evolutionary biology",20078875,10.1186/1471-2164-11-37,"Background: Synaptotagmin proteins were first identified in nervous tissue, residing in synaptic vesicles. Synaptotagmins were subsequently found to form a large family, some members of which play important roles in calcium triggered exocytic events. These members have been investigated intensively, but other family members are not well understood, making it difficult to grasp the meaning of family membership in functional terms. Further difficulty arises as families are defined quite legitimately in different ways: by common descent or by common possession of distinguishing features. One definition does not necessarily imply the other. The evolutionary range of genome sequences now available, can shed more light on synaptotagmin gene phylogeny and clarify family relationships. The aim of compiling this open access collection of synaptotagmin and synaptotagmin-like sequences, is that its use may lead to greater understanding of the biological function of these proteins in an evolutionary context. Results: 46 metazoan genomes were examined and their complement of Syt, Esyt, Rph3a, Rph3al, Doc2 and Dblc2 genes identified. All of the sequences were compared, named, then examined in detail. Esyt genes were formerly named Fam62. The species in this collection are Trichoplax, Nematostella, Capitella, Helobdella, Lottia, Ciona, Strongylocentrotus, Branchiostoma, Ixodes, Daphnia, Acyrthosiphon, Tribolium, Nasonia, Apis, Anopheles, Drosophila, Caenorhabditis, Takifugu, Tetraodon, Gasterosteus, Oryzias, Danio, Xenopus, Anolis, Gallus, Taeniopygia,Ornithorhynchus, Monodelphis, Mus and Homo. All of the data described in this paper is available as additional files. Conclusions: Only a subset of synaptotagmin proteins appear able to function as calcium triggers. Syt1, Syt7 and Syt9 are ancient conserved synaptotagmins of this type. Some animals carry extensive repertoires of synaptotagmin genes. Other animals of no less complexity, carry only a small repertoire. Current understanding does not explain why this is so. The biological roles of many synaptotagmins remain to be understood. This collection of genes offers prospects for fruitful speculation about the functional roles of the synaptotagmin repertoires of different animals and includes a great range of biological complexity. With reference to this gene collection, functional relationships among Syt, Esyt, Rph3a, Rph3al, Doc2 and Dblc2 genes, which encode similar proteins, can better be assessed in future.",2010,Molly Craxton
Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 4 is a dynamic tight junction-related shuttle protein involved in epithelium homeostasis,18953416,10.1371/journal.pone.0003518,"Background: Despite numerous in vivo evidences that Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor-Associated Factor 4 (TRAF4) plays a key biological function, how it works at the cellular and molecular level remains elusive. Methodology/principal findings: In the present study, we show using immunofluorescence and immuohistochemistry that TRAF4 is a novel player at the tight junctions (TJs). TRAF4 is connected to assembled TJs in confluent epithelial cells, but accumulates in the cytoplasm and/or nucleus when TJs are open in isolated cells or EGTA-treated confluent cells. In vivo, TRAF4 is consistently found at TJs in normal human mammary epithelia as well as in well-differentiated in situ carcinomas. In contrast, TRAF4 is never localized at the plasma membrane of poorly-differentiated invasive carcinomas devoid of correct TJs, but is observed in the cytoplasm and/or nucleus of the cancer cells. Moreover, TRAF4 TJ subcellular localization is remarkably dynamic. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments show that TRAF4 is highly mobile and shuttles between TJs and the cytoplasm. Finally, we show that intracellular TRAF4 potentiates ERK1/2 phosphorylation in proliferating HeLa cells, an epithelial cell line known to be devoid of TJs. Conclusions/significance: Collectively, our data strongly support the new concept of TJs as a dynamic structure. Moreover, our results implicate TRAF4 in one of the emerging TJ-dependent signaling pathways that responds to cell polarity by regulating the cell proliferation/differentiation balance, and subsequently epithelium homeostasis. Drastic phenotypes or lethality in TRAF4-deficient mice and drosophila strongly argue in favor of such a function.",2008,"Fabien Alpy, Catherine Tomasetto, Marie-Christine Rio, Valérie Kédinger, Aurélie Baguet, Isabelle Stoll, Marie-Pierre Chenard, Myriam Polette"
Bayesian inference of population size history from multiple loci,18947398,10.1186/1471-2148-8-289,"Background: Effective population size (Ne) is related to genetic variability and is a basic parameter in many models of population genetics. A number of methods for inferring current and past population sizes from genetic data have been developed since JFC Kingman introduced the n-coalescent in 1982. Here we present the Extended Bayesian Skyline Plot, a non-parametric Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm that extends a previous coalescent-based method in several ways, including the ability to analyze multiple loci. Results: Through extensive simulations we show the accuracy and limitations of inferring population size as a function of the amount of data, including recovering information about evolutionary bottlenecks. We also analyzed two real data sets to demonstrate the behavior of the new method; a single gene Hepatitis C virus data set sampled from Egypt and a 10 locus Drosophila ananassae data set representing 16 different populations. Conclusion: The results demonstrate the essential role of multiple loci in recovering population size dynamics. Multi-locus data from a small number of individuals can precisely recover past bottlenecks in population size which can not be characterized by analysis of a single locus. We also demonstrate that sequence data quality is important because even moderate levels of sequencing errors result in a considerable decrease in estimation accuracy for realistic levels of population genetic variability.",2008,"Joseph Heled, Alexei J Drummond"

We found that ZM39923, a Janus kinase inhibitor, and its metabolite ZM449829 were the most potent inhibitors with IC(50) of 10 and 5 nM, respectively. In addition, two other inhibitors, including tyrphostin 47 and vitamin K(3), were found to have an IC(50) in the micromolar range. These agents used in part a thiol-dependent mechanism to inhibit TGM2, consistent with the activation of TGM2 by reduction of an intramolecular disulfide bond. These inhibitors were tested in a polyglutamine-expressing Drosophila model of neurodegeneration and found to improve survival. The TGM2 inhibitors we discovered may serve as valuable lead compounds for the development of orally active TGM2 inhibitors to treat human diseases.",2008,"David C Sane, Warren J Strittmatter, Tim Tucker, Charles S Greenberg, Kurt R Daniel, Eric Toone, James R Burke, Yusha Liu, Thung-S Lai"

Mutation of Trp83 to Ala or Glu widens the channel from 5 A to 9 A. The kinetics of substrate hydrolysis and the effect of ligands that close the main entrance suggest that the mutations facilitate both product exit and substrate entrance. Thus, in the wild-type, the channel is so narrow that the 'back door' is used by at most 5% of the traffic, with the majority of traffic passing through the main entrance. In mutants Trp83Ala and Trp83Glu, ligands that close the main entrance do not inhibit substrate hydrolysis because the traffic can pass via an alternative route, presumably the enlarged back channel.",2008,"Jure Stojan, Didier Fournier, Florian Nachon"
"Swiss Cheese, a protein involved in progressive neurodegeneration, acts as a noncanonical regulatory subunit for PKA-C3",18945896,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3015-08.2008,"The Drosophila Swiss Cheese (SWS) protein and its vertebrate ortholog Neuropathy Target Esterase (NTE) are required for neuronal survival and glial integrity. In humans, NTE is the target of organophosphorous compounds which cause a paralyzing axonal degeneration and recently mutations in NTE have been shown to cause a Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia called NTE-related Motor-Neuron Disorder. SWS and NTE are concentrated in the endoplasmic reticulum and both have been shown to have an esterase function against an artificial substrate. However, the functional mechanisms and the pathways in which SWS/NTE are involved in are still widely unknown. Here, we show that SWS interacts specifically with the C3 catalytic subunit of cAMP activated protein kinase (PKA-C3), which together with orthologs in mouse (Pkare) and human (PrKX) forms a novel class of catalytic subunits of unknown function. This interaction requires a domain of SWS which shows homology to regulatory subunits of PKA and, like conventional regulatory subunits, the binding of SWS to the PKA-C3 inhibits its function. Consistent with this result, expression of additional PKA-C3 induces degeneration and enhances the neurodegenerative phenotype in sws mutants. We also show that the complex formation with the membrane-bound SWS tethers PKA-C3 to membranes. We therefore propose a model in which SWS acts as a noncanonical subunit for PKA-C3, whereby the complex formation regulates the localization and kinase activity of PKA-C3, and that disruption of this regulation can induce neurodegeneration.",2008,"Doris Kretzschmar, Jill Wentzell, Alexandre Bettencourt da Cruz"
Drosophila Lin-7 is a component of the Crumbs complex in epithelia and photoreceptor cells and prevents light-induced retinal degeneration,18177979,10.1016/j.ejcb.2007.11.002,"The Drosophila Crumbs protein complex is required to maintain epithelial cell polarity in the embryo, to ensure proper morphogenesis of photoreceptor cells and to prevent light-dependent retinal degeneration. In Drosophila, the core components of the complex are the transmembrane protein Crumbs, the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) Stardust and the scaffolding protein DPATJ. The composition of the complex and some of its functions are conserved in mammalian epithelial and photoreceptor cells. Here, we report that Drosophila Lin-7, a scaffolding protein with one Lin-2/Lin-7 (L27) domain and one PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1 (PDZ) domain, is associated with the Crumbs complex in the subapical region of embryonic and follicle epithelia and at the stalk membrane of adult photoreceptor cells. DLin-7 loss-of-function mutants are viable and fertile. While DLin-7 localization depends on Crumbs, neither Crumbs, Stardust nor DPATJ require DLin-7 for proper accumulation in the subapical region. Unlike other components of the Crumbs complex, DLin-7 is also enriched in the first optic ganglion, the lamina, where it co-localizes with Discs large, another member of the MAGUK family. In contrast to crumbs mutant photoreceptor cells, those mutant for DLin-7 do not display any morphogenetic abnormalities. Similar to crumbs mutant eyes, however, DLin-7 mutant photoreceptors undergo progressive, light-dependent degeneration. These results support the previous conclusions that the function of the Crumbs complex in cell survival is independent from its function in photoreceptor morphogenesis.",2008,"André Bachmann, Kevin Johnson, Elisabeth Knust, Ferdi Grawe"
Comparative and phylogenomic studies on the mitochondrial genomes of Pentatomomorpha (Insecta: Hemiptera: Heteroptera),19091056,10.1186/1471-2164-9-610,"Background: Nucleotide sequences and the gene arrangements of mitochondrial genomes are effective tools for resolving phylogenetic problems. Hemipteroid insects are known to possess highly reorganized mitochondrial genomes, but in the suborder Heteroptera (Insecta: Hemiptera), there was only one complete mitochondrial genome sequenced without gene rearrangement and the phylogeny of infraorder Pentatomomorpha in Heteroptera was still uncertain. Results: Fifteen mitochondrial genomes of the suborder Heteroptera were sequenced. Gene rearrangements were found as follows: 1) tRNA-I and tRNA-Q switched positions in Aradidae, 2) tRNA-T and tRNA-P switched positions in Largidae and Pyrrhocoridae. Two recombination events were found in Alydidae and Malcidae. The other mt-genomes were organized in the same way as observed in Drosophila yakuba. The phylogenetic analyses of infraorder Pentatomomorpha based on the nucleotide sequence raised the hypothesis of (Aradoidea + (Pentatomoidea + (Pyrrhocoroidea + (Lygaeoidea + Coreoidea)))). The rearrangement of tRNA-T and tRNA-P also linked Largidae and Pyrrhocoridae together. Furthermore, the conserved sequence block in the unusual intergenic spacers between tRNA-H and ND4 favored the monophyly of Lygaeoidea. Tetranucleotide ATCA was inferred to be the initiation codon of ND2 in Cydnidae. No correlation was found between the rates of nucleotide substitution and gene rearrangement. CG content was significantly correlated with the nucleotide substitution rate of each gene. For ND1, there was a positive correlation (P < 0.01) between amino acids variations and hydrophobicity, but a negative correlation (P < 0.01) for ND6. No conserved sequence was found among the control regions and these regions were not always the most AT-rich region of the mt-genome. Conclusion: Heteropteran insects are extremely complex groups worthy of further study because of the unusual tetranucleotide initiation codon and their great mt-genomic diversity, including gene rearrangements and recombinations. The mt-genome is a powerful molecular marker for resolving phylogeny at the level of the superfamily and family. Gene rearrangements were not correlated with nucleotide substitution rates. CG content variation caused the different evolutionary patterns among genes. For ND1, in many polar or nonpolar regions the specific identity of the amino acid residues might be more important than maintaining the polarity of these regions, while the opposite is true for ND6. Most sequences of the control regions did not appear to be important for regulatory functions. Finally, we suggest that the term ""AT-rich regions"" should not be used.",2008,"Wenjun Bu, Jimeng Hua, Pengzhi Dong, Qiang Xie, Ming Li, Ying Cui"
Temporal reciprocity of miRNAs and their targets during the maternal-to-zygotic transition in Drosophila,18394895,10.1016/j.cub.2008.02.081,"During oogenesis, female animals load their eggs with messenger RNAs (mRNAs) that will be translated to produce new proteins in the developing embryo. Some of these maternally provided mRNAs are stable and continue to contribute to development long after the onset of transcription of the embryonic (zygotic) genome. However, a subset of maternal mRNAs are degraded during the transition from purely maternal to mixed maternal-zygotic gene expression. In Drosophila, two independent RNA degradation pathways are used to promote turnover of maternal transcripts during the maternal-to-zygotic transition [1]. The first is driven by maternally encoded factors, including SMAUG [2], whereas the second is activated about 2 hr after fertilization, coinciding with the onset of zygotic transcription. Here, we report that a cluster of zygotically expressed microRNAs (miRNAs) targets maternal mRNAs for turnover, as part of the zygotic degradation pathway. miRNAs are small noncoding RNAs that silence gene expression by repressing translation of their target mRNAs and by promoting mRNA turnover. Intriguingly, use of miRNAs to promote mRNA turnover during the maternal-to-zygotic transition appears to be a conserved phenomenon because a comparable role was reported for miR-430 in zebrafish [3]. The finding that unrelated miRNAs regulate the maternal to zygotic transition in different animals suggests convergent evolution.",2008,"Alexander Stark, Stephen M Cohen, Julius Brennecke, Natascha Bushati"

Here, we have examined a role of Vps35, an essential retromer subunit, in Wnt signaling in Drosophila and mammalian cells. We provide compelling evidence that the retromer complex is required for Wnt secretion. Importantly, Vps35 colocalizes in endosomes and interacts with Wls. Wls becomes unstable in the absence of retromer activity. Our findings link Wls and retromer functions in the same conserved Wnt secretion pathway.

The engineered yeast was able to produce a MUC1a peptide containing O-glycan and also a mucin-like glycoprotein, human podoplanin (hPod; also known as aggrus), which is a platelet-aggregating factor that requires a sialyl-core1 structure for activity. After in vitro sialylation, hPod from yeast could induce platelet aggregation. Interestingly, substitution of ppGalNAc-T1 for ppGalNAc-T3 caused a loss of platelet aggregation-inducing activity, despite the fact that the sialyl-core1 was detectable in both hPod proteins on a lectin microarray. Most of O-mannosylation, a common modification in yeast, to MUC1a was suppressed by the addition of a rhodanine-3-acetic acid derivative in the culture medium.

Association of cohesin and Nipped-B with transcriptionally active regions of the Drosophila melanogaster genome,17965872,10.1007/s00412-007-0129-1,"The cohesin complex is a chromosomal component required for sister chromatid cohesion that is conserved from yeast to man. The similarly conserved Nipped-B protein is needed for cohesin to bind to chromosomes. In higher organisms, Nipped-B and cohesin regulate gene expression and development by unknown mechanisms. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we find that Nipped-B and cohesin bind to the same sites throughout the entire non-repetitive Drosophila genome. They preferentially bind transcribed regions and overlap with RNA polymerase II. This contrasts sharply with yeast, where cohesin binds almost exclusively between genes. Differences in cohesin and Nipped-B binding between Drosophila cell lines often correlate with differences in gene expression. For example, cohesin and Nipped-B bind the Abd-B homeobox gene in cells in which it is transcribed, but not in cells in which it is silenced. They bind to the Abd-B transcription unit and downstream regulatory region and thus could regulate both transcriptional elongation and activation. We posit that transcription facilitates cohesin binding, perhaps by unfolding chromatin, and that Nipped-B then regulates gene expression by controlling cohesin dynamics. These mechanisms are likely involved in the etiology of Cornelia de Lange syndrome, in which mutation of one copy of the NIPBL gene encoding the human Nipped-B ortholog causes diverse structural and mental birth defects.",2008,"Xiao-Yong Li, Yuri B Schwartz, Vincenzo Pirrotta, Stewart MacArthur, Ziva Misulovin, Dale Dorsett, Tatyana G Kahn, Michael B Eisen, Justin C Fay, Mark D Biggin, Maria Gause"

Among this subfamily, TRPM8 (also known as Trp-p8) is a Ca(2+)-permeable channel that was originally identified as a prostate-specific gene upregulated in tumors. Here we showed that the TRPM8 channel was expressed in human melanoma G-361 cells, and activation of the channel produced sustainable Ca(2+) influx. The application of menthol, an agonist for TRPM8 channel, elevated cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration in a concentration-dependent manner with an EC(50) value of 286 microM in melanoma cells. Menthol-induced responses were significantly abolished by the removal of external Ca(2+). Moreover, inward currents at a holding potential of -60 mV in melanoma cells were markedly potentiated by the addition of 300 microM menthol. The most striking finding was that the viability of melanoma cells was dose-dependently depressed in the presence of menthol. These results reveal that a functional TRPM8 protein is expressed in human melanoma cells to involve the mechanism underlying tumor progression via the Ca(2+) handling pathway, providing us with a novel target of drug development for malignant melanoma.",2008,"Hisao Yamamura, Shinya Ugawa, Akimichi Morita, Takashi Ueda, Shoichi Shimada"

The phylogenetic tree based on deduced amino acid sequences of invertebrate TNF-like protein and vertebrate TNFs supported the divergence between the ascidian and vertebrate TNF families, whereas D. melanogaster Eiger A and B TNF-like sequences were distinctly separated from the chordate TNFs. Thus, the ascidian TNFalpha-like cytokine was upregulated by in vivo LPS challenge supporting its pro-inflammatory role. In the pharynx, increased expression levels were found following analysis by real-time polymerase chain reaction, whereas in situ hybridization assay showed positive hemocytes both in the tissue and in circulating hemocytes. Finally, Western blot with monoclonal antibodies disclosed human TNFalpha epitopes in a 15-kDa protein component of the hemolymph serum and in a 43-kDa protein contained in the hemocyte lysate supernatant prepared in the presence of detergents. Both soluble and hemocyte-bound CiTNF alpha-like protein therefore appeared to be modulated by the LPS challenge.",2008,"Giuseppina Salerno, Aiti Vizzini, Nicolò Parrinello, Matteo Cammarata, Daniela Parrinello, Francesca Tiziana Giaramita, Mirella Vazzana, Vincenzo Arizza"
Evolutionary origin and genomic organisation of runt-domain containing genes in arthropods,19032778,10.1186/1471-2164-9-558,"Background: Gene clusters, such as the Hox gene cluster, are known to have critical roles in development. In eukaryotes gene clusters arise primarily by tandem gene duplication and divergence. Genes within a cluster are often co-regulated, providing selective pressure to maintain the genome organisation, and this co-regulation can result in temporal or spatial co-linearity of gene expression. It has been previously noted that in Drosophila melanogaster, three of the four runt-domain (RD) containing genes are found in a relatively tight cluster on chromosome 1, raising the possibility of a putative functional RD gene cluster in D. melanogaster. Results: To investigate the possibility of such a gene cluster, orthologues of the Drosophila melanogaster RD genes were identified in several endopterygotan insects, two exopterygotan insects and two non-insect arthropods. In all insect species four RD genes were identified and orthology was assigned to the Drosophila sequences by phylogenetic analyses. Although four RD genes were found in the crustacean D. pulex, orthology could not be assigned to the insect sequences, indicating independent gene duplications from a single ancestor following the split of the hexapod lineage from the crustacean lineage.In insects, two chromosomal arrangements of these genes was observed; the first a semi-dispersed cluster, such as in Drosophila, where lozenge is separated from the core cluster of three RD genes often by megabases of DNA. The second arrangement was a tight cluster of the four RD genes, such as in Apis mellifera.This genomic organisation, particularly of the three core RD genes, raises the possibility of shared regulatory elements. In situ hybridisation of embryonic expression of the four RD genes in Drosophila melanogaster and the honeybee A. mellifera shows no evidence for either spatial or temporal co-linearity of expression during embryogenesis. Conclusion: All fully sequenced insect genomes contain four RD genes and orthology can be assigned to these genes based on similarity to the D. melanogaster protein sequences. Examination of the genomic organisation of these genes provides evidence for a functional RD gene cluster. RD genes from non-insect arthropods are also clustered, however the lack of orthology between these and insect RD genes suggests this cluster is likely to have resulted from a duplication event independent from that which created the insect RD gene cluster. Analysis of embryonic RD gene expression in two endopterygotan insects, A. mellifera and D. melanogaster, did not show evidence for coordinated gene expression, therefore while the functional significance of this gene cluster remains unknown its maintenance during insect evolution implies some functional significance to the cluster.",2008,"James M Smith, Peter K Dearden, Elizabeth J Duncan, Megan J Wilson"
Mitochondria and ageing in Drosophila,18446867,10.1002/biot.200800015,"Studies in different organisms have revealed that ageing is a complex process involving a tight regulation of gene expression. Among other features, ageing organisms generally display an increased oxidative stress and a decreased mitochondrial function. The increase in oxidative stress can be attributable to reactive oxygen species, which are mainly produced by mitochondria as a by-product of energy metabolism. Consistent with these data, mitochondria have been suggested to play a significant role in lifespan determination. The fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster is a well-suited organism to study ageing as it is relatively short-lived, mainly composed of post-mitotic cells, has sequenced nuclear and mitochondrial genomes, and multiple genetic tools are available. It has been used in genome-wide studies to unveil the molecular signature of ageing, in different feeding and dietary restriction protocols and in overexpression and down-regulation studies to examine the effect of specific compounds or genes/proteins on lifespan. Here we review the various features linking mitochondria and ageing in Drosophila melanogaster.",2008,"Robert M Tanguay, Geneviève Morrow"
Identification of Drosophila mutants altering defense of and endurance to Listeria monocytogenes infection,18245331,10.1534/genetics.107.083782,"We extended the use of Drosophila beyond being a model for signaling pathways required for pattern recognition immune signaling and show that the fly can be used to identify genes required for pathogenesis and host-pathogen interactions. We performed a forward genetic screen to identify Drosophila mutations altering sensitivity to the intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes. We recovered 18 mutants with increased susceptibility to infection, none of which were previously shown to function in a Drosophila immune response. Using secondary screens, we divided these mutants into two groups: In the first group, mutants have reduced endurance to infections but show no change in bacterial growth. This is a new fly immunity phenotype that is not commonly studied. In the second group, mutants have a typical defense defect in which bacterial growth is increased and survival is decreased. By further challenging mutant flies with L. monocytogenes mutants, we identified subgroups of fly mutants that affect specific stages of the L. monocytogenes life cycle, exit from the vacuole, or actin-based movement. There is no overlap between our genes and the hundreds of genes identified in Drosophila S2 cells fighting L. monocytogenes infection, using genomewide RNAi screens in vitro. By using a whole-animal model and screening for host survival, we revealed genes involved in physiologies different from those that were found in previous screens, which all had defects in defensive immune signaling.",2008,"Janelle S Ayres, Nancy Freitag, David S Schneider"
Drosophila Pxt: a cyclooxygenase-like facilitator of follicle maturation,18216169,10.1242/dev.017590,"Prostaglandins are local transient hormones that mediate a wide variety of biological events, including reproduction. The study of prostaglandin biology in a genetically tractable invertebrate model organism has been limited by the lack of clearly identified prostaglandin-mediated biological processes and prostaglandin metabolic genes, particularly analogs of cyclooxygenase (COX), the rate-limiting step in vertebrate prostaglandin synthesis. Here, we present pharmacological data that Drosophila ovarian follicle maturation requires COX-like activity and genetic evidence that this activity is supplied in vivo by the Drosophila peroxidase Pxt. pxt mutant females are sterile, and maturing follicles show defects in actin filament formation, nurse cell membrane stability and border cell migration. Maturation of pxt follicles in vitro is stimulated by prostaglandin treatment and fertility is restored in vivo to pxt mutants by expressing mammalian Cox1 protein. Our experiments suggest that prostaglandins promote Drosophila follicle maturation, in part by modulating the actin cytoskeleton, and establish Drosophila oogenesis as a model for understanding these critical biological regulators.",2008,"Tina L Tootle, Allan C Spradling"
The tumor suppressors Brat and Numb regulate transit-amplifying neuroblast lineages in Drosophila,18342578,10.1016/j.devcel.2008.03.004,"In both vertebrates and insects, neurons typically arise from neural stem cells or terminally dividing intermediate progenitors. Here, we describe another mode of neurogenesis where neural stem cells generate secondary precursors that undergo multiple rounds of self-renewing transit-amplifying divisions. We identify the Posterior Asense-Negative (PAN) neuroblasts, which do not express the transcription factors Asense or Prospero. PAN neuroblasts rely on the segregating determinants Numb and Brat to generate smaller, secondary neuroblasts that in turn give rise to ganglion mother cells (GMCs) and neurons throughout larval development. In brat or numb mutants, misspecified secondary neuroblasts are unable to produce differentiated progeny and initiate tumor-like overgrowth. In prospero mutants, however, tumors arise from GMCs while secondary neuroblasts are correctly specified. Our data describe a transit-amplifying lineage in the Drosophila nervous system and suggest that different vulnerabilities in intermediate cell types can affect the outcome of tumor suppressor loss in stem cell lineages.",2008,"Joerg Betschinger, Sarah K Bowman, Gregory Emery, Juergen A Knoblich, Kaolin A Kinsey, Vivien Rolland"
Requirement for a core 1 galactosyltransferase in the Drosophila nervous system,18985719,10.1002/dvdy.21775,"Mucin type O-glycosylation is a widespread modification of eukaryotic proteins, but its functional requirements remain incompletely understood. It is initiated by the attachment of N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) to Ser or Thr residues, and then elongated by additional sugars. We have examined requirements for mucin-type glycosylation in Drosophila by characterizing the expression and phenotypes of core 1 galactosyltransferases (core 1 GalTs), which elongate O-GalNAc by adding galactose in a beta1,3 linkage. Drosophila encode several putative core 1 GalTs, each expressed in distinct patterns. CG9520 (C1GalTA) is expressed in the amnioserosa and central nervous system. A null mutation in C1GalTA is lethal, and mutant animals exhibit a striking morphogenetic defect in which the ventral nerve cord is greatly elongated and the brain hemispheres are misshapen. Lectin staining and blotting experiments confirmed that C1GalTA contributes to the synthesis of Gal-beta1,3-GalNAc in vivo. Our results identify a role for mucin-type O-glycosylation during neural development in Drosophila.",2008,"Kenneth D Irvine, B V V G Reddy, Yuh-Ru Lin"
A permissive role of Notch in maintaining the DV affinity boundary of the Drosophila wing,18703041,10.1016/j.ydbio.2008.07.028,"Cell affinities can contribute to organizing cells into tissues and organs. Drosophila limbs and the vertebrate central nervous system are subdivided into adjacent populations that do not mix. These cell populations are called compartments. Cell interactions mediated by receptor Notch have been implicated in the specification of compartment boundaries. However, the contribution of Notch in this process remains controversial. The instructive role of Notch and the transcriptional requirement of the pathway have been questioned in the last few years. Due to its central role in making developmental boundaries in vertebrates and invertebrates, we have reevaluated the contribution of Notch and its signaling pathway in the maintenance of an affinity difference between dorsal (D) and ventral (V) compartments in the Drosophila wing. Here we present evidence that unrestricted, low levels of Notch are sufficient for the formation of a stable DV affinity boundary. Cleavage of the Notch protein, release of the intracellular domain and a transcriptional function of Notch via the Suppressor of Hairless transcription factor are required and sufficient in this process. Our data support a permissive role of Notch in maintaining the DV affinity boundary. This contrasts with the instructive role of Notch in executing the organizing activity of the DV boundary.",2008,"Isabelle Becam, Marco Milán"
Transformation of eye to antenna by misexpression of a single gene,18037276,10.1016/j.mod.2007.09.012,"In Drosophila, the eye and antenna originate from a single epithelium termed the eye-antennal imaginal disc. Illumination of the mechanisms that subdivide this epithelium into eye and antenna would enhance our understanding of the mechanisms that restrict stem cell fate. We show here that Dip3, a transcription factor required for eye development, alters fate determination when misexpressed in the early eye-antennal disc, and have taken advantage of this observation to gain new insight into the mechanisms controlling the eye-antennal switch. Dip3 misexpression yields extra antennae by two distinct mechanisms: the splitting of the antennal field into multiple antennal domains (antennal duplication), and the transformation of the eye disc to an antennal fate. Antennal duplication requires Dip3-induced under proliferation of the eye disc and concurrent over proliferation of the antennal disc. While previous studies have shown that overgrowth of the antennal disc can lead to antennal duplication, our results show that overgrowth is not sufficient for antennal duplication, which may require additional signals perhaps from the eye disc. Eye-to-antennal transformation appears to result from the combination of antennal selector gene activation, eye determination gene repression, and cell cycle perturbation in the eye disc. Both antennal duplication and eye-to-antennal transformation are suppressed by the expression of genes that drive the cell cycle providing support for tight coupling of cell fate determination and cell cycle control. The finding that this transformation occurs only in the eye disc, and not in other imaginal discs, suggests a close developmental and therefore evolutionary relationship between eyes and antennae.",2008,"Cheng Wei Wang, Hao A Duong, Y Henry Sun, Albert J Courey"
Microevolutionary support for a developmental hourglass: gene expression patterns shape sequence variation and divergence in Drosophila,18803776,10.1111/j.1525-142X.2008.00273.x,"A central goal of evolutionary developmental biology (Evo-Devo) is to synthesize comparative molecular developmental genetics and its description of the dynamic relationship between genotype and phenotype with the microevolutionary processes (mutation, random drift, and selection) of population genetics. To this end, we analyzed sequence variation of five gene classes that act sequentially to shape early embryo development in Drosophila: maternal, gap, pair-rule, segment polarity, and segment identity genes. We found two related patterns: (1) a microevolutionary pattern, wherein relative sequence variation within species is 2- to 3-fold higher for maternal-effect genes than for any other gene class; and, (2) a macroevolutionary pattern, wherein the relative sequence divergence among species for maternal-effect genes is 2- to 4-fold greater than for any other gene class. Both patterns are qualitatively and quantitatively consistent with the predictions of microevolutionary theory. Our findings connect within-species genetic variation to between-species divergence and shed light on the controversy over the existence of a ""developmental hourglass,"" where mid-embryonic stages are more evolutionarily constrained than either earlier or later stages. Because maternal-effect genes experience relaxed selective constraint relative to zygotic-effect genes, they explore a wider mutational and phenotypic space. As a result, early acting maternal-effect genes diverge more widely across taxa and thereby broaden the base of the developmental hourglass. In contrast, later acting zygotic genes are relatively more constrained and limited in their diversification across taxa, narrowing the waist of the developmental hourglass. This pattern is obscured by genes with both maternal and zygotic expression, which experience the strongest evolutionary constraint.",2008,"Tami Cruickshank, Michael J Wade"
TrackFly: virtual reality for a behavioral system analysis in free-flying fruit flies,18405978,10.1016/j.jneumeth.2008.02.016,"Modern neuroscience and the interest in biomimetic control design demand increasingly sophisticated experimental techniques that can be applied in freely moving animals under realistic behavioral conditions. To explore sensorimotor flight control mechanisms in free-flying fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster), we equipped a wind tunnel with a Virtual Reality (VR) display system based on standard digital hardware and a 3D path tracking system. We demonstrate the experimental power of this approach by example of a 'one-parameter open loop' testing paradigm. It provided (1) a straightforward measure of transient responses in presence of open loop visual stimulation; (2) high data throughput and standardized measurement conditions from process automation; and (3) simplified data analysis due to well-defined testing conditions. Being based on standard hardware and software techniques, our methods provide an affordable, easy to replicate and general solution for a broad range of behavioral applications in freely moving animals.

A comparison of the stc and Lim3 genes showed that the extent of polymorphism was similar in their introns and corresponded to the variation level characteristic of Drosophila melanogaster, while the putative regulatory region and first intron of the stc gene proved to be more variable than the corresponding regions of the Lim3 gene. Since the genes under study occurred on the same chromosomes isolated from one population and were close together in a region having a high recombination rate, the difference in the extent of polymorphism between the regulatory and coding regions was explained by individual characteristics of each gene. The results made it possible to assume that the extent of polymorphism of the coding gene regions is maintained by balancing selection.",2008,"E G Pasiukova, O Iu Rybina, A V Simonenko"
Drosophila processing bodies in oogenesis,18708044,10.1016/j.ydbio.2008.07.033,"Processing bodies (P-bodies) have emerged as important subcellular structures that are involved in mRNA metabolism. To date, a detailed description of P-bodies in Drosophila oogenesis is lacking. To this end, we first demonstrate that Drosophila decapping protein 2 (dDcp2) contains intrinsic decapping activity and its enzymatic activity was not detectably enhanced by Drosophila decapping protein 1 (dDcp1). dDcp1-containing bodies in the nurse cell cytoplasm can associate with the 5' to 3' exoribonuclease, Pacman in addition to dDcp2 and Me31B. The size and number of dDcp1 bodies are dynamic and dramatically increased in dDcp2 and pacman mutant backgrounds supporting the conclusion that dDcp1 bodies in nurse cell cytoplasm are Drosophila P-bodies. In stage 2-6 oocytes, dDcp1 bodies appear to be distinct from previously characterized P-bodies since they are insensitive to cycloheximide and RNase A treatments. Curiously, dDcp2 and Pacman do not colocalize with dDcp1 at the posterior end of the oocyte in stage 9-10 oocytes. This suggests that dDcp1 bodies are in a developmentally distinct state separate from the 5' end mRNA degradation enzymes at later stages in the oocyte. Interestingly, re-formation of maternally expressed dDcp1 with dDcp2 and Pacman was observed in early embryogenesis. With respect to developmental switching, the maternal dDcp1 is proposed to serve as a marker for the re-formation of P-bodies in early embryos. This also suggests that a regulated conversion occurs between maternal RNA granules and P-bodies from oogenesis to embryogenesis.",2008,"Sarah F Newbury, Ming-Der Lin, Xinfu Jiao, Dominic Grima, Tze-Bin Chou, Megerditch Kiledjian"
"Opossum carboxylesterases: sequences, phylogeny and evidence for CES gene duplication events predating the marsupial-eutherian common ancestor",18289373,10.1186/1471-2148-8-54,"Background: Carboxylesterases (CES) perform diverse metabolic roles in mammalian organisms in the detoxification of a broad range of drugs and xenobiotics and may also serve in specific roles in lipid, cholesterol, pheromone and lung surfactant metabolism. Five CES families have been reported in mammals with human CES1 and CES2 the most extensively studied. Here we describe the genetics, expression and phylogeny of CES isozymes in the opossum and report on the sequences and locations of CES1, CES2 and CES6 'like' genes within two gene clusters on chromosome one. We also discuss the likely sequence of gene duplication events generating multiple CES genes during vertebrate evolution. Results: We report a cDNA sequence for an opossum CES and present evidence for CES1 and CES2 like genes expressed in opossum liver and intestine and for distinct gene locations of five opossum CES genes,CES1, CES2.1, CES2.2, CES2.3 and CES6, on chromosome 1. Phylogenetic and sequence alignment studies compared the predicted amino acid sequences for opossum CES with those for human, mouse, chicken, frog, salmon and Drosophila CES gene products. Phylogenetic analyses produced congruent phylogenetic trees depicting a rapid early diversification into at least five distinct CES gene family clusters: CES2, CES1, CES7, CES3, and CES6. Molecular divergence estimates based on a Bayesian relaxed clock approach revealed an origin for the five mammalian CES gene families between 328-378 MYA. Conclusion: The deduced amino acid sequence for an opossum cDNA was consistent with its identity as a mammalian CES2 gene product (designated CES2.1). Distinct gene locations for opossum CES1 (1: 446,222,550-446,274,850), three CES2 genes (1: 677,773,395-677,927,030) and a CES6 gene (1: 677,585,520-677,730,419) were observed on chromosome 1. Opossum CES1 and multiple CES2 genes were expressed in liver and intestine. Amino acid sequences for opossum CES1 and three CES2 gene products revealed conserved residues previously reported for human CES1 involved in catalysis, ligand binding, tertiary structure and organelle localization.

Transcription-coupled methylation of histone H3 at lysine 36 regulates dosage compensation by enhancing recruitment of the MSL complex in Drosophila melanogaster,18347056,10.1128/MCB.00006-08,"In Drosophila melanogaster, dosage compensation relies on the targeting of the male-specific lethal (MSL) complex to hundreds of sites along the male X chromosome. Transcription-coupled methylation of histone H3 lysine 36 is enriched toward the 3' end of active genes, similar to the MSL proteins. Here, we have studied the link between histone H3 methylation and MSL complex targeting using RNA interference and chromatin immunoprecipitation. We show that trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 36 (H3K36me3) relies on the histone methyltransferase Hypb and is localized promoter distal at dosage-compensated genes, similar to active genes on autosomes. However, H3K36me3 has an X-specific function, as reduction specifically decreases acetylation of histone H4 lysine 16 on the male X chromosome. This hypoacetylation is caused by compromised MSL binding and results in a failure to increase expression twofold. Thus, H3K36me3 marks the body of all active genes yet is utilized in a chromosome-specific manner to enhance histone acetylation at sites of dosage compensation.",2008,"Dirk Schübeler, Thomas Conrad, Asifa Akhtar, Jop Kind, Oliver Bell, Christiane Wirbelauer"

Recently, Hare et al., using elegant wet and computational approaches uncovered a series of enhancers driving the expression of the even-skipped gene in scavenger flies (Sepsidae). Despite the strong sequence divergence between the enhancers in sepsids and drosophilids, they lead to remarkably similar patterns of gene expression in transgenic Drosophila embryos.

Mushroom bodies modulate salience-based selective fixation behavior in Drosophila,18364023,10.1111/j.1460-9568.2008.06114.x,"Mushroom bodies (MBs), one of the central brain structures in Drosophila melanogaster, are involved in several cognitive behaviors, such as olfactory learning and memory, visual context generalization, choice behavior facing conflicting cues. Attention is a cognitive behavior, and it facilitates a focus on the attended event while filtering out irrelevant events, thereby allowing more rapid and accurate reactions at a lower threshold in primates. Using the visual orientation paradigm in a flight simulator, we observed that MBs modulate salience-based selective fixation behavior, which resembles attention in primates to a certain degree. We found that the fixation ability of MB-deficient flies was significantly reduced when the contrast levels were lowered as well as when a certain amount of background noise was applied. Moreover, MB-deficient flies exhibited poor object fixation ability in the presence of an olfactory 'distracter'. Furthermore, during visual selection among multiple objects of different contrast, flies with MBs were able to 'pop-out' of the most salient object in a three-object selection paradigm. Finally, we determined that flies exhibited cross-modal synergistic integration between olfactory and visual signals during object-fixation behavior, which was independent of MBs. Taken together, our findings suggest that MBs do not contribute to cross-modal synergetic integration between olfactory and visual signals; instead, they confer sensory gain control and inhibitory gating in flies, this property allows entry of the salient signal as well as filters out background noise and irrelevant signals.",2008,"Jianzeng Guo, Aike Guo, Yueqing Peng, Yizhou Ye, Feng Yu, Ke Zhang, Wang Xi"

In order to perform such a screen a simple and fast method to identify changes in the metabolic state of flies is necessary.

In this protocol we introduce a simple method to measure CO2 output from flies.

Inhibition of transport by EF1γ requires its phosphorylation by DOA on serine 294.

Indeed, the Notch signaling pathway plays key roles in cell fate decisions, tissue patterning, and morphogenesis during development. However, deregulation of this pathway can contribute to cell transformation and tumorigenesis.

BICD2-deficient mice develop disrupted laminar organization of cerebral cortex and the cerebellum, pointing to impaired radial neuronal migration. Using astrocyte and granule cell specific inactivation of BICD2, we show that the cerebellar migration defect is entirely dependent upon BICD2 expression in Bergmann glia cells.

"On the Coyne and Orr-igin of species: effects of intrinsic postzygotic isolation, ecological differentiation, x chromosome size, and sympatry on Drosophila speciation",24325145,10.1111/evo.12330,"Coyne and Orr found that mating discrimination (premating isolation) evolves much faster between sympatric than allopatric Drosophila species pairs. Their meta-analyses established that this pattern, expected under reinforcement, is common and that Haldane's rule is ubiquitous in Drosophila species divergence. We examine three possible contributors to the reinforcement pattern: intrinsic postzygotic isolation, dichotomized as to whether hybrid males show complete inviability/sterility; host-plant divergence, as a surrogate for extrinsic postzygotic isolation; and X chromosome size, whether roughly 20% or 40% of the genome is X-linked. We focus on ""young"" species pairs with overlapping ranges, contrasted with allopatric pairs. Using alternative criteria for ""sympatry"" and tests that compare either level of prezygotic isolation in sympatry or frequency of sympatry, we find no statistically significant effects associated with X chromosome size or our coarse quantifications of intrinsic postzygotic isolation or ecological differentiation. Although sympatric speciation seems very rare in animals, the pervasiveness of the reinforcement pattern and the commonness of range overlap for close relatives indicate that speciation in Drosophila is often not purely allopatric. It remains to determine whether increased premating isolation with sympatry results from secondary contact versus parapatric speciation and what drives this pattern.",2014,"Jeremy R Lipkowitz, Michael Turelli, Yaniv Brandvain"

Female GSCs display high levels of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) transcription, and Udd becomes enriched in GSCs relative to their differentiating daughters. Increasing Pol I transcription delays differentiation, whereas reducing rRNA production induces both morphological changes that accompany multicellular cyst formation and specific decreased expression of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathway component Mad. These findings demonstrate that modulating rRNA synthesis fosters changes in the cell fate, growth, and proliferation of female Drosophila GSCs and their daughters.",2014,"Nevine A Shalaby, Michael Buszczak, Qiao Zhang"
gga-miR-375 plays a key role in tumorigenesis post subgroup J avian leukosis virus infection,24694742,10.1371/journal.pone.0090878,"Avian leukosis is a neoplastic disease caused in part by subgroup J avian leukosis virus J (ALV-J). Micro ribonucleic acids (miRNAs) play pivotal oncogenic and tumour-suppressor roles in tumour development and progression. However, little is known about the potential role of miRNAs in avian leukosis tumours. We have found a novel tumour-suppressor miRNA, gga-miR-375, associated with avian leukosis tumorigenesis by miRNA microarray in a previous report. We have also previously studied the biological function of gga-miR-375; Overexpression of gga-miR-375 significantly inhibited DF-1 cell proliferation, and significantly reduced the expression of yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) by repressing the activity of a luciferase reporter carrying the 3'-untranslated region of YAP1. This indicates that gga-miR-375 is frequently downregulated in avian leukosis by inhibiting cell proliferation through YAP1 oncogene targeting. Overexpression of gga-miR-375 markedly promoted serum starvation induced apoptosis, and there may be the reason why the tumour cycle is so long in the infected chickens. In vivo assays, gga-miR-375 was significantly downregulated in chicken livers 20 days after infection with ALV-J, and YAP1 was significantly upregulated 20 days after ALV-J infection (P<0.05). We also found that expression of cyclin E, an important regulator of cell cycle progression, was significantly upregulated (P<0.05). Drosophila inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1 (DIAP1), which is related to caspase-dependent apoptosis, was also significantly upregulated after infection. Our data suggests that gga-miR-375 may function as a tumour suppressor thereby regulating cancer cell proliferation and it plays a key role in avian leukosis tumorigenesis.",2014,"Dingming Shu, Hongmei Li, Huanmin Zhang, Huiqing Shang, Baoli Sun, Qingmei Xie, Hongxin Li, Jun Ji"
The making of a pest: the evolution of a fruit-penetrating ovipositor in Drosophila suzukii and related species,24573846,10.1098/rspb.2013.2840,"Evolutionary innovation can allow a species access to a new ecological niche, potentially reducing competition with closely related species. While the vast majority of Drosophila flies feed on rotting fruit and other decaying matter, and are harmless to human activity, Drosophila suzukii, which has a morphologically modified ovipositor, is capable of colonizing live fruit that is still in the process of ripening, causing massive agricultural damage. Here, we conducted the first comparative analysis of this species and its close relatives, analysing both ovipositor structure and fruit susceptibility. We found that the ovipositor of the species most closely related to D. suzukii, Drosophila subpulchrella, has a similar number of enlarged, evolutionarily derived bristles, but a notably different overall shape. Like D. suzukii, D. subpulchrella flies are capable of puncturing the skin of raspberries and cherries, but we found no evidence that they could penetrate the thicker skin of two varieties of grapes. More distantly related species, one of which has previously been mistaken for D. suzukii, have blunt ovipositors with small bristles. While they did not penetrate fruit skin in any of the assays, they readily colonized fruit interiors where the skin was broken. Our results suggest that considering evolutionary context may be beneficial to the management of invasive species.",2014,"Artyom Kopp, Raul Salazar, Joel Atallah, Lisa Teixeira, George Zaragoza"
Distinct roles of arrestin 1 protein in photoreceptors during Drosophila development,24838243,10.1074/jbc.M114.571224,"Arrestin regulates many facets of G-protein coupled receptor signaling. In Drosophila, Arrestin 1 (Arr1) is expressed at a lower level than Arrestin 2 (Arr2), and the role of Arr1 in visual physiology is less understood. Here we generated transgenic flies expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein tagged Arr1 (Arr1-eGFP) and explored its trafficking in live photoreceptors. We show that Arr1-eGFP is localized in the cytoplasm and displays light-dependent translocation to the rhabdomere possibly by interacting with photoactivated rhodopsin 1 (Rh1*). In the adult, translocation of Arr1-eGFP occurs with slower kinetics when compared with that of Arr2-eGFP. This slower kinetic activity may be attributable to a reduced level of phosphorylated Rh1*. Indeed, a reduced level of phosphorylated Rh1* recruits a lower level of Arr1-eGFP to rhabdomeres. To investigate whether Arr1 is required for the deactivation of phosphorylated Rh1*, we show that in flies with reduced Arr1 prolonged depolarizing afterpotential can be triggered with fewer light pulses, indicating that inactivation of phosphorylated Rh1* is compromised when the Arr1 level is reduced. Consistently, Arr1 is no longer required for deactivation of Rh1 in flies expressing phosphorylation-deficient Rh1. Previously it was reported that Arr1 displays light-dependent internalization. Unexpectedly, in adult photoreceptors we failed to observe endocytosis of Arr1-eGFP. In contrast, we show that in pupal photoreceptors Arr1-eGFP becomes internalized and sequestered in vesicles within the cytoplasm. Taken together, we propose that Arr1 plays distinct roles during development and adulthood. Arr1 orchestrates the recycling of phosphorylated Rh1* in pupae whereas it regulates the deactivation in adult.",2014,"Inga Kristaponyte, Bih-Hwa Shieh, Yuan Hong"
The KRÜPPEL-like transcription factor DATILÓGRAFO is required in specific cholinergic neurons for sexual receptivity in Drosophila females,25291190,10.1371/journal.pbio.1001964,"Courtship is a widespread behavior in which one gender conveys to the other a series of cues about their species identity, gender, and suitability as mates. In many species, females decode these male displays and either accept or reject them. Despite the fact that courtship has been investigated for a long time, the genes and circuits that allow females to generate these mutually exclusive responses remain largely unknown. Here, we provide evidence that the Krüppel-like transcription factor datilógrafo (dati) is required for proper locomotion and courtship acceptance in adult Drosophila females. dati mutant females are completely unable to decode male courtship and almost invariably reject males. Molecular analyses reveal that dati is broadly expressed in the brain and its specific removal in excitatory cholinergic neurons recapitulates the female courtship behavioral phenotype but not the locomotor deficits, indicating that these are two separable functions. Clonal analyses in female brains identified three discrete foci where dati is required to generate acceptance. These include neurons around the antennal lobe, the lateral horn, and the posterior superior lateral protocerebrum. Together, these results show that dati is required to organize and maintain a relatively simple excitatory circuit in the brain that allows females to either accept or reject courting males.",2014,"Rachel Lynn Giesey, Rui Sousa-Neves, Claudia Mieko Mizutani, Tamas Lukacsovich, Joseph Moeller Schinaman"
Pre- and Postsynaptic Role of Dopamine D2 Receptor DD2R in Drosophila Olfactory Associative Learning,25422852,10.3390/biology3040831,"Dopaminergic neurons in Drosophila play critical roles in diverse brain functions such as motor control, arousal, learning, and memory. Using genetic and behavioral approaches, it has been firmly established that proper dopamine signaling is required for olfactory classical conditioning (e.g., aversive and appetitive learning). Dopamine mediates its functions through interaction with its receptors. There are two different types of dopamine receptors in Drosophila: D1-like (dDA1, DAMB) and D2-like receptors (DD2R). Currently, no study has attempted to characterize the role of DD2R in Drosophila learning and memory. Using a DD2R-RNAi transgenic line, we have examined the role of DD2R, expressed in dopamine neurons (i.e., the presynaptic DD2R autoreceptor), in larval olfactory learning. The function of postsynaptic DD2R expressed in mushroom body (MB) was also studied as MB is the center for Drosophila learning, with a function analogous to that of the mammalian hippocampus. Our results showed that suppression of presynaptic DD2R autoreceptors impairs both appetitive and aversive learning. Similarly, postsynaptic DD2R in MB neurons appears to be involved in both appetitive and aversive learning. The data confirm, for the first time, that DD2R plays an important role in Drosophila olfactory learning.",2014,"Daewoo Lee, Cheng Qi"
Interaction of delta-like 1 homolog (Drosophila) with prohibitins and its impact on tumor cell clonogenicity,24249679,10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-13-0360,"Cancer stem cell characteristics, especially their self-renewal and clonogenic potentials, play an essential role in malignant progression and response to anticancer therapies. Currently, it remains largely unknown what pathways are involved in the regulation of cancer cell stemness and differentiation. Previously, we found that delta-like 1 homolog (Drosophila) or DLK1, a developmentally regulated gene, plays a critical role in the regulation of differentiation, self-renewal, and tumorigenic growth of neuroblastoma cells. Here, we show that DLK1 specifically interacts with the prohibitin 1 (PHB1) and PHB2, two closely related genes with pleiotropic functions, including regulation of mitochondrial function and gene transcription. DLK1 interacts with the PHB1-PHB2 complex via its cytoplasmic domain and regulates mitochondrial functions, including mitochondrial membrane potential and production of reactive oxygen species. We have further found that PHB1 and especially PHB2 regulate cancer cell self-renewal as well as their clonogenic potential. Hence, the DLK1-PHB interaction constitutes a new signaling pathway that maintains clonogenicity and self-renewal potential of cancer cells.

Fenestration: a window of opportunity for carnivorous plants,24789140,10.1098/rsbl.2014.0134,"A long-standing but controversial hypothesis assumes that carnivorous plants employ aggressive mimicry to increase their prey capture success. A possible mechanism is that pitcher plants use aggressive mimicry to deceive prey about the location of the pitcher's exit. Specifically, species from unrelated families sport fenestration, i.e. transparent windows on the upper surfaces of pitchers which might function to mimic the exit of the pitcher. This hypothesis has not been evaluated against alternative hypotheses predicting that fenestration functions to attract insects from afar. By manipulating fenestration, we show that it does not increase the number of Drosophila flies or of two ant species entering pitchers in Sarracenia minor nor their retention time or a pitcher's capture success. However, fenestration increased the number of Drosophila flies alighting on the pitcher compared with pitchers of the same plant without fenestration. We thus suggest that fenestration in S. minor is not an example of aggressive mimicry but rather functions in long-range attraction of prey. We highlight the need to evaluate aggressive mimicry relative to alternative concepts of plant-animal communication.",2014,"Graeme D Ruxton, H Martin Schaefer"
TRPML1: an ion channel in the lysosome,24756723,10.1007/978-3-642-54215-2_24,"The first member of the mammalian mucolipin TRP channel subfamily (TRPML1) is a cation-permeable channel that is predominantly localized on the membranes of late endosomes and lysosomes (LELs) in all mammalian cell types. In response to the regulatory changes of LEL-specific phosphoinositides or other cellular cues, TRPML1 may mediate the release of Ca(2+) and heavy metal Fe(2+)/Zn(2+)ions into the cytosol from the LEL lumen, which in turn may regulate membrane trafficking events (fission and fusion), signal transduction, and ionic homeostasis in LELs. Human mutations in TRPML1 result in type IV mucolipidosis (ML-IV), a childhood neurodegenerative lysosome storage disease. At the cellular level, loss-of-function mutations of mammalian TRPML1 or its C. elegans or Drosophila homolog gene results in lysosomal trafficking defects and lysosome storage. In this chapter, we summarize recent advances in our understandings of the cell biological and channel functions of TRPML1.

Toxicity and localization studies of a potential photodynamic therapy agent in Drosophila,24616213,10.1002/dvg.22760,"Photodynamic therapy utilizes light, a photosensitizer, and molecular oxygen as a treatment modality for a variety of cancers.

To determine the toxicity and cell viability of this compound in-vivo we present, herein, a study using Drosophila melanogaster. In the absence of light, the new photosensitizer shows no discernible effects to fly larvae at various concentrations of compound and stages of larval development.

Multiple regulatory safeguards confine the expression of the GATA factor Serpent to the hemocyte primordium within the Drosophila mesoderm,24360907,10.1016/j.ydbio.2013.12.012,"serpent (srp) encodes a GATA-factor that controls various aspects of embryogenesis in Drosophila, such as fatbody development, gut differentiation and hematopoiesis.

Here, we find that srp is sufficient to transform trunk mesoderm into hemocytes. We identify two disjoint cis-regulatory modules that direct the early expression in the hemocyte primordium and the late expression in mature hemocytes and lymph gland, respectively. During embryonic hematopoiesis, a combination of snail, buttonhead, empty spiracles and even-skipped confines the mesodermal srp expression to the head region. This restriction to the head mesoderm is crucial as ectopic srp in mesodermal precursors interferes with the development of mesodermal derivates and promotes hemocytes and fatbody development. Thus, several genes work in a combined fashion to restrain early srp expression to the head mesoderm in order to prevent expansion of the hemocyte primordium.",2014,"Sven Huelsmann, Klaus-Peter Rehorn, Stefanie Mischke, Andreu Casali, Philipp Spahn, Melanie Mayer, Rolf Reuter"
Euchromatic transposon insertions trigger production of novel Pi- and endo-siRNAs at the target sites in the drosophila germline,24516406,10.1371/journal.pgen.1004138,"The control of transposable element (TE) activity in germ cells provides genome integrity over generations. A distinct small RNA-mediated pathway utilizing Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) suppresses TE expression in gonads of metazoans. In the fly, primary piRNAs derive from so-called piRNA clusters, which are enriched in damaged repeated sequences. These piRNAs launch a cycle of TE and piRNA cluster transcript cleavages resulting in the amplification of piRNA and TE silencing. Using genome-wide comparison of TE insertions and ovarian small RNA libraries from two Drosophila strains, we found that individual TEs inserted into euchromatic loci form novel dual-stranded piRNA clusters. Formation of the piRNA-generating loci by active individual TEs provides a more potent silencing response to the TE expansion. Like all piRNA clusters, individual TEs are also capable of triggering the production of endogenous small interfering (endo-si) RNAs. Small RNA production by individual TEs spreads into the flanking genomic regions including coding cellular genes. We show that formation of TE-associated small RNA clusters can down-regulate expression of nearby genes in ovaries. Integration of TEs into the 3' untranslated region of actively transcribed genes induces piRNA production towards the 3'-end of transcripts, causing the appearance of genic piRNA clusters, a phenomenon that has been reported in different organisms. These data suggest a significant role of TE-associated small RNAs in the evolution of regulatory networks in the germline.",2014,"Sergei Ryazansky, Yuri Abramov, Ivan Olovnikov, Sergey Shpiz, Alla Kalmykova"

On the origins of the mitotic shift in proliferating cell layers,24886286,10.1186/1742-4682-11-26,"Background: During plant and animal development, monolayer cell sheets display a stereotyped distribution of polygonal cell shapes. In interphase cells these shapes range from quadrilaterals to decagons, with a robust average of six sides per cell. In contrast, the subset of cells in mitosis exhibits a distinct distribution with an average of seven sides. It remains unclear whether this 'mitotic shift' reflects a causal relationship between increased polygonal sidedness and increased division likelihood, or alternatively, a passive effect of local proliferation on cell shape. Methods: We use a combination of probabilistic analysis and mathematical modeling to predict the geometry of mitotic polygonal cells in a proliferating cell layer. To test these predictions experimentally, we use Flp-Out stochastic labeling in the Drosophila wing disc to induce single cell clones, and confocal imaging to quantify the polygonal topologies of these clones as a function of cellular age. For a more generic test in an idealized cell layer, we model epithelial sheet proliferation in a finite element framework, which yields a computationally robust, emergent prediction of the mitotic cell shape distribution. Results: Using both mathematical and experimental approaches, we show that the mitotic shift derives primarily from passive, non-autonomous effects of mitoses in neighboring cells on each cell's geometry over the course of the cell cycle. Computationally, we predict that interphase cells should passively gain sides over time, such that cells at more advanced stages of the cell cycle will tend to have a larger number of neighbors than those at earlier stages. Validating this prediction, experimental analysis of randomly labeled epithelial cells in the Drosophila wing disc demonstrates that labeled cells exhibit an age-dependent increase in polygonal sidedness. Reinforcing these data, finite element simulations of epithelial sheet proliferation demonstrate in a generic framework that passive side-gaining is sufficient to generate a mitotic shift. Conclusions: Taken together, our results strongly suggest that the mitotic shift reflects a time-dependent accumulation of shared cellular interfaces over the course of the cell cycle. These results uncover fundamental constraints on the relationship between cell shape and cell division that should be general in adherent, polarized cell layers.",2014,"Radhika Nagpal, James H Veldhuis, G Wayne Brodland, William T Gibson, Matthew C Gibson, Emily J Meyer, Boris Y Rubinstein"
Fruiting bodies of the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum increase spore transport by Drosophila,24884856,10.1186/1471-2148-14-105,"Background: Many microbial phenotypes are the product of cooperative interactions among cells, but their putative fitness benefits are often not well understood. In the cellular slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum, unicellular amoebae aggregate when starved and form multicellular fruiting bodies in which stress-resistant spores are held aloft by dead stalk cells. Fruiting bodies are thought to be adaptations for dispersing spores to new feeding sites, but this has not been directly tested. Here we experimentally test whether fruiting bodies increase the rate at which spores are acquired by passing invertebrates. Results: Drosophila melanogaster accumulate spores on their surfaces more quickly when exposed to intact fruiting bodies than when exposed to fruiting bodies physically disrupted to dislodge spore masses from stalks. Flies also ingest and excrete spores that still express a red fluorescent protein marker. Conclusions: Multicellular fruiting bodies created by D. discoideum increase the likelihood that invertebrates acquire spores that can then be transported to new feeding sites.

TEMP: a computational method for analyzing transposable element polymorphism in populations,24753423,10.1093/nar/gku323,"Insertions and excisions of transposable elements (TEs) affect both the stability and variability of the genome. Studying the dynamics of transposition at the population level can provide crucial insights into the processes and mechanisms of genome evolution. Pooling genomic materials from multiple individuals followed by high-throughput sequencing is an efficient way of characterizing genomic polymorphisms in a population. Here we describe a novel method named TEMP, specifically designed to detect TE movements present with a wide range of frequencies in a population. By combining the information provided by pair-end reads and split reads, TEMP is able to identify both the presence and absence of TE insertions in genomic DNA sequences derived from heterogeneous samples; accurately estimate the frequencies of transposition events in the population and pinpoint junctions of high frequency transposition events at nucleotide resolution. Simulation data indicate that TEMP outperforms other algorithms such as PoPoolationTE, RetroSeq, VariationHunter and GASVPro. TEMP also performs well on whole-genome human data derived from the 1000 Genomes Project. We applied TEMP to characterize the TE frequencies in a wild Drosophila melanogaster population and study the inheritance patterns of TEs during hybrid dysgenesis.

Mitochondrial genome linearization is a causative factor for cardiomyopathy in mice and Drosophila,23909626,10.1089/ars.2013.5432,"Aims: Mitofusin (Mfn)2 redundantly promotes mitochondrial outer membrane tethering and organelle fusion with Mfn1, and uniquely functions as the mitochondrial receptor for Parkin during PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1)-Parkin-mediated mitophagy. Selective deletion of Mfn2 with retention of Mfn1 preserves mitochondrial fusion while rendering damaged mitochondria resistant to normal quality control culling mechanisms. Consequently, neuron and cardiomyocyte-specific Mfn2 gene ablation is associated with accumulation of damaged mitochondria and organ dysfunction. Here, we determined how mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage contributes to cardiomyopathy in Mfn2-deficient hearts. Results: RNA sequencing of Mfn2-deficient hearts revealed increased expression of some nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes, but mitochondrial-encoded transcripts were not upregulated in parallel and mtDNA content was decreased. Ultra-deep sequencing of mtDNA showed no increase in single nucleotide mutations, but copy number variations representing insertion-deletion (in-del) mutations were induced over time by cardiomyocyte-specific Mfn2 deficiency. Double-strand mtDNA breaks in the form of in-dels were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction, and in the form of linear mitochondrial genomes were identified by southern blot analysis. Linearization of Drosophila cardiomyocyte mtDNA using conditional cardiomyocyte-specific expression of mitochondrial targeted XhoI recapitulated the cardiomyopathy of Mfn2-deficient mouse hearts. Innovation: This is the first description of mitochondrial genome linearization as a causative factor in cardiomyopathy.

We demonstrate that the sperm mitochondrial derivative (MD) is rapidly eliminated in a stereotypical process dubbed paternal mitochondrial destruction (PMD). PMD is initiated by a network of vesicles resembling multivesicular bodies and displaying common features of the endocytic and autophagic pathways. These vesicles associate with the sperm tail and mediate the disintegration of its plasma membrane. Subsequently, the MD separates from the axoneme and breaks into smaller fragments, which are then sequestered by autophagosomes for degradation in lysosomes. We further provide evidence for the involvement of the ubiquitin pathway and the autophagy receptor p62 in this process. Finally, we show that the ubiquitin ligase Parkin is not involved in PMD, implying a divergence from the autophagic pathway of damaged mitochondria.",2014,"Liron Gal, Yoav Politi, Liat Ravid, Eli Arama, Yossi Kalifa, Zvulun Elazar"

Different genes, such as Hsp70, Hsc70, Hsp90, and Hsp40, have been identified in this species as sensitive biomarkers for xenobiotics, but small Hsps genes remain largely unknown. In this study, the Hsp27 has been characterized in C. riparius and its transcriptional response evaluated under several environmental stimuli. The Hsp27 gene was mapped by FISH on polytene chromosomes at region I-C4 and was found to encode a 195 aa protein, which contains an α-crystallin domain bounded by three conserved regions. This protein shows homology with Drosophila melanogaster HSP27, Ceratitis capitata HSP27, and Sarcophaga crassipalpis HSP25. Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that heat shock (35 °C) and cadmium dramatically upregulate this gene. Moreover, exposures to triclosan and bisphenol A were able to significantly increase mRNA levels. However, neither nonylphenol nor tributyltin altered Hsp27 gene expression. The transcriptional activity of Hsp27 gene was modulated during cold stress. Interestingly, cold shock (4 °C) significantly reduced Hsp27 transcripts, but this gene was significantly overexpressed during the recovery time at the normal growing temperature.

Different regulatory mechanisms underlie similar transposable element profiles in pufferfish and fruitflies,15342795,10.1093/molbev/msh243,"Comparative analysis of recently sequenced eukaryotic genomes has uncovered extensive variation in transposable element (TE) abundance, diversity, and distribution. The TE profile in the sequenced pufferfish genomes is more similar to that of Drosophila melanogaster than to human or mouse, in that pufferfish TEs exhibit low overall abundance, high family diversity, and localization in the heterochromatin. It has been suggested that selection against the deleterious effects of ectopic recombination between TEs has structured the TE profile in Drosophila and pufferfish but not in humans. We test this hypothesis by measuring the sample frequency of 48 euchromatic TE insertions in the genome of the green spotted pufferfish (Tetraodon nigroviridis). We estimate the strength of selection acting on recent insertions by analyzing the site frequency spectrum using a maximum-likelihood approach. We show that in contrast to Drosophila, euchromatic TE insertions in Tetraodon are selectively neutral and that the low copy number and compartmentalized distribution of TEs in the Tetraodon genome must be caused by regulation by means other than purifying selection acting on recent insertions. Inference of regulatory processes governing TE profiles should take into account factors such as effective population size, incidence of inbreeding/outcrossing, and other species-specific traits.",2004,"Daniel E Neafsey, Daniel L Hartl, Justin P Blumenstiel"
"Wnt signals across the plasma membrane to activate the beta-catenin pathway by forming oligomers containing its receptors, Frizzled and LRP",15459103,10.1242/dev.01318,"Wnt-induced signaling via beta-catenin plays crucial roles in animal development and tumorigenesis. Both a seven-transmembrane protein in the Frizzled family and a single transmembrane protein in the LRP family (LDL-receptor-related protein 5/6 or Arrow) are essential for efficiently transducing a signal from Wnt, an extracellular ligand, to an intracellular pathway that stabilizes beta-catenin by interfering with its rate of destruction. However, the molecular mechanism by which these two types of membrane receptors synergize to transmit the Wnt signal is not known. We have used mutant and chimeric forms of Frizzled, LRP and Wnt proteins, small inhibitory RNAs, and assays for beta-catenin-mediated signaling and protein localization in Drosophila S2 cells and mammalian 293 cells to study transmission of a Wnt signal across the plasma membrane. Our findings are consistent with a mechanism by which Wnt protein binds to the extracellular domains of both LRP and Frizzled receptors, forming membrane-associated hetero-oligomers that interact with both Disheveled (via the intracellular portions of Frizzled) and Axin (via the intracellular domain of LRP). This model takes into account several observations reported here: the identification of intracellular residues of Frizzled required for beta-catenin signaling and for recruitment of Dvl to the plasma membrane; evidence that Wnt3A binds to the ectodomains of LRP and Frizzled; and demonstrations that a requirement for Wnt ligand can be abrogated by chimeric receptors that allow formation of Frizzled-LRP hetero-oligomers. In addition, the beta-catenin signaling mediated by ectopic expression of LRP is not dependent on Disheveled or Wnt, but can also be augmented by oligomerization of LRP receptors.",2004,"Feng Cong, Liang Schweizer, Harold Varmus"
Mobilization and fusion of a non-recycling pool of synaptic vesicles under conditions of endocytic blockade,15458843,10.1016/j.neuropharm.2004.07.026,"At vertebrate central synapses, it has been demonstrated that a resting pool of synaptic vesicles (SVs) exists that normally does not participate in SV release and recycling. It remains unclear whether SVs within the resting pool are capable of mobilization and fusion. Here, we combine live imaging of SV exo- and endocytosis using pH-sensitive GFP (synapto-pHluorins) with pharmacological and genetic manipulations of the SV cycle at the Drosophila NMJ. We demonstrate that a resting pool of SVs exists at this synapse that encompasses 30-41% of the total SV pool. Under conditions of endocytic blockade, using a temperature-sensitive dynamin mutation, the resting pool of SVs can be mobilized and released. We present a model for the presence of a resting pool of SVs that does not require molecular specification of a subpopulation of SVs.",2004,"Graeme W Davis, Kira E Poskanzer"
Proteomic analysis of the Drosophila larval hemolymph clot,15466469,10.1074/jbc.M408220200,"Components of the insect clot, an extremely rapid forming and critical part of insect immunity, are just beginning to be identified (1). Here we present a proteomic comparison of larval hemolymph before and after clotting to learn more about this process. This approach was supplemented by the identification of substrates for the enzyme transglutaminase, which plays a role in both vertebrate blood clotting (as factor XIIIa) and hemolymph coagulation in arthropods. Hemolymph proteins present in lower amounts after clotting include CG8502 (a protein with a mucin-type domain and a domain with similarity to cuticular components), CG11313 (a protein with similarity to prophenoloxidase-activating proteases), and two phenoloxidases, lipophorin, a secreted gelsolin, and CG15825, which had previously been isolated from clots (2). Proteins whose levels increase after clotting include a ferritin-subunit and two members of the immunoglobulin family with a high similarity to the small immunoglobulin-like molecules involved in mammalian innate immunity. Our results correlate with findings from another study of coagulation (2) that involved a different experimental approach. Proteomics allows the isolation of novel candidate clotting factors, leading to a more complete picture of clotting.

"Identification and characterization of human HESL, rat Hesl and rainbow trout hesl genes in silico",15375612,,"Activation of Notch signaling pathway leads to nuclear translocation of Notch intracellular domain (NIC), and transcriptional activation of target genes through the interaction between CSL proteins (RBPSUH or RBPSUHL) and NIC. HES1, HES5, HEY1 and HEY2 are Notch target genes. Mammalian HES/HEY family proteins as well as Drosophila Hairy and Enhancer of split are implicated in the cell fate determination. We have previously identified and characterized human HES2, HES3 and HES5 genes. Here, we identified and characterized human HES-like (HESL), rat Fesl, and rainbow trout fesl genes by using bioinformatics. Human HESL gene, located within AC093824.3 genome sequence, was mapped to human chromosome 4q35.1 between ACSL1 and SLC25A4 genes. Rat Fesl gene, located within AC111303.4 genome sequence, was mapped to rat chromosome 16q11. EST BX875070.2 was the representative rainbow trout fesl cDNA. HESL-ACSL1 locus was conserved among human, rat, mouse, and zebrafish genomes. Human HESL (241 aa) showed 92.9% total-amino-acid identity with rat Hesl (240 aa), 92.1% total-amino-acid identity with mouse Hesl (240 aa), and 68.0% total-amino-acid identity with rainbow trout hesl (235 aa).

Irreversible engineering of the multielement-binding antibody 2D12.5 and its complementary ligands,15546207,10.1021/bc049824m,"Engineering the permanent formation of a receptor-ligand complex has a number of potential applications in chemistry and biology, including targeted medical imaging and therapy. Starting from the crystal structure of the rare-earth-DOTA binding antibody 2D12.5 (Corneillie, T. M., Fisher, A. J., and Meares, C. F. (2003) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 125, 15039-15048), we used the site-directed incorporation of cysteine nucleophiles at the periphery of the antibody's binding site, paired with the chemical design of a weakly electrophilic ligand, to produce a receptor-ligand pair that associates efficiently and permanently. Protein residues proximal to the ligand's side chain were identified for engineering cysteine mutants. Fab fragments incorporating a cysteine at position 54, 55, or 56 of the heavy chain (complementarity determining region 2) were designed from the structure and then cloned, expressed in Drosophila S2 cells, and tested for reactivity with mildly electrophilic DOTA-yttrium ligands. All showed permanent binding activity, indicating that there is some tolerance for the location of the reactive mutant on the protein surface near the binding site. The G54C Fab mutant displayed the highest expression levels and permanent binding activity in initial experiments and was produced in high yield for further study. Upon examining the behavior of the G54C mutant with a small set of electrophilic ligands, differences in reactivity were observed which indicated that the substituents near the electrophilic atom can be important determinants of permanent binding. The G54C mutant permanently attaches to Y(3+) complexes of (S)-2-(4-acrylamidobenzyl)-DOTA with a half-time of approximately 13 min at 37 degrees C, making it potentially useful for in vivo pretargeting applications.",2004,"Jeremy P Wong, Todd M Corneillie, Claude F Meares, Paul A Whetstone, Kelvin C Lee"
[Cloning of four members of giant panda Dmrt genes],15478606,,"Sex determining genes Mab-3 of C. elegans and Doublesex of Drosophila contain a common DNA binding motif called DM (Doublesex and Mab-3) domain, both of which regulate similar aspects of sexual development. Human Doublesex-related gene DMRT1 has been identified, which also contains the conserved DM-related DNA-binding domain and plays an essential role in gonadal differentiation. We amplified genomic DNA of the giant panda using the DM degenerate primers and detected two bands, approximately 140 bp and 250 bp. After cloned into T-easy vector and sequenced, four sequences showed high homology with the DM domain. Amino acid sequence of the first clone is 100% identical with the Dmrt1 of human, mouse and pig, hence we named it as pDmrt1. The second clone is 96% identical with human DMRTB1, and the third one 100% with the Dmrt3 of mouse and medaka, which were named as pDmrtb1 and pDmrt3 respectively. The last sequence contains an intron of 116 bp within the DM domain, which encodes an amino acid sequence 100% identical with human DMRTC2, accordingly we named it as pDmrtc2. Based on similarities of amino acid sequences of the DM domain, Dmrt protein sequences from human, mouse and giant panda were included in a phylogenetic tree. They revealed seven distinct subgroups: Dmrt1, Dmrt2, Dmrt3, Dmrt4 (DMRTA1), Dmrt5 (DMRTA2), Dmrt6 (DMRTB1) and Dmrt7 (DMRTC2).

We used resources provided by the genome project to derive a physical map of the region, examine gene density, and estimate the number of potential genes. We also carried out a large-scale genetic screen for lethal mutations in the region. We identified new alleles of the known essential genes and also identified mutations in 21 novel loci. Fourteen complementation groups map proximal to the assembled sequence. We used PCR to map the endpoints of several deficiencies and used the same set of deficiencies to order the essential genes, correlating the genetic and physical map.

Little is currently known about the normal function of SCA8 in neuronal survival or how repeat expansion contributes to neurodegeneration. To investigate the molecular context in which SCA8 operates, we have expressed the human SCA8 noncoding RNA in Drosophila. SCA8 induces late-onset, progressive neurodegeneration in the Drosophila retina. Using this neurodegenerative phenotype as a sensitized background for a genetic modifier screen, we have identified mutations in four genes: staufen, muscle-blind, split ends, and CG3249. All four encode neuronally expressed RNA binding proteins conserved in Drosophila and humans. Although expression of both wild-type and repeat-expanded SCA8 induce neurodegeneration, the strength of interaction with certain modifiers differs between the two SCA8 backgrounds, suggesting that CUG expansions alter associations with specific RNA binding proteins. Our demonstration that SCA8 can recruit Staufen and that the interaction domain maps to the portion of the SCA8 RNA that undergoes repeat expansion in the human disease suggests a specific mechanism for SCA8 function and disease. Genetic modifiers identified in our SCA8-based screens may provide candidates for designing therapeutic interventions to treat this disease.",2004,"Mousumi Mutsuddi, Michael D Koob, Cameron M Marshall, Ilaria Rebay, Kellie A Benzow"
Modes of selection and recombination response in Drosophila melanogaster,14757732,10.1093/jhered/esh016,"A selection experiment for sternopleural bristle number in Drosophila melanogaster was undertaken to analyze the correlated effects on recombination.

Lines selected for both increased and decreased bristle number exhibited significantly increased recombination rates. The predicted recombination response from stabilizing selection is suggested by our data, but only one comparison is statistically significant. These results, taken with other studies, support the proposal that genetic recombination enhances individual fitness when populations are experiencing environmental change. Less conclusively, our results suggest that populations undergoing stabilizing selection may respond by reducing their rates of crossing over.",2004,"D K Keenan, C F Rodell, M R Schipper"
"Characterization of OSR1, a member of the mammalian Ste20p/germinal center kinase subfamily",14707132,10.1074/jbc.M313562200,"In examining the protein kinase components of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase (MAPK) cascades that regulate the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in Drosophila S2 cells, we previously found that distinct upstream kinases were involved in responses to sorbitol and lipopolysaccharide. Here we have extended that analysis to the possible MAPK kinase kinase kinases (MAP4Ks) in the JNK pathway. Fray, a putative Drosophila MAP4K, provided a major contribution to JNK activation by sorbitol. To explore the possible link to JNK in mammalian cells, we isolated and characterized OSR1 (oxidative stress-responsive 1), one of two human Fray homologs. OSR1 is a 58-kDa protein of 527 amino acids that is widely expressed in mammalian tissues and cell lines. Of potential regulators surveyed, endogenous OSR1 is activated only by osmotic stresses, notably sorbitol and to a lesser extent NaCl. However, OSR1 did not increase the activity of coexpressed JNK, nor did it activate three other MAPKs, p38, ERK2, and ERK5. A two-hybrid screen implicated another Ste20p family member, the p21-activated protein kinase PAK1, as an OSR1 target. OSR1 phosphorylated threonine 84 in the N-terminal regulatory domain of PAK1. Replacement of threonine 84 with glutamate reduced the activation of PAK1 by an active form of the small G protein Cdc42, suggesting that phosphorylation by OSR1 modulates the G protein sensitivity of PAK isoforms.",2004,"Wei Chen, Mustafa Yazicioglu, Melanie H Cobb"

However, the mechanism of specific localization is not known. We have studied the DNA binding of DmORC to investigate the cis-requirements for DmORC:DNA interaction. DmORC displays at best six-fold differences in the relative affinities to DNA from the third chorion locus and to random fragments in vitro, and chemical probing and DNase1 protection experiments did not identify a discrete binding site for DmORC on any of these fragments. The intrinsic DNA-binding specificity of DmORC is therefore insufficient to target DmORC to origins of replication in vivo. However, the topological state of the DNA significantly influences the affinity of DmORC to DNA. We found that the affinity of DmORC for negatively supercoiled DNA is about 30-fold higher than for either relaxed or linear DNA. These data provide biochemical evidence for the notion that origin specification in metazoa likely involves mechanisms other than simple replicator-initiator interactions and that in vivo other proteins must determine ORC's localization.",2004,"Dirk Remus, Michael R Botchan, Eileen L Beall"
Interaction between the GAGA factor and Mod(mdg4) proteins promotes insulator bypass in Drosophila,15465920,10.1073/pnas.0403959101,"Chromatin insulators or boundaries are proposed to structure the chromatin fiber into functionally independent domains by promoting the formation of chromatin loops. These elements can block the communication between an enhancer and a gene when placed between them. Interestingly, it has been previously observed that two tandem copies of the Drosophila Su(Hw) insulator abolish this enhancer-blocking activity, presumably through pairing. This bypass effect has not been described with other insulators, however. In this report, we show that the insertion of binding sites for the GAGA factor (GAF) between an enhancer and the Su(Hw) insulator allows bypassing of the insulator. This bypass relies on the activity of both the GAF protein and the Mod(mdg4)-67.2 protein, a factor required for Su(Hw) insulator activity. We show that these two proteins interact in vitro and in vivo, providing molecular evidence of pairing between the GAF sites and the Su(Hw) insulator. Finally, we show that placing the Mcp boundary together with the Su(Hw) insulator between an enhancer and a promoter leads to bypass, again in a GAF- and Mod(mdg4)-dependent manner. Our data provide direct evidence that heterologous insulators can be bypassed by distal enhancers and identify the interaction between GAF and Mod(mdg4) as a possible means to regulate insulator activity.",2004,"Giacomo Cavalli, Natalia Gruzdeva, Larisa Melnikova, Pavel Georgiev, Aleksandr Mazur, François Juge"
Intra-membrane ligand diffusion and cell shape modulate juxtacrine patterning,15276004,10.1016/j.jtbi.2004.04.024,"A key problem in developmental biology is how pattern and planar polarity are transmitted in epithelial structures. Examples include Drosophila neuronal differentiation, ommatidia formation in the compound eye, and wing hair polarization. A key component for the generation of such patterns is direct cell-cell signalling by transmembrane ligands, called juxtacrine signalling. Previous models for this mode of communication have considered homogeneous distributions in the cell membrane, and the role of polarity has been largely ignored. In this paper we determine the role of inhomogeneous protein and receptor distributions in juxtacrine signalling. We explicitly include individual membrane segments, diffusive transport of proteins and receptors between these segments, and production terms with a combination of local and global responses to ligand binding. Our analysis shows that intra-membrane ligand transport is vital for the generation of long wavelength patterns. Moreover, with no ligand transport, there is no pattern formation for lateral induction, a process in which receptor activation up-regulates ligand production. Biased production of ligand also modulates patterning bifurcations and predicted wavelengths. In addition, biased ligand and receptor trafficking can lead to regular polarity across a lattice, in which each cell has the same orientation-directly analogous to patterns of hairs in the Drosophila wing. We confirm the trends in pattern wavelengths previously observed for patterns with cellular homogeneity-lateral inhibition tends to give short-range patterns, while lateral induction can give patterns with much longer wavelengths. Moreover, the original model can be recovered if intra-membrane bound receptor diffusion is included and rapid equilibriation between the sides is considered. Finally, we consider the role of irregular cell shapes and waves in such networks, including wave propagation past clones of non-signalling cells.",2004,"Markus R Owen, Steven D Webb"

We will compare and contrast these findings with those obtained in other organisms, in particular zebrafish and mice.

Although previous reports have demonstrated that the RING domain is important for the anti-apoptotic function of Op-IAP3, the function of this domain in Op-IAP3 has not been studied. Here, the ability of Op-IAP3 to function as an E3 ubiquitin protein ligase was examined. Op-IAP3 expressed in the insect cell line Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf21) was ubiquitinated, but only if the RING domain was intact. In addition, co-expression of Op-IAP3 and the pro-apoptotic Drosophila protein HID resulted in the ubiquitination of HID. Recombinant Op-IAP3 protein also promoted the ubiquitination of both itself and recombinant HID protein in vitro, and the ubiquitination of HID required both the RING and BIR2 of Op-IAP3.

Actin/alpha-actinin-dependent transport of AMPA receptors in dendritic spines: role of the PDZ-LIM protein RIL,15456832,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2100-04.2004,"The efficacy of excitatory transmission in the brain depends to a large extent on synaptic AMPA receptors, hence the importance of understanding the delivery and recycling of the receptors at the synaptic sites. Here we report a novel regulation of the AMPA receptor transport by a PDZ (postsynaptic density-95/Drosophila disc large tumor suppressor zona occludens 1) and LIM (Lin11/rat Isl-1/Mec3) domain-containing protein, RIL (reversion-induced LIM protein). We show that RIL binds to the AMPA glutamate receptor subunit GluR-A C-terminal peptide via its LIM domain and to alpha-actinin via its PDZ domain. RIL is enriched in the postsynaptic density fraction isolated from rat forebrain, strongly localizes to dendritic spines in cultured neurons, and coprecipitates, together with alpha-actinin, in a protein complex isolated by immunoprecipitation of AMPA receptors from forebrain synaptosomes. Functionally, in heterologous cells, RIL links AMPA receptors to the alpha-actinin/actin cytoskeleton, an effect that appears to apply selectively to the endosomal surface-internalized population of the receptors. In cultured neurons, an overexpression of recombinant RIL increases the accumulation of AMPA receptors in dendritic spines, both at the total level, as assessed by immunodetection of endogenous GluR-A-containing receptors, and at the synaptic surface, as assessed by recording of miniature EPSCs. Our results thus indicate that RIL directs the transport of GluR-A-containing AMPA receptors to and/or within dendritic spines, in an alpha-actinin/actin-dependent manner, and that such trafficking function promotes the synaptic accumulation of the receptors.",2004,"Morgan Sheng, Verena Pawlak, Andrei Rozov, Jinhyun Kim, Tanjew Dittgen, Alexander Kolleker, Peter H Seeburg, Georg Köhr, Terunaga Nakagawa, Pavel Osten, Torsten W Schulz, Pawel Licznerski"
Troponin I is required for myofibrillogenesis and sarcomere formation in Drosophila flight muscle,15075240,10.1242/jcs.01024,"Myofibrillar proteins assemble to form the highly ordered repetitive contractile structural unit known as a sarcomere. Studies of myogenesis in vertebrate cell culture and embryonic developmental systems have identified some of the processes involved during sarcomere formation. However, isoform changes during vertebrate muscle development and a lack of mutants have made it difficult to determine how these proteins assemble to form sarcomeres. The indirect flight muscles (IFMs) of Drosophila provide a unique genetic system with which to study myofibrillogenesis in vivo. We show in this paper that neither sarcomeric myosin nor actin are required for myoblast fusion or the subsequent morphogenesis of muscle fibres, i.e. fibre morphogenesis does not depend on myofibrillogenesis. However, fibre formation and myofibrillogenesis are very sensitive to the interactions between the sarcomeric proteins. A troponin I (TnI) mutation, hdp(3), leads to an absence of TnI in the IFMs and tergal depressor of trochanter (TDT) muscles due to a transcript-splicing defect. Sarcomeres do not form and the muscles degenerate. TnI is part of the thin filament troponin complex which regulates muscle contraction. The effects of the hdp(3) mutation are probably caused by unregulated acto-myosin interactions between the thin and thick filaments as they assemble. We have tested this proposal by using a transgenic myosin construct to remove the force-producing myosin heads. The defects in sarcomeric organisation and fibre degeneration in hdp(3) IFMs are suppressed, although not completely, indicating the need for inhibition of muscle contraction during muscle development. We show that mRNA and translated protein products of all the major thin filament proteins are reduced in hdp(3) muscles and discuss how this and previous studies of thin filament protein mutants indicate a common co-ordinated control mechanism that may be the primary cause of the muscle defects.",2004,"Maqsood Ansari, Sam Clark, Mark Cummins, John C Sparrow, Upendra Nongthomba, Meg Stark"

Here we have used tandem mass spectrometry to identify major components of the hScrib network. We show that it includes betaPIX (also called Cool-1), a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), and its partner GIT1 (also called p95-APP1), a GTPase activating protein (GAP). betaPIX directly binds to the hScrib PDZ domains, and the hScrib/betaPIX complex is efficiently recovered in epithelial and neuronal cells and tissues. In cerebellar granule cell cultures, hScrib and betaPIX are both partially localized at neuronal presynaptic compartments. Furthermore, we show that hScrib is required to anchor betaPIX at the cell cortex and that dominant-negative betaPIX or hScrib proteins can each inhibit Ca2+-dependent exocytosis in neuroendocrine PC12 cells, demonstrating a functional relationship between these proteins.

Genetic models of mechanotransduction: the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans,15383649,10.1152/physrev.00043.2003,"Mechanotransduction, the conversion of a mechanical stimulus into a biological response, constitutes the basis for a plethora of fundamental biological processes such as the senses of touch, balance, and hearing and contributes critically to development and homeostasis in all organisms. Despite this profound importance in biology, we know remarkably little about how mechanical input forces delivered to a cell are interpreted to an extensive repertoire of output physiological responses. Recent, elegant genetic and electrophysiological studies have shown that specialized macromolecular complexes, encompassing mechanically gated ion channels, play a central role in the transformation of mechanical forces into a cellular signal, which takes place in mechanosensory organs of diverse organisms. These complexes are highly efficient sensors, closely entangled with their surrounding environment. Such association appears essential for proper channel gating and provides proximity of the mechanosensory apparatus to the source of triggering mechanical energy. Genetic and molecular evidence collected in model organisms such as the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, and the mouse highlight two distinct classes of mechanically gated ion channels: the degenerin (DEG)/epithelial Na(+) channel (ENaC) family and the transient receptor potential (TRP) family of ion channels. In addition to the core channel proteins, several other potentially interacting molecules have in some cases been identified, which are likely parts of the mechanotransducing apparatus. Based on cumulative data, a model of the sensory mechanotransducer has emerged that encompasses our current understanding of the process and fulfills the structural requirements dictated by its dedicated function. It remains to be seen how general this model is and whether it will withstand the impiteous test of time.",2004,"Popi Syntichaki, Nektarios Tavernarakis"
"Hrp48, a Drosophila hnRNPA/B homolog, binds and regulates translation of oskar mRNA",15130489,10.1016/s1534-5807(04)00132-7,"Establishment of the Drosophila embryonic axes provides a striking example of RNA localization as an efficient mechanism for protein targeting within a cell. oskar mRNA encodes the posterior determinant and is essential for germline and abdominal development in the embryo. Tight restriction of Oskar activity to the posterior is achieved by mRNA localization-dependent translational control, whereby unlocalized mRNA is translationally repressed and repression is overcome upon mRNA localization. Here we identify the previously reported oskar RNA binding protein p50 as Hrp48, an abundant Drosophila hnRNP. Analysis of three hrp48 mutant alleles reveals that Hrp48 levels are crucial for polarization of the oocyte during mid-oogenesis. Our data also show that Hrp48, which binds to the 5' and 3' regions of oskar mRNA, plays an important role in restricting Oskar activity to the posterior of the oocyte, by repressing oskar mRNA translation during transport.",2004,"Andrej Shevchenko, Anne Ephrussi, Sonia López de Quinto, Tamaki Yano, Anna Shevchenko, Yasuhisa Matsui"
Loss of poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase causes progressive neurodegeneration in Drosophila melanogaster,14676324,10.1073/pnas.2237114100,"Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation has been suggested to be involved in regulation of DNA repair, transcription, centrosome duplication, and chromosome stability. However, the regulation of degradation of poly(ADP-ribose) and its significance are not well understood. Here we report a loss-of-function mutant Drosophila with regard to poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase, a major hydrolyzing enzyme of poly(ADP-ribose). The mutant lacks the conserved catalytic domain of poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase, and exhibits lethality in the larval stages at the normal development temperature of 25 degrees C. However, one-fourth of the mutants progress to the adult stage at 29 degrees C but showed progressive neurodegeneration with reduced locomotor activity and a short lifespan. In association with this, extensive accumulation of poly(ADP-ribose) could be detected in the central nervous system. These results suggest that poly(ADP-ribose) metabolism is required for maintenance of the normal function of neuronal cells. The phenotypes observed in the parg mutant might be useful to understand neurodegenerative conditions such as the Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases that are caused by abnormal accumulation of substances in nervous tissue.",2004,"Mitsunori Yamada, Sayaka Ohashi, Hitoshi Takahashi, Keiji Okamoto, Shuji Hanai, Masayuki Kanai, Masanao Miwa"
Deneddylase 1 regulates deneddylase activity of the Cop9 signalosome in Drosophila melanogaster,26332639,10.1111/1744-7917.12274,"NEDD8 conjugation of Cullin has an important role in ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation. The COP9 signalosome, of which CSN5 is the major catalytic subunit, is a major Cullin deneddylase. Another deneddylase, Deneddylase 1, has also been shown to process the Nedd8 precursor. In Drosophila, the DEN1 mutants do not have increased levels of Cullin neddylation, but instead show a significant decrease in neddylated Cullin. This characteristic decrease in neddylated Cullins in the DEN1null background can be rescued by UAS-dDEN1WT overexpression but not by overexpression of mature NEDD8, indicating that this phenotype is distinct from the NEDD8-processing function of DEN1. We examined the role of DEN1-CSN interaction in regulating Cullin neddylation. Overexpression of DEN1 in a CSN5hypo background slightly reduced unneddylated Cullin levels. The CSN5, DEN1 double mutation partially rescues the premature lethality associated with the CSN5 single mutation. These results suggest that DEN1 regulates Cullin neddylation by suppressing CSN deneddylase activity.",2017,"Jeongbin Yim, Hyung-Jun Kim, Kiyoung Kim, Jeongsook Yoon"
Idiothetic Path Integration in the Fruit Fly Drosophila melanogaster,28736164,10.1016/j.cub.2017.06.026,"After discovering a small drop of food, hungry flies exhibit a peculiar behavior in which they repeatedly stray from, but then return to, the newly discovered resource. To study this behavior in more detail, we tracked hungry Drosophila as they explored a large arena, focusing on the question of how flies remain near the food. To determine whether flies use external stimuli, we individually eliminated visual, olfactory, and pheromonal cues. In all cases, flies still exhibited a centralized search behavior, suggesting that none of these cues are absolutely required for navigation back to the food. To simultaneously eliminate visual and olfactory cues associated with the position of the food, we constructed an apparatus in which the food could be rapidly translated from the center of the arena. Flies continued to search around the original location, even after the food was moved to a new position. A random search model based on measured locomotor statistics could not reproduce the centered nature of the animal's trajectory. We conclude that this behavior is best explained by a form of path integration in which the flies use idiothetic cues to search near the location of the food. We argue that the use of path integration to perform a centered local search is not a specialization of Drosophila but rather represents an ancient behavioral mode that is homologous to the more elaborate foraging strategies of central place foragers such as ants.",2017,"Michael H Dickinson, Irene S Kim"
Drosophila: An Emergent Model for Delineating Interactions between the Circadian Clock and Drugs of Abuse,29391952,10.1155/2017/4723836,"Endogenous circadian oscillators orchestrate rhythms at the cellular, physiological, and behavioral levels across species to coordinate activity, for example, sleep/wake cycles, metabolism, and learning and memory, with predictable environmental cycles.

The circadian clock modulates alcohol- and drug-induced behaviors with circadian misalignment contributing to increased substance use and abuse. Invertebrate models, such as Drosophila melanogaster, have proven invaluable for the identification of genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying highly conserved processes including the circadian clock, drug tolerance, and reward systems. In this review, we highlight the contributions of Drosophila as a model system for understanding the bidirectional interactions between the circadian system and the drugs of abuse, alcohol and cocaine, and illustrate the highly conserved nature of these interactions between Drosophila and mammalian systems.

The Functional Amyloid Orb2A Binds to Lipid Membranes,28700922,10.1016/j.bpj.2017.05.039,"Lipid membranes interact with and influence the aggregation of many amyloid-forming proteins. Orb2 is a cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein homolog in Drosophila melanogaster that forms functional amyloids necessary for long-term memory. One isoform, Orb2A, has a unique N-terminus that has been shown to be important for the formation of amyloid-like aggregates and long-term memory in vivo. Orb2A is also found enriched in the synaptic membrane fraction. Our sequence and hydropathy analysis suggests that it can form an amphipathic helix, which is ideal for lipid membrane interaction. We used circular dichroism and site-directed spin labeling coupled with electron paramagnetic resonance to test the first 88 amino acids of Orb2A for lipid interaction. We show that Orb2A1-88 interacts with anionic lipid membranes using an amphipathic helix at its unique N-terminus. This interaction depends on the charge of the lipid membrane and the degree of membrane curvature. We used transmission electron microscopy and electron paramagnetic resonance to show that the presence of anionic small unilamellar vesicles inhibits amyloid fibril formation by Orb2A.

Use of the CRISPR-Cas9 system for genome editing in cultured Drosophila ovarian somatic cells,28552546,10.1016/j.ymeth.2017.05.021,"The CRISPR-Cas9 system can be used for genome engineering in many organisms.

However, the germline-specific piRNA amplification system known as the ping-pong machinery does not occur in OSCs, making them unsuitable for elucidating the underlying mechanisms. Mutations in the lethal (3) malignant brain tumor gene (l(3)mbt) have been shown to cause ectopic expression of germline genes, including ping-pong factors.

Analysis of transient hypermorphic activity of E(spl)D during R8 specification,29036187,10.1371/journal.pone.0186439,"Drosophila atonal (ato) is required for the specification of founding R8 photoreceptors during retinal development. ato is regulated via dual eye-specific enhancers; ato-3' is subject to initial induction whereas 5'-ato facilitates Notch-mediated autoregulation. Notch is further utilized to induce bHLH repressors of the E(spl) locus to restrict Ato from its initial broad expression to individual cells. Although Notch operates in two, distinct phases, it has remained unclear how the two phases maintain independence from one another. The difference in these two phases has attributed to the hypothesized delayed expression of E(spl). However, immunofluorescence data indicate that E(spl) are expressed during early Ato patterning, suggesting a more sophisticated underlying mechanism. To probe this mechanism, we provide evidence that although E(spl) exert no influence on ato-3', E(spl) repress 5'-ato and deletion of the E(spl) locus elicits precocious 5'-ato activity. Thus, E(spl) imposes a delay to the timing in which Ato initiates autoregulation. We next sought to understand this finding in the context of E(spl)D, which encodes a dysregulated variant of E(spl)M8 that perturbs R8 patterning, though, as previously reported, only in conjunction with the mutant receptor Nspl. We established a genetic interaction between E(spl)D and roughened eye (roe), a known modulator of Notch signaling in retinogenesis. This link further suggests a dosage-dependence between E(spl) and the proneural activators Ato and Sens, as indicated via interaction assays in which E(spl)D renders aberrant R8 patterning in conjunction with reduced proneural dosage. In total, the biphasicity of Notch signaling relies, to some degree, on the post-translational regulation of individual E(spl) members and, importantly, that post-translational regulation is likely necessary to modulate the level of E(spl) activity throughout the progression of Ato expression.",2017,"Adam T Majot, Ashok P Bidwai"
Temporal calcium profiling of specific circadian neurons in freely moving flies,28973886,10.1073/pnas.1706608114,"There are no general methods for reliably assessing the firing properties or even calcium profiles of specific neurons in freely moving flies.

This Tric-LUC reporter allowed a direct comparison of luciferase activity with locomotor activity, which was assayed in the same flies with video recording. The LUC profile from activity-promoting E cells paralleled evening locomotor activity, and the LUC profile from sleep-promoting glutamatergic DN1s (gDN1s) paralleled daytime sleep. Similar profiles were generated by novel reporters recently identified based on transcription factor activation. As E cell and gDN1 activity is necessary and sufficient for normal evening locomotor activity and daytime sleep profiles, respectively, we suggest that their luciferase profiles reflect their neuronal calcium and in some cases firing profiles in wake-behaving flies.",2017,"Michael Rosbash, Fang Guo, Xiao Chen"
A genetically encoded biosensor for visualising hypoxia responses in vivo,28011628,10.1242/bio.018226,"Cells experience different oxygen concentrations depending on location, organismal developmental stage, and physiological or pathological conditions. Responses to reduced oxygen levels (hypoxia) rely on the conserved hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1).

To visualise and analyse HIF-1 dynamics in Drosophila, we used a hypoxia biosensor consisting of GFP fused to the oxygen-dependent degradation domain (ODD) of the HIF-1 homologue Sima. GFP-ODD responds to changing oxygen levels and to genetic manipulations of the hypoxia pathway, reflecting oxygen-dependent regulation of HIF-1 at the single-cell level. Ratiometric imaging of GFP-ODD and a red-fluorescent reference protein reveals tissue-specific differences in the cellular hypoxic status at ambient normoxia. Strikingly, cells in the larval brain show distinct hypoxic states that correlate with the distribution and relative densities of respiratory tubes.

A variety of experimental systems have shown that neurons are sensitive to TDP-43 expression levels, yet the specific functional defects resulting from TDP-43 dysregulation have not been well described. Using the Drosophila TDP-43 ortholog TBPH, we previously showed that TBPH-null animals display locomotion defects as third instar larvae. Furthermore, loss of TBPH caused a reduction in cacophony, a Type II voltage-gated calcium channel, expression and that genetically restoring cacophony in motor neurons in TBPH mutant animals was sufficient to rescue the locomotion defects. In the present study, we examined the relative contributions of neuromuscular junction physiology and the motor program to the locomotion defects and identified subsets of neurons that require cacophony expression to rescue the defects. At the neuromuscular junction, we showed mEPP amplitudes and frequency require TBPH. Cacophony expression in motor neurons rescued mEPP frequency but not mEPP amplitude. We also showed that TBPH mutants displayed reduced motor neuron bursting and coordination during crawling and restoring cacophony selectively in two pairs of cells located in the brain, the AVM001b/2b neurons, also rescued the locomotion and motor defects, but not the defects in neuromuscular junction physiology. These results suggest that the behavioral defects associated with loss of TBPH throughout the nervous system can be associated with defects in a small number of genes in a limited number of central neurons, rather than peripheral defects.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT TDP-43 dysfunction is a common feature in neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal lobar dementia, and Alzheimer's disease. Loss- and gain-of-function models have shown that neurons are sensitive to TDP-43 expression levels, but the specific defects caused by TDP-43 loss of function have not been described in detail. A Drosophila loss-of-function model displays pronounced locomotion defects that can be reversed by restoring the expression levels of a voltage-gated calcium channel, cacophony. We show these defects can be rescued by expression of cacophony in motor neurons and by expression in two pairs of neurons in the brain. These data suggest that loss of TDP-43 can disrupt the central circuitry of the CNS, opening up identification of alternative therapeutic targets for TDP-43 proteinopathies.",2017,"Charles Scudder, Kayly M Lembke, David B Morton"
Changes in Neuronal Signaling and Cell Stress Response Pathways are Associated with a Multigenic Response of Drosophila melanogaster to DDT Selection,29211847,10.1093/gbe/evx252,"The adaptation of insect populations to insecticidal control is a continual threat to human health and sustainable agricultural practices, but many complex genomic mechanisms involved in this adaption remain poorly understood. This study applied a systems approach to investigate the interconnections between structural and functional variance in response to dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) within the Drosophila melanogaster strain 91-R. Directional selection in 6 selective sweeps coincided with constitutive gene expression differences in DDT resistant flies, including the most highly upregulated transcript, Unc-115 b, which plays a central role in axon guidance, and the most highly downregulated transcript, the angiopoietin-like CG31832, which is involved in directing vascular branching and dendrite outgrowth but likely may be under trans-regulatory control. Direct functions and protein-protein interactions mediated by differentially expressed transcripts control changes in cell migration, signal transduction, and gene regulatory cascades that impact the nervous system. Although changes to cellular stress response pathways involve 8 different cytochrome P450s, stress response, and apoptosis is controlled by a multifacetted regulatory mechanism. These data demonstrate that DDT selection in 91-R may have resulted in genome-wide adaptations that impacts genetic and signal transduction pathways that converge to modify stress response, cell survival, and neurological functions. This study implicates the involvement of a multigenic mechanism in the adaptation to a chemical insecticide, which impact interconnected regulatory cascades. We propose that DDT selection within 91-R might act systemically, wherein pathway interactions function to reinforce the epistatic effects of individual adaptive changes on an additive or nonadditive basis.",2017,"John M Clark, Keon Mook Seong, Barry R Pittendrigh, Weilin Sun, Brad S Coates"
A new mode of DNA binding distinguishes Capicua from other HMG-box factors and explains its mutation patterns in cancer,28278156,10.1371/journal.pgen.1006622,"HMG-box proteins, including Sox/SRY (Sox) and TCF/LEF1 (TCF) family members, bind DNA via their HMG-box. This binding, however, is relatively weak and both Sox and TCF factors employ distinct mechanisms for enhancing their affinity and specificity for DNA. Here we report that Capicua (CIC), an HMG-box transcriptional repressor involved in Ras/MAPK signaling and cancer progression, employs an additional distinct mode of DNA binding that enables selective recognition of its targets. We find that, contrary to previous assumptions, the HMG-box of CIC does not bind DNA alone but instead requires a distant motif (referred to as C1) present at the C-terminus of all CIC proteins. The HMG-box and C1 domains are both necessary for binding specific TGAATGAA-like sites, do not function via dimerization, and are active in the absence of cofactors, suggesting that they form a bipartite structure for sequence-specific binding to DNA. We demonstrate that this binding mechanism operates throughout Drosophila development and in human cells, ensuring specific regulation of multiple CIC targets. It thus appears that HMG-box proteins generally depend on auxiliary DNA binding mechanisms for regulating their appropriate genomic targets, but that each sub-family has evolved unique strategies for this purpose. Finally, the key role of C1 in DNA binding also explains the fact that this domain is a hotspot for inactivating mutations in oligodendroglioma and other tumors, while being preserved in oncogenic CIC-DUX4 fusion chimeras associated to Ewing-like sarcomas.",2017,"Marta Forés, Núria Samper, Leiore Ajuria, Gerardo Jiménez, Lucía Simón-Carrasco, Mariano Barbacid, Matthias Drosten, Sergio González-Crespo"

The cellular recognition mechanisms regulating the selection of synaptic partners are poorly understood. As final mediators of cell-cell interactions, cell surface and secreted molecules (CSMs) are expected to play important roles in this process.

Our sequencing data revealed that each one of these neurons expresses a unique combination of hundreds of CSMs at the onset of synapse formation. We show that 21 paralogs of the defective proboscis extension response (Dpr) family are expressed in a unique cell-type-specific fashion, consistent with the distinct connectivity pattern of each neuron profiled. Expression analysis of their cognate binding partners, the 9 members of the Dpr interacting protein (DIP) family, revealed complementary layer-specific expression in the medulla, suggestive of interactions between neurons expressing Dpr and those expressing DIP in the same layer. Through coexpression analysis and correlation to connectome data, we identify neurons expressing DIP as a subset of the synaptic partners of the neurons expressing Dpr.

Drosophila mutants lacking octopamine exhibit impairment in aversive olfactory associative learning,28715094,10.1111/ejn.13654,"Octopamine is a biogenic amine in invertebrates that is considered a functional homolog of vertebrate norepinephrine, acting as a neurotransmitter, neuromodulator and neurohormone. Octopamine regulates many physiological processes such as metabolism, reproduction and different types of behaviour including learning and memory. Previous studies in insects led to the notion that acquisition of an olfactory memory depends on the octopaminergic system during appetitive (reward-based) learning, but not in the case of aversive (punishment-based) learning. Here, we provide several lines of evidence demonstrating that aversive associative olfactory learning in Drosophila is also dependent on octopamine signalling. Specifically, we used Drosophila Tβh (tyramine-β-hydroxylase) mutants, which lack octopamine and are female sterile, to determine whether octopamine plays a role in aversive learning. We show that Tβh mutant flies exhibit a significant reduction in learning compared to control lines that is independent of either genetic background or the methods used to induce aversive olfactory memory. We also show that the learning deficits observed in Tβh mutants are not due to defects in sensorimotor behaviours. Finally, to unambiguously demonstrate that octopamine synthesis plays a role in aversive olfactory learning, we performed rescue experiments using the Gal4/UAS system. We show that expression of UAS-Tβh in octopamine/tyraminergic neurons using Tdc2-Gal4 in Tβh null mutant flies fully rescued both the aversive learning defects and female sterility observed in Tβh mutants.",2017,"Natalia Iliadi, Konstantin G Iliadi, Gabrielle L Boulianne"

It occupies an important status in genus Drosophila due to its certain genetic peculiarities like spontaneous male meiotic crossing over, varied chromosomal polymorphism, Y-4 linkage of nucleolus organizer etc. and therefore, it seemed appropriate to investigate population structure and genetic differentiation among its natural populations. We assayed allozyme variation among 15 natural Indian populations of D. ananassae to evaluate its population structure and genetic differentiation. To test genetic differentiation between the populations, pairwise FST values were calculated and the results obtained clearly showed that Indian populations of D. ananassae are not homogeneous and exhibit moderate level of genetic differentiation.

Distinct modes of cyclin E/cdc2c kinase regulation and S-phase control in mitotic and endoreduplication cycles of Drosophila embryogenesis,7797073,10.1101/gad.9.11.1327,"Drosophila cyclin E (DmcycE) is required in embryos for S phase of mitotic and endoreduplication cycles. Here, we describe regulatory differences characteristic for these two cell cycle types. While DmcycE transcript levels decline in DmcycE mutant cells programmed for mitotic proliferation, they are maintained and no longer restricted to transient pulses in DmcycE mutant cells programmed for endoreduplication. Moreover, DmcycE expression in endoreduplicating cells is down-regulated by ectopic expression of a heat-inducible cyclin E transgene. DmcycE expression in endoreduplicating tissues, therefore, is restricted by a negative feedback to the transient pulse triggering entry into S-phase. Conversely, during mitotic cycles, where S phase entry is not only dependent on cyclin E but also on progression through M phase, cyclin E and associated Dmcdc2c kinase activity are present throughout the cell cycle. Reinitiation of DNA replication during the G2 phase of the mitotic cell cycle, therefore, is prevented by cyclin E/Dmcdc2c kinase-independent regulation. Observations in cyclin A mutants implicate G2 cyclins in this regulation. Our results suggest molecular explanations for the different rules governing S phase during mitotic and endoreduplication cycles.",1995,"J A Knoblich, K Sauer, H Richardson, C F Lehner"
Structure and regulation of the fushi tarazu gene from Drosophila hydei,28306077,10.1007/BF00357762,"The Drosophila melanogaster segmentation gene fushi tarazu (ftz) encodes a homeodomain-type transcription factor involved in the control of larval pattern formation. Loss of function mutations cause an embryonic lethal, pair-rule phenotype. The segmentation defects, but not the lethality, can be partially rescued by the ftz orthologue from Drosophila hydei. In this work, the primary structure, expression and regulation of the D. hydei ftz gene was characterized. Sequence comparisons classify ftz as a rather fast evolving gene. However, since the homeodomain of the D. hydei FTZ protein is highly similar to that of D. melanogaster, proper regulation of D. melanogaster ftz downstream genes would be expected. In D. melanogaster embryos, a D. hydei ftz transgene is expressed normally, independent of endogenous ftz gene activity, suggesting that D. hydei ftz regulatory sequences are correctly recognized by D. melanogaster transcription factors. Accordingly, lacZ fusion constructs driven by the D. hydei ftz upstream element are expressed normally in D. melanogaster embryos. Altogether, the similarities between the two ftz orthologues by far outweigh the differences. The limited success of the trans-species rescue might be, therefore, a consequence of the accumulation of too many subtle changes in gene function, exceeding the limits of developmental plasticity during fly embryogenesis.",1995,"Dieter Maier, Leslie Pick, Anette Preiss, Wolfgang Jost, Yan Yu"
Nonclassical behavior of the thymus leukemia antigen: peptide transporter-independent expression of a nonclassical class I molecule,7699328,10.1084/jem.181.4.1433,"The thymus leukemia (TL) antigen is a major histocompatibility complex-encoded nonclassical class I molecule. Here we present data demonstrating that expression of the TL antigen, unlike other class I molecules, is completely independent of the function of the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP). The TL antigen is expressed by transfected TAP-2-deficient RMA-S cells when these cells are grown at 37 degrees C. In transfected RMA cells, the kinetics of arrival of TL antigen on the cell surface are similar to those of a classical class I molecule. The kinetics are not altered in TAP-deficient RMA-S cells, demonstrating that surface TL expression in TAP-deficient cells is not due to the stable expression of a few molecules that leak out by a TAP-independent pathway. Soluble TL molecules produced by Drosophila melanogaster cells are highly resistant to thermal denaturation, unlike peptide-free classical class I molecules synthesized by these insect cells. In addition, these soluble TL molecules are devoid of detectable bound peptides. The results demonstrate that the TL antigen is capable of reaching the surface without bound peptide, although acquisition of peptide or some other ligand through a TAP-independent pathway cannot be formally excluded. We speculate that the ability of the TL antigen to reach the cell surface, under conditions in which other class I molecules do not, may be related to a specialized function of the TL molecule in the mucosal immune system, and possibly in the stimulation of intestinal gamma delta T cells.",1995,"M Teitell, J K Maher, P A Peterson, M Kronenberg, H R Holcombe, A R Castaño, H Cheroutre"
Organization of Wolbachia pipientis in the Drosophila fertilized egg and embryo revealed by an anti-Wolbachia monoclonal antibody,7547474,10.1016/0925-4773(95)00372-x,"Cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) in Drosophila is related to the presence of Wolbachia, an intracellular microorganism found in many species of insects. In order to study the intracellular localization of Wolbachia in eggs and embryos, we have purified the bacteria from fly embryos and subsequently generated a monoclonal antibody (Mab Wol-1) specific for Wolbachia. Indirect immunofluorescence staining using Wol-1 reveals that during mitosis, Wolbachia are localized near spindle poles and centrosomes. Double label immunofluorescence experiments using anti-tubulin and anti-Wolbachia antibodies show that Wolbachia co-localize with centrosomal microtubules throughout the cell cycle. Direct interactions between the bacteria and centrosome-organized microtubules are implied from seven observations: (1) throughout the mitotic cycle, the position and movement of Wolbachia precisely mimic the behavior of the centrosome and apparently associated with centrosome-organized microtubules; (2) Wolbachia segregate equally to each spindle pole during mitosis; (3) Wolbachia do not associate with spindle microtubules during mitosis; (4) Wolbachia located in the egg cortex localize to the domains of cytoplasm organized by microtubules during blastoderm formation; (5) polar body nuclei that lack centrosomes but contain associated microtubules do not contain Wolbachia; (6) Wolbachia no longer associated with yolk nuclei, following differentiation and loss of centrosomes; (7) during pole cell formation, Wolbachia co-localize with the centrosome on the apical side of the nucleus as pole cells form. Quantitative data indicates that no Wolbachia growth occurs during the preblastoderm period even though rapid nuclear, and subsequent cellular, proliferation takes place during this same period. This indicates that Wolbachia are under strict growth regulation by the host suggesting that host factors play a role in regulating growth of Wolbachia in the egg. Further cellular and molecular studies of the extensive, global interactions between host and symbiont observed in this egg should provide important new insights into the evolution of host/symbiosis and the cell biology of cytoplasmic incompatibility.",1995,"T L Karr, H Kose"
P-element mutations affecting embryonic peripheral nervous system development in Drosophila melanogaster,7789767,,"The Drosophila embryonic peripheral nervous system (PNS) is an excellent model system to study the molecular mechanisms governing neural development. To identify genes controlling PNS development, we screened 2000 lethal P-element insertion strains. The PNS of mutant embryos was examined using the neural specific marker MAb 22C10, and 92 mutant strains were retained for further analysis. Genetic and cytological analysis of these strains shows that 42 mutations affect previously isolated genes that are known to be required for PNS development: longitudinals lacking (19), mastermind (15), numb (4), big brain (2), and spitz (2). The remaining 50 mutations were classified into 29 complementation groups and the P-element insertions were cytologically mapped. The mutants were classified in five major classes on the basis of their phenotype: gain of neurons, loss of neurons, organizational defects, pathfinding defects and morphological defects. Herein we report the preliminary phenotypic characterization of each of these complementation groups as well as the embryonic lacZ expression pattern of each P-element strain. Our analysis indicates that in most of the P-element insertion strains, the lacZ reporter gene is not expressed in the developing PNS.",1995,"Y He, M Bhat, D D'Evelyn, I Kiss, H J Bellen, A Salzberg, A Kania"
Isolation of timeless by PER protein interaction: defective interaction between timeless protein and long-period mutant PERL,7481773,10.1126/science.270.5237.811,"The period (per) gene likely encodes a component of the Drosophila circadian clock. Circadian oscillations in the abundance of per messenger RNA and per protein (PER) are thought to arise from negative feedback control of per gene transcription by PER. A recently identified second clock locus, timeless (tim), apparently regulates entry of PER into the nucleus. Reported here are the cloning of complementary DNAs derived from the tim gene in a two-hybrid screen for PER-interacting proteins and the demonstration of a physical interaction between the tim protein (TIM) and PER in vitro. A restricted segment of TIM binds directly to a part of the PER dimerization domain PAS. PERL, a mutation that causes a temperature-sensitive lengthening of circadian period and a temperature-sensitive delay in PER nuclear entry, exhibits a temperature-sensitive defect in binding to TIM. These results suggest that the interaction between TIM and PER determines the timing of PER nuclear entry and therefore the duration of part of the circadian cycle.",1995,"N Gekakis, L Saez, A Sehgal, M P Myers, A M Delahaye-Brown, C J Weitz, M W Young"
Distribution of GAGA protein on Drosophila genes in vivo,7744251,10.1101/gad.9.9.1098,"GAGA protein binds specific CT.GA-rich DNA sequences in vitro, and many of these sequences are required for transcription in vivo. GAGA protein has been implicated in the transcription of numerous Drosophila genes, including hsp70, hsp26, actin 5C, and Ubx. Here, we examine the in vivo distribution of GAGA protein on a number of Drosophila genes that do and do not have CT-rich sequences by use of a UV cross-linking technique. Prior to heat shock, GAGA protein is associated with the promoter regions of the uninduced hsp70 and hsp26 genes. Upon heat shock induction, GAGA protein is recruited to their transcription units with its distribution coincident with that of RNA polymerase II. The recruitment of GAGA protein to the hsp70 gene after an instantaneous heat shock occurs in a 5' to 3' manner with kinetics similar to RNA polymerase. GAGA protein has been shown to disrupt nucleosome both in vivo and in vitro. We propose that GAGA protein may function in vivo both by binding constitutively to its high-affinity binding sites and by spreading through the induced gene opening the chromatin structure allowing polymerase to elongate efficiently.",1995,"J T Lis, T O'Brien, C Giardina, R C Wilkins"

Exon skipping by overexpression of a Drosophila heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein in vivo,7892184,10.1073/pnas.92.6.1822,"Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) are abundant RNA-binding proteins that are implicated in splicing regulation. Here we investigate the role of a Drosophila hnRNP in splicing regulation in living animals. We find that overexpression of the Drosophila hnRNP HRB98DE leads to skipping of all internal exons in the Drosophila dopa decarboxylase (Ddc) pre-mRNA in vivo. These results indicate that HRB98DE has a splicing activity that promotes use of terminal splice sites. The effect of excess HRB98DE on Ddc splicing is transient, even though high levels of HRB98DE persist for at least 24 hr. This suggests that Drosophila larvae can induce a compensating mechanism to counteract the effects of excess HRB98DE.",1995,"J Hirsh, A L Beyer, C L Cass, K Zu, J Shen"

DIRECT SELECTION ON LIFE SPAN IN DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER,28565142,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1995.tb02301.x,"An important issue in the study of the evolution of aging in Drosophila melanogaster is whether decreased early fecundity is inextricably coupled with increased life span in selection experiments on age at reproduction. Here, this problem has been tackled using an experimental design in which selection is applied directly to longevity. Selection appeared successful for short and long life, in females as well as males. Progeny production of females selected for long life was lower than for short-lived females throughout their whole life. No increase of late-life reproduction in long-lived females occurred, as has been found in selection experiments on age at reproduction. This discrepancy is explained in terms of the inadequacy of the latter design to separate selection on life span from selection on late-life fecundity. Moreover, starvation resistance and fat content were lower for adults selected for short life. In general, the data support the negative-pleiotropy-disposable-soma theory of aging, and it is hypothesized that the pleiotropic allocation of resources to maintenance versus to reproduction as implicated in the theory might involve lipid metabolism. It is argued that further research on this suggestion is urgent and should certainly comprise observations on male reproduction because these are for the greater part still lacking. In conclusion, the longevity of D. melanogaster can be genetically altered in a direct-selection design, and such an increase is accompanied by a decreased general reproduction and thus early reproduction.",1995,"R Bijlsma, R F Hoekstra, Bas Zwaan"
Solution structure of the pleckstrin homology domain of Drosophila beta-spectrin,8591029,10.1016/s0969-2126(01)00254-4,"Background: The pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which is approximately 100 amino acids long, has been found in about 70 proteins involved in signal transduction and cytoskeletal function, a frequency comparable to SH2 (src homology 2) and SH3 domains. PH domains have been shown to bind the beta gamma-subunits of G-proteins and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). It is conceivable that the PH domain of beta-spectrin plays a part in the association of spectrin with the plasma membrane of cells. Results: We have solved the solution structure of the 122-residue PH domain of Drosophila beta-spectrin. The overall fold consists of two antiparallel beta-sheets packing against each other at an angle of approximately 60 degrees to form a beta-sandwich, a two-turn alpha-helix unique to spectrin PH domains, and a four-turn C-terminal alpha-helix. One of the major insertions in beta-spectrin PH domains forms a long, basic surface loop and appears to undergo slow conformational exchange in solution. This loop shows big spectral changes upon addition of D-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). Conclusions: We propose that the groove at the outer surface of the second beta-sheet is an important site of association with other proteins. This site and the possible lipid-binding site can serve to localize the spectrin network under the plasma membrane. More generally, it has to be considered that the common fold observed for the PH domain structures solved so far does not necessarily mean that all PH domains have similar functions. In fact, the residues constituting potential binding sites for ligands or other proteins are only slightly conserved between different PH domains.",1995,"H Deng, S Talluri, D Branton, P Zhang, G Wagner"
The transposable element mariner can excise in non-drosophilid insects,7500947,10.1007/BF00290372,"Plasmid-based excision assays performed in embryos of two non-drosophilid species using the mariner transposable element from Drosophila mauritiana resulted in empty excision sites identical to those observed after the excision of mariner from D. mauritiana chromosomes. In the presence of the autonomous mariner element Mos1, excision products were recovered from D. melanogaster, D. mauritiana and the blowfly Lucilia cuprina. When a hsp82 heat shock promoter-Mos1 construct was used to supply mariner transposase, excision products were also recovered from the Queensland fruitfly Bactrocera tryoni. Analysis of DNA sequences at empty excision sites led us to hypothesise that the mariner excision/repair process involves the formation of a heteroduplex at the excision breakpoint. The success of these assays suggests that they will provide a valuable tool for assessing the ability of mariner and mariner-like elements to function in non-drosophilid insects and for investigating the basic mechanisms of mariner excision and repair.",1995,"C J Coates, C L Turney, D A O'Brochta, W D Warren, P W Atkinson, M Frommer"
[Molecular-biological approaches to studying gene expression during regeneration],7670351,,"This paper constitutes a review of the methodical approaches allowing analysis of the mechanisms underlying development and differentiation. Progress in investigation of the mechanisms underlying embryogenesis is related to the discovery of genic families in the Drosophila genome, which are responsible for different periods of embryogenesis. The true revolution in studies of developmental mechanisms began with the application of molecular-genetic methods for analysis of Drosophila mutant lines. The clarification and analysis of the genes controlling regeneration is one of the most effective paths toward an understanding of the mechanisms underlying regeneration. No mutations affecting regeneration are, and the development of alternative (i.e., not based on mutation analysis) methods of discovery of the genes controlling regeneration is necessary for investigation of the genetic mechanisms of regeneration. The advantages and drawbacks of the two main approaches for discovery of the genes controlling regeneration are considered. The first approach is based on the production of a bank of sequences expressed in the regenerating structures and subsequent screening of the bank by the known probes. This approach also involves analysis of the structure, function, and expression pattern of the obtained homologs. The second approach is based on subtractive hybridization, which allows identification of the genes specifically expressed in the regenerating structures. This approach was made it possible to identify, for the first time, new genes specifically expressed during lens and retina regeneration in amphibians.",1995,"S L Znoĭko, S A Luk'ianov, V I Mitashov, I Iu Snegovaia, A S Mikaélian, Iu V Markitantova, S M Dolgilevich, O V Kazanskaia"
A family of phosphoinositide 3-kinases in Drosophila identifies a new mediator of signal transduction,8749393,10.1016/s0960-9822(95)00278-8,"Background: Mammalian phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI 3-kinases) are involved in receptor-mediated signal transduction and have been implicated in processes such as transformation and mitogenesis through their role in elevating cellular phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate. Additionally, a PI 3-kinase activity which generates phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate has been shown to be required for protein trafficking in yeast. Results: We have identified a family of three distinct PI 3-kinases in Drosophila, using an approach based on the polymerase chain reaction to amplify a region corresponding to the conserved catalytic domain of PI 3-kinases. One of these family members, PI3K_92D, is closely related to the prototypical PI 3-kinase, p110 alpha; PI3K_59F is homologous to Vps34p, whereas the third, PI3K_68D, is a novel PI 3-kinase which is widely expressed throughout the Drosophila life cycle. The PI3K_68D cDNA encodes a protein of 210 kDa, which lacks sequences implicated in linking p110 PI 3-kinases to p85 adaptor proteins, but contains an amino-terminal proline-rich sequence, which could bind to SH3 domains, and a carboxy-terminal C2 domain. Biochemical analyses demonstrate that PI3K_68D has a novel substrate specificity in vitro, restricted to phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate, and is unable to phosphorylate phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate, the implied in vivo substrate for p110. Conclusions: A family of PI 3-kinases in Drosophila, including a novel class represented by PI3K_68D, is described. PI3K_68D has the potential to bind to signalling molecules containing SH3 domains, lacks p85-adaptor-binding sequences, has a Ca(2+)-independent phospholipid-binding domain and displays a restricted in vitro substrate specificity, so it could define a novel signal transduction pathway.",1995,"L K MacDougall, J Domin, M D Waterfield"
Monoclonal antibody raised against murine IL-1 alpha peptide cross-reacts with a 60-kDa antigen in early Drosophila melanogaster embryo,8565056,10.1007/BF00319117,"Whole-mounts of Drosophila embryos were stained with the monoclonal antibody Vmp 18, raised against the peptide 199-208 of murine interleukin 1/ alpha. Immunofluorescence observations showed that the antibody cross-reacted with an antigenic determinant that changed in localization during Drosophila development. In syncytial Drosophila embryos, the antibody recognized an epitope localized on the nuclear envelope throughout mitotic division. As cellularization occurred, the fluorescence was mainly concentrated in the apical region of the blastoderm cells. Western blot analysis of whole Drosophila embryo extracts showed that the antibody recognized a 60-kDa protein in syncytial embryos and during germ band elongation. This suggests that the 60-kDa antigen undergoes dynamic redistribution during embryogenesis.",1995,"G Callaini, R Dallai, M G Riparbelli"
Modification by chloramphenicol of diethyl sulphate-induced male recombination frequency in Drosophila melanogaster,7590944,,"To study the effect of chloramphenicol (CPL, an inhibitor of protein synthesis) on diethyl sulphate (DES, a potent mutagen) induced male recombination frequency, the F1 (+/aristaless dumpy black cinnabar, al dp b cn) larvae of D. melanogaster were given a pre- or post-treatment of CPL with DES during the first or second half of larval life. In order to determine sensitivity of different germ cell stages to the induction and modification of male recombination frequency, five 3-day broods were taken from every F1 male. DES showed toxic effect on egg-to-adult development. DES was found to be a potent recombinogen. Several cases of non-reciprocal male recombination were recorded. The most frequent recombinant phenotype observed was b cn followed by cn and al. Majority of the recombinants appeared in clusters suggesting their pre-meiotic origin. DES produced male recombination at a stage where only primary spermatocytes were present in the larval testes. CPL when given as a pre- or post-treatment with DES revealed highest frequency of male recombination in broods that represented effect of treatment on spermatogonia predominantly. CPL enhanced the overall level of male recombination produced by DES in both pre- and post-treatments. The results suggested the role of protein synthesis in induction of male recombination in D. melanogaster. In addition, the present experiments give a methodology of enhancing the frequency of chemically-induced male recombination.",1995,"N P Kaur, G S Miglani"
Low temperature persistence of type I antifreeze protein is mediated by cold-specific mRNA stability,8543047,10.1016/0014-5793(95)01340-7,"In winter flounder, the levels of type I antifreeze protein (AFP) and its mRNA vary seasonally by as much as 1000-fold. Elevated levels in the fall are prompted by the loss of long day-lengths, while higher spring temperatures correlate with AFP clearance. We have investigated the role of temperature on AFP accumulation using transgenic Drosophila melanogaster by expressing multiple AFP genes under control of the heat-inducible hsp70 promoter. AFP and AFP mRNA persisted far longer in flies reared at 10 degrees C compared to 22 degrees C. This difference appears to be mediated by cold-specific mRNA stability since no such temperature effect was observed with either an endogenous heat-inducible mRNA or a constitutively expressed mRNA.",1995,"P L Davies, B P Duncker, M D Koops, V K Walker"
Genetic evidence that ovulation reduces sexual receptivity in Drosophila melanogaster females,8540896,10.1007/BF02327581,"Drosophila females start ovulation shortly after mating, and at the same time they become unreceptive to courting males. Both physiological changes are induced by the ""sex-peptide"" derived from the male accessory glands. It is conceivable, therefore, that the first effect of the peptide is to induce ovulation, and some signal derived from ovulated eggs makes females unreceptive. To test this hypothesis, I examined the mating receptivity of virgin D. melanogaster females homozygous for lozenge mutants that showed a high-frequency spontaneous ovulation. These females were reluctant to mate. However, when mature eggs were genetically deprived using nonallelic female sterile mutants, their receptivity increased significantly, although mating speed was still slower than that of normal virgin females. Essentially the same was found with the females that were ectopically expressing the sex-peptide gene. The results indicate that ovulation induced by the sex-peptide has an effect of reducing the sexual receptivity of mated females.",1995,Y Fuyama
Asymmetric segregation of Numb and Prospero during cell division,7566172,10.1038/377624a0,"A cell can divide asymmetrically by specifically segregating a determinant into one of its daughter cells. The Numb protein is a candidate for such a determinant in the asymmetric cell divisions of the developing Drosophila nervous system. Numb is a membrane-associated protein that localizes asymmetrically during cell division and segregates into one daughter cell, where it is required for the specification of the correct cell fate. Here we show that a nuclear protein, Prospero, translocates to the membrane at the beginning of cell division and colocalizes with Numb throughout mitosis, suggesting a common mechanism for asymmetric segregation. Numb and Prospero localization is coupled to mitosis and tightly correlated with the position of one of the two centrosomes. In contrast to centrosome positioning, however, Numb and Prospero localization is independent of microtubules. Cytochalasin D treatment suggests that the process is also independent of actin. We propose that there is an organizer of asymmetric cell division which provides positional information for both the orientation of the mitotic spindle and asymmetric localization of Numb and Prospero.",1995,"J A Knoblich, L Y Jan, Y N Jan"
Interchromosomal exchange of genetic information between gene arrangements on the third chromosome of Drosophila pseudoobscura,7476140,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a040271,"During the last 60 years, the inversion polymorphism on the third chromosome of Drosophila pseudoobscura has become a case study of the evolution of linked blocks of genes, isolated from each other by the suppression of recombination in heterozygotes for different inversions. Due to its location within inverted regions in most gene arrangements, the amylase (Amy) gene region can be used to elucidate the molecular pattern of evolution in these inversions. We studied this region in the Tree Line phylad of gene arrangements, with regard to both restriction site polymorphisms (RSP) and nucleotide sequences. The analysis of restriction maps, encompassing 26 kb, corroborates the cytogenetic phylogeny established on the basis of inversion breakpoints. However, we found that the 2.7 kb of nucleotide sequences of the AmyI gene are identical in both Estes Park and Hidalgo arrangements, despite the fact that these inversions arose independently from Tree Line. These contrasting results suggest that a homogenizing force, most likely gene conversion, is able to bring about localized exchanges between otherwise isolated gene arrangements.",1995,"D Popadić, A Popadić, W W Anderson"
The role of a positioned nucleosome at the Drosophila melanogaster hsp26 promoter,7588603,,"The regulatory region of Drosophila melanogaster hsp26 includes a positioned nucleosome located between the two DNase I hypersensitive (DH) sites that encompass the critical heat shock elements (HSEs). To test the role of this nucleosome in regulated expression, transgenic flies containing hsp26-lacZ fusion genes with alterations in the nucleosome-associated region have been generated. The positioned nucleosome is associated with a DNA sequence that does not itself contain any critical regulatory elements for heat shock-inducible expression. The nucleosome-associated sequence can be deleted, reversed, duplicated or replaced by a random sequence with no significant effect on DH site formation and gene expression. Analyses of hsp26 and hsp70 transgenes with spacing changes within the promoter region indicate that the location of the (CT)n.(GA)n elements dictates the location of DH site formation. Wrapping the DNA between the regulatory elements around a nucleosome is as effective for gene expression as placing the regulatory elements close to each other. A loss of inducible gene expression was observed when the nucleosome-associated DNA was replaced with sequences which appear to misdirect nucleosome placement. The results indicate considerable flexibility in the spacing between DH regulatory sites.",1995,"L L Wallrath, Q Lu, S C Elgin"
Four subunits that are shared by the three classes of RNA polymerase are functionally interchangeable between Homo sapiens and Saccharomyces cerevisiae,7651387,10.1128/mcb.15.9.4702,"Four cDNAs encoding human polypeptides hRPB7.0, hRPB7.6, hRPB17, and hRPB14.4 (referred to as Hs10 alpha, Hs10 beta, Hs8, and Hs6, respectively), homologous to the ABC10 alpha, ABC10 beta, ABC14.5, and ABC23 RNA polymerase subunits (referred to as Sc10 alpha, Sc10 beta, Sc8, and Sc6, respectively) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, were cloned and characterized for their ability to complement defective yeast mutants. Hs10 alpha and the corresponding Sp10 alpha of Schizosaccharomyces pombe can complement an S. cerevisiae mutant (rpc10-delta::HIS3) defective in Sc10 alpha. The peptide sequences are highly conserved in their carboxy-terminal halves, with an invariant motif CX2CX12RCX2CGXR corresponding to a canonical zinc-binding domain.

We observed in stage 1-3 egg chambers accumulation of filamentous actin in the oocyte cytoplasm between the ring canals connecting the oocyte with adjacent nurse cells. Starting from stages 6-7 short microfilament bundles arranged in basket-like structures were associated with the side of the ring canals facing the nurse cell cytoplasm. We also observed a dramatic decrease in the actin network associated with the cortex of the oocyte in stage 10. During stage 10B the nurse cell cytoplasm was crossed by radial actin bundles that showed a sarcomeric-like cross striation after Rh-phalloidin staining.

Subunit-destabilizing mutations in Drosophila copper/zinc superoxide dismutase: neuropathology and a model of dimer dysequilibrium,7567977,10.1073/pnas.92.19.8574,"Mutations in Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD), a hallmark of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FALS) in humans, are shown here to confer striking neuropathology in Drosophila. Heterozygotes with one wild-type and one deleted SOD allele retain the expected 50% of normal activity for this dimeric enzyme. However, heterozygotes with one wild-type and one missense SOD allele show lesser SOD activities, ranging from 37% for a heterozygote carrying a missense mutation predicted from structural models to destabilize the dimer interface, to an average of 13% for several heterozygotes carrying missense mutations predicted to destabilize the subunit fold. Genetic and biochemical evidence suggests a model of dimer dysequilibrium whereby SOD activity in missense heterozygotes is reduced through entrapment of wild-type subunits into unstable or enzymatically inactive heterodimers. This dramatic impairment of the activity of wild-type subunits in vivo has implications for our understanding of FALS and for possible therapeutic strategies.",1995,"K Kirby, J A Tainer, J P Phillips, G L Boulianne, A J Hilliker, E D Getzoff"
Regulation of cytoplasmic RNA stability: Lessons from Drosophila,30109918,10.1002/wrna.1499,"The process of RNA degradation is a critical level of regulation contributing to the control of gene expression. In the last two decades a number of studies have shown the specific and targeted nature of RNA decay and its importance in maintaining homeostasis. The key players within the pathways of RNA decay are well conserved with their mutation or disruption resulting in distinct phenotypes as well as human disease. Model organisms including Drosophila melanogaster have played a substantial role in elucidating the mechanisms conferring control over RNA stability. A particular advantage of this model organism is that the functions of ribonucleases can be assessed in the context of natural cells within tissues in addition to individual immortalized cells in culture. Drosophila RNA stability research has demonstrated how the cytoplasmic decay machines, such as the exosome, Dis3L2 and Xrn1, are responsible for regulating specific processes including apoptosis, proliferation, wound healing and fertility. The work discussed here has begun to identify specific mRNA transcripts that appear sensitive to specific decay pathways representing mechanisms through which the ribonucleases control mRNA stability. Drosophila research has also contributed to our knowledge of how specific RNAs are targeted to the ribonucleases including AU rich elements, miRNA targeting and 3' tailing.

Duox mediates ultraviolet injury-induced nociceptive sensitization in Drosophila larvae,29540218,10.1186/s13041-018-0358-7,"Background: Nociceptive sensitization is an increase in pain perception in response to stimulus. Following brief irradiation of Drosophila larvae with UV, nociceptive sensitization occurs in class IV multiple dendritic (mdIV) neurons, which are polymodal sensory nociceptors. Diverse signaling pathways have been identified that mediate nociceptive sensitization in mdIV neurons, including TNF, Hedgehog, BMP, and Tachykinin, yet the underlying mechanisms are not completely understood. Results: Here we report that duox heterozygous mutant larvae, which have normal basal nociception, exhibit an attenuated hypersensitivity response to heat and mechanical force following UV irradiation. Employing the ppk-Gal4 line, which is exclusively expressed in mdIV neurons, we further show that silencing duox in mdIV neurons attenuates UV-induced sensitization. Conclusions: Our findings reveal a novel role for duox in nociceptive sensitization of Drosophila larvae, and will enhance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying this process in Drosophila sensory neurons.",2018,"Minwoo Baek, Changsoo Kim, Wijeong Jang, Yeon Soo Han"

"The Relationship Between Vitamin B6, Diabetes and Cancer",30271425,10.3389/fgene.2018.00388,"Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP), the active form of vitamin B6, works as cofactor in numerous enzymatic reactions and it behaves as antioxidant molecule. PLP deficiency has been associated to many human pathologies including cancer and diabetes and the mechanism behind this connection is now becoming clearer. Inadequate intake of this vitamin increases the risk of many cancers; furthermore, PLP deprivation impairs insulin secretion in rats, whereas PLP supplementation prevents diabetic complications and improves gestational diabetes. Growing evidence shows that diabetes and cancer are correlated not only because they share same risk factors but also because diabetic patients have a higher risk of developing tumors, although the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. In this review, we will explore data obtained in Drosophila revealing the existence of a connection between vitamin B6, DNA damage and diabetes, as flies in the past decade turned out to be a promising model also for metabolic diseases including diabetes. We will focus on recent studies that revealed a specific role for PLP in maintaining chromosome integrity and glucose homeostasis, and we will show that these aspects are correlated. In addition, we will discuss recent data identifying PLP as a putative linking factor between diabetes and cancer.",2018,"Elisa Mascolo, Isabella Saggio, Romina Burla, Fiammetta Vernì, Chiara Merigliano"
Differentially expressed microRNAs associated with changes of transcript levels in detoxification pathways and DDT-resistance in the Drosophila melanogaster strain 91-R,29698530,10.1371/journal.pone.0196518,"Dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT) resistance among arthropod species is a model for understanding the molecular adaptations in response to insecticide exposures. Previous studies reported that DDT resistance may involve one or multiple detoxification genes, such as cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s), glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), esterases, and ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters, or changes in the voltage-sensitive sodium channel. However, the possible involvement of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the post-transcriptional regulation of genes associated with DDT resistance in the Drosophila melanogaster strain 91-R remains poorly understood. In this study, the majority of the resulting miRNAs discovered in small RNA libraries from 91-R and the susceptible control strain, 91-C, ranged from 16-25 nt, and contained 163 precursors and 256 mature forms of previously-known miRNAs along with 17 putative novel miRNAs. Quantitative analyses predicted the differential expression of ten miRNAs between 91-R and 91-C, and, based on Gene Ontology and pathway analysis, these ten miRNAs putatively target transcripts encoding proteins involved in detoxification mechanisms. RT-qPCR validated an inverse correlation between levels of differentially-expressed miRNAs and their putatively targeted transcripts, which implies a role of these miRNAs in the differential regulation of detoxification pathways in 91-R compared to 91-C. This study provides evidence associating the differential expression of miRNAs in response to multigenerational DDT selection in Drosophila melanogaster and provides important clues for understanding the possible roles of miRNAs in mediating insecticide resistance traits.",2018,"Do-Hyup Kim, Barry R Pittendrigh, Keon Mook Seong, Allison K Hansen, Brad S Coates"
Combined expansion microscopy with structured illumination microscopy for analyzing protein complexes,30072723,10.1038/s41596-018-0023-8,"Biologists have long been fascinated with the organization and function of intricate protein complexes. Therefore, techniques for precisely imaging protein complexes and the location of proteins within these complexes are critically important and often require multidisciplinary collaboration. A challenge in these explorations is the limited resolution of conventional light microscopy. However, a new microscopic technique has circumvented this resolution limit by making the biological sample larger, thus allowing for super-resolution of the enlarged structure. This 'expansion' is accomplished by embedding the sample in a hydrogel that, when exposed to water, uniformly expands. Here, we present a protocol that transforms thick expansion microscopy (ExM) hydrogels into sections that are physically expanded four times, creating samples that are compatible with the super-resolution technique structured illumination microscopy (SIM). This super-resolution ExM method (ExM-SIM) allows the analysis of the three-dimensional (3D) organization of multiprotein complexes at ~30-nm lateral (xy) resolution. This protocol details the steps necessary for analysis of protein localization using ExM-SIM, including antibody labeling, hydrogel preparation, protease digestion, post-digestion antibody labeling, hydrogel embedding with tissue-freezing medium (TFM), cryosectioning, expansion, image alignment, and particle averaging. We have used this approach for 3D mapping of in situ protein localization in the Drosophila synaptonemal complex (SC), but it can be readily adapted to study thick tissues such as brain and organs in various model systems. This procedure can be completed in 5 d.",2018,"Jay R Unruh, Nancy Thomas, Brian D Slaughter, Tari Parmely, Yongfu Wang, Cori K Cahoon, R Scott Hawley, Zulin Yu"
The Pax protein Eyegone (Eyg) interacts with the pi-RNA component Aubergine (Aub) and controls egg chamber development in Drosophila,29278721,10.1016/j.ydbio.2017.12.012,"The eyegone (eyg) gene encodes Eyg, a transcription factor of the Pax family with multiple roles during Drosophila development.

The protein is present from the germarium until stage 10 of cyst development. The majority of egg chambers that develop in the absence of Eyg arrest their development before stage 10, show augmented levels of the telomeric retro-transposon TART-A and low levels of heterochromatin marks in the oocyte nucleus. During the maternal to zygotic transition (MTZ) Eyg seems to play a role in destabilizing germ cell less (gcl) and oo 16 RNA binding protein (orb) mRNAs.

Isoflurane Impairs Low-Frequency Feedback but Leaves High-Frequency Feedforward Connectivity Intact in the Fly Brain,29541686,10.1523/ENEURO.0329-17.2018,"Hierarchically organized brains communicate through feedforward (FF) and feedback (FB) pathways. In mammals, FF and FB are mediated by higher and lower frequencies during wakefulness. FB is preferentially impaired by general anesthetics in multiple mammalian species. This suggests FB serves critical functions in waking brains. The brain of Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) is also hierarchically organized, but the presence of FB in these brains is not established. Here, we studied FB in the fly brain, by simultaneously recording local field potentials (LFPs) from low-order peripheral structures and higher-order central structures. We analyzed the data using Granger causality (GC), the first application of this analysis technique to recordings from the insect brain. Our analysis revealed that low frequencies (0.1-5 Hz) mediated FB from the center to the periphery, while higher frequencies (10-45 Hz) mediated FF in the opposite direction. Further, isoflurane anesthesia preferentially reduced FB. Our results imply that the spectral characteristics of FF and FB may be a signature of hierarchically organized brains that is conserved from insects to mammals. We speculate that general anesthetics may induce unresponsiveness across species by targeting the mechanisms that support FB.",2018,"Naotsugu Tsuchiya, Bruno van Swinderen, Dror Cohen"
Distinct multilevel misregulations of Parkin and PINK1 revealed in cell and animal models of TDP-43 proteinopathy,30237395,10.1038/s41419-018-1022-y,"Parkin and PINK1 play an important role in mitochondrial quality control, whose malfunction may also be involved in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Excessive TDP-43 accumulation is a pathological hallmark of ALS and is associated with Parkin protein reduction in spinal cord neurons from sporadic ALS patients. In this study, we reveal that Parkin and PINK1 are differentially misregulated in TDP-43 proteinopathy at RNA and protein levels. Using knock-in flies, mouse primary neurons, and TDP-43Q331K transgenic mice, we further unveil that TDP-43 downregulates Parkin mRNA, which involves an unidentified, intron-independent mechanism and requires the RNA-binding and the protein-protein interaction functions of TDP-43. Unlike Parkin, TDP-43 does not regulate PINK1 at an RNA level. Instead, excess of TDP-43 causes cytosolic accumulation of cleaved PINK1 due to impaired proteasomal activity, leading to compromised mitochondrial functions. Consistent with the alterations at the molecular and cellular levels, we show that transgenic upregulation of Parkin but downregulation of PINK1 suppresses TDP-43-induced degenerative phenotypes in a Drosophila model of ALS. Together, these findings highlight the challenge associated with the heterogeneity and complexity of ALS pathogenesis, while pointing to Parkin-PINK1 as a common pathway that may be differentially misregulated in TDP-43 proteinopathy.",2018,"Jian-Chiuan Li, Yanshan Fang, Ke Xiang, Xu Cao, Chun-Hong Chen, Ang Li, Jiangxia Ni, Kuili Tian, Xing Sun, Yongjia Duan, Xue Deng, Caixia Qin, Gang Duan"
Desiccation resistance: effect of cuticular hydrocarbons and water content in Drosophila melanogaster adults,29456884,10.7717/peerj.4318,"Background: The insect cuticle covers the whole body and all appendages and has bi-directionnal selective permeability: it protects against environmental stress and pathogen infection and also helps to reduce water loss. The adult cuticle is often associated with a superficial layer of fatty acid-derived molecules such as waxes and long chain hydrocarbons that prevent rapid dehydration. The waterproofing properties of cuticular hydrocarbons (CHs) depend on their chain length and desaturation number. Drosophila CH biosynthesis involves an enzymatic pathway including several elongase and desaturase enzymes. Methods: The link between desiccation resistance and CH profile remains unclear, so we tested (1) experimentally selected desiccation-resistant lines, (2) transgenic flies with altered desaturase expression and (3) natural and laboratory-induced CH variants. We also explored the possible relationship between desiccation resistance, relative water content and fecundity in females. Results: We found that increased desiccation resistance is linked with the increased proportion of desaturated CHs, but not with their total amount. Experimentally-induced desiccation resistance and CH variation both remained stable after many generations without selection. Conversely, flies with a higher water content and a lower proportion of desaturated CHs showed reduced desiccation resistance. This was also the case in flies with defective desaturase expression in the fat body. Discussion: We conclude that rapidly acquired desiccation resistance, depending on both CH profile and water content, can remain stable without selection in a humid environment. These three phenotypes, which might be expected to show a simple relationship, turn out to have complex physiological and genetic links.",2018,"Karen Rihani, Jean-Francois Ferveur, Claude Everaerts, Jérôme Cortot, Matthew Cobb"
Genetic dissection of stress-induced reproductive arrest in Drosophila melanogaster females,29889831,10.1371/journal.pgen.1007434,"By genetic manipulations, we study the roles played by insulin-producing cells (IPCs) in the brain and their target, the corpora allata (CA), for reproductive dormancy in female Drosophila melanogaster, which is induced by exposing them to a combination of low temperature (11°C), short-day photoperiod (10L:14D) and starvation (water only) for 7 days immediately after eclosion (dormancy-inducing conditions). Artificial inactivation of IPCs promotes, whereas artificial activation impedes, the induction of reproductive dormancy. A transcriptional reporter assay reveals that the IPC activity is reduced when the female flies are exposed to dormancy-inducing conditions. The photoperiod sensitivity of reproductive dormancy is lost in pigment-dispersing factor (pdf), but not cry, mutants, suggesting that light input to IPCs is mediated by pdf-expressing neurons. Genetic manipulations to upregulate and downregulate insulin signaling in the CA, a pair of endocrine organs that synthesize the juvenile hormone (JH), decrease and increase the incidence of reproductive dormancy, respectively. These results demonstrate that the IPC-CA axis constitutes a key regulatory pathway for reproductive dormancy.",2018,"Noriyuki Ojima, Hiroki Ito, Daisuke Yamamoto, Yusuke Hara"
Effect of heterochromatin stability on intestinal stem cell aging in Drosophila,29625135,10.1016/j.mad.2018.04.001,"Chromatin change is one of the crucial causes of aging. Specifically, maintenance of heterochromatin stability is critical for cellular integrity, and its loss induces genomic instability and cellular aging. However, the causes and effects of heterochromatin instability in multicellular tissue aging still remain unclear. Here, in the adult Drosophila midgut, we report age-related loss of heterochromatin stability in enterocytes (ECs) due to the loss and dispersion of tri-methylated histone H3 Lys9 (H3K9me3) and heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1). Our study further shows that EC-specific knockdown of Su(var)3-9, histone lysine methyltransferase for H3K9me3 formation, or HP1a leads to intestinal stem cell (ISC) aging through genomic stress, JNK signaling, and apoptotic death in ECs. Our findings revealed the plausible causes of age-related loss of heterochromatin stability in ECs, including oxidative stress and nutrient-sensing AKT/TOR signaling. Taken together, the loss of heterochromatin stability may be the crucial niche aging mechanism for ISC aging which is the prime determinant of intestinal tissue aging.

These model systems have also helped uncover new functions for many gene products, revealing previously unknown virulence mechanisms.

Assays to measure both virulence and colonization have been established and are easily adopted in labs unfamiliar with Drosophila work. Experiments to compare survival of flies colonized with different bacterial mutants are simple to perform and can be completed in less than a week, allowing colonization to be quantified and localized easily. The availability of molecular and genetic tools for the fly enables further exploration of host factors that restrict V. cholerae colonization and invasive infection. Based on the Drosophila system, a house fly (Musca domestica) model of V. cholerae colonization has also been developed. The new house fly model may prove a useful tool for examining V. cholerae infection dynamics in the context of a host carrying a complex microbial community, with a fundamentally different ecology that may increase its chances of acting as a vector for cholera disease.",2018,Alexandra E Purdy

The drosomycin multigene family: three-disulfide variants from Drosophila takahashii possess antibacterial activity,27562645,10.1038/srep32175,"Drosomycin (DRS) is a strictly antifungal peptide in Drosophila melanogaster, which contains four disulfide bridges (DBs) with three buried in molecular interior and one exposed on molecular surface to tie the amino- and carboxyl-termini of the molecule together (called wrapper disulfide bridge, WDB). Based on computational analysis of genomes of Drosophila species belonging to the Oriental lineage, we identified a new multigene family of DRS in Drosphila takahashii that includes a total of 11 DRS-encoding genes (termed DtDRS-1 to DtDRS-11) and a pseudogene. Phylogenetic tree and synteny analyses reveal orthologous relationship between DtDRSs and DRSs, indicating that orthologous genes of DRS-1, DRS-2, DRS-3 and DRS-6 have undergone duplication in D. takahashii and three amplifications (DtDRS-9 to DtDRS-11) of DRS-3 have lost WDB. Among the 11 genes, five are transcriptionally active in adult fruitflies.

Intensity of Mutualism Breakdown Is Determined by Temperature Not Amplification of Wolbachia Genes,27661080,10.1371/journal.ppat.1005888,"Wolbachia are maternally transmitted intracellular bacterial symbionts that infect approximately 40% of all insect species. Though several strains of Wolbachia naturally infect Drosophila melanogaster and provide resistance against viral pathogens, or provision metabolites during periods of nutritional stress, one virulent strain, wMelPop, reduces fly lifespan by half, possibly as a consequence of over-replication. While the mechanisms that allow wMelPop to over-replicate are still of debate, a unique tandem repeat locus in the wMelPop genome that contains eight genes, referred to as the ""Octomom"" locus has been identified and is thought to play an important regulatory role. Estimates of Octomom locus copy number correlated increasing copy number to both Wolbachia bacterial density and increased pathology. Here we demonstrate that infected fly pathology is not dependent on an increased Octomom copy number, but does strongly correlate with increasing temperature. When measured across developmental time, we also show Octomom copy number to be highly variable across developmental time within a single generation. Using a second pathogenic strain of Wolbachia, we further demonstrate reduced insect lifespan can occur independently of a high Octomom locus copy number.

A role for tuned levels of nucleosome remodeler subunit ACF1 during Drosophila oogenesis,26851213,10.1016/j.ydbio.2016.01.039,"The Chromatin Accessibility Complex (CHRAC) consists of the ATPase ISWI, the large ACF1 subunit and a pair of small histone-like proteins, CHRAC-14/16. CHRAC is a prototypical nucleosome sliding factor that mobilizes nucleosomes to improve the regularity and integrity of the chromatin fiber. This may facilitate the formation of repressive chromatin. Expression of the signature subunit ACF1 is restricted during embryonic development, but remains high in primordial germ cells. Therefore, we explored roles for ACF1 during Drosophila oogenesis. ACF1 is expressed in somatic and germline cells, with notable enrichment in germline stem cells and oocytes. The asymmetrical localization of ACF1 to these cells depends on the transport of the Acf1 mRNA by the Bicaudal-D/Egalitarian complex. Loss of ACF1 function in the novel Acf1(7) allele leads to defective egg chambers and their elimination through apoptosis. In addition, we find a variety of unusual 16-cell cyst packaging phenotypes in the previously known Acf1(1) allele, with a striking prevalence of egg chambers with two functional oocytes at opposite poles. Surprisingly, we found that the Acf1(1) deletion--despite disruption of the Acf1 reading frame--expresses low levels of a PHD-bromodomain module from the C-terminus of ACF1 that becomes enriched in oocytes. Expression of this module from the Acf1 genomic locus leads to packaging defects in the absence of functional ACF1, suggesting competitive interactions with unknown target molecules. Remarkably, a two-fold overexpression of CHRAC (ACF1 and CHRAC-16) leads to increased apoptosis and packaging defects. Evidently, finely tuned CHRAC levels are required for proper oogenesis.",2016,"Dhawal Jain, Alexander Konev, Beat Suter, Paula Vazquez-Pianzola, Dmitry V Fyodorov, Sandra Vengadasalam, Natascha Steffen, Pavel Tomancak, Peter B Becker, Kenneth Börner"
Base-pair-resolution genome-wide mapping of active RNA polymerases using precision nuclear run-on (PRO-seq),27442863,10.1038/nprot.2016.086,"We provide a protocol for precision nuclear run-on sequencing (PRO-seq) and its variant, PRO-cap, which map the location of active RNA polymerases (PRO-seq) or transcription start sites (TSSs) (PRO-cap) genome-wide at high resolution. The density of RNA polymerases at a particular genomic locus directly reflects the level of nascent transcription at that region. Nuclei are isolated from cells and, under nuclear run-on conditions, transcriptionally engaged RNA polymerases incorporate one or, at most, a few biotin-labeled nucleotide triphosphates (biotin-NTPs) into the 3' end of nascent RNA. The biotin-labeled nascent RNA is used to prepare sequencing libraries, which are sequenced from the 3' end to provide high-resolution positional information for the RNA polymerases. PRO-seq provides much higher sensitivity than ChIP-seq, and it generates a much larger fraction of usable sequence reads than ChIP-seq or NET-seq (native elongating transcript sequencing). Similarly to NET-seq, PRO-seq maps the RNA polymerase at up to base-pair resolution with strand specificity, but unlike NET-seq it does not require immunoprecipitation.

We identify buttonhead and empty spiracles as the major activators of cdc25(string) expression in mitotic domain 2. The effect of these activators is balanced through repression by hairy, sloppy paired 1, and huckebein. Within the mitotic domain, temporal precision of mitosis is robust and unaffected by changing dosage of rate-limiting transcriptional factors. However, precision can be disrupted by altering the levels of the two activators or two repressors.

HAP1 shares a conserved ""HAP1_N"" domain with TRAfficking Kinesin proteins TRAK1 and TRAK2 (vertebrate), Milton (Drosophila) and T27A3.1 (C. elegans). HAP1, TRAK1 and TRAK2 have a degree of common function, particularly regarding intracellular receptor trafficking. However, TRAK1, TRAK2 and Milton (which have a ""Milt/TRAK"" domain that is absent in human and rodent HAP1) differ in function to HAP1 in that they are mitochondrial transport proteins, while HAP1 has emerging roles in starvation response. We have investigated HAP1 function by examining its evolution, and upstream gene promoter sequences. We performed phylogenetic analyses of the HAP1_N domain family of proteins, incorporating HAP1 orthologues (identified by genomic synteny) from 5 vertebrate classes, and also searched the Dictyostelium proteome for a common ancestor. Computational analyses of mammalian HAP1 gene promoters were performed to identify phylogenetically conserved regulatory motifs. Results: We found that as recently as marsupials, HAP1 contained a Milt/TRAK domain and was more similar to TRAK1 and TRAK2 than to eutherian HAP1. The Milt/TRAK domain likely arose post multicellularity, as it was absent in the Dictyostelium proteome. It was lost from HAP1 in the eutherian lineage, and also from T27A3.1 in C. elegans. The HAP1 promoter from human, mouse, rat, rabbit, horse, dog, Tasmanian devil and opossum contained common sites for transcription factors involved in cell cycle, growth, differentiation, and stress response. A conserved arrangement of regulatory elements was identified, including sites for caudal-related homeobox transcription factors (CDX1 and CDX2), and myc-associated factor X (MAX) in the region of the TATA box. CDX1 and CDX2 are intestine-enriched factors, prompting investigation of HAP1 protein expression in the human duodenum. HAP1 was localized to singly dispersed mucosal cells, including a subset of serotonin-positive enterochromaffin cells. Conclusion: We have identified eutherian HAP1 as an evolutionarily recent adaptation of a vertebrate TRAK protein-like ancestor, and found conserved CDX1/CDX2 and MAX transcription factor binding sites near the TATA box in mammalian HAP1 gene promoters.

We show that PDF feedback is required for maintaining normal oscillation pattern in CLK-driven transcription. Interestingly, we found that CLK and neuronal firing suppresses pdf transcription, likely through a common pathway involving the transcription factors DHR38 and SR, establishing a direct link between electric activity and the circadian system. In sum, our work provides evidence for the existence of an uncharacterized CLK-PDF feedback loop that tightly wraps together the molecular oscillator with the circadian neuronal network in Drosophila.",2016,"Bart Deplancke, Sebastian Kadener, Jean Daniel Feuz, Shaul Mezan"

Drosophila type IV collagen mutation associates with immune system activation and intestinal dysfunction,26363084,10.1016/j.matbio.2015.09.002,"The basal lamina (BM) contains numerous components with a predominance of type IV collagens.

In Drosophila, the phenotype associated with dominant temperature sensitive mutations of col4a1 include severe myopathy resulting from massive degradation of striated muscle fibers, and in the gut, degeneration of circular visceral muscle cells and epithelial cells following detachment from the BM.

Global gene expression analysis revealed activation of the effector AMP genes of the primary innate immune system including Metchnikowin, Diptericin, Diptericin B, and edin that preceded morphological changes. Attacin::GFP midgut expression pattern further supported these changes. An increase in ROS production and changes in gut bacterial flora were also noted and may have further enhanced an immune response. The phenotypic features of Drosophila col4a1 mutants confirmed an essential role for type IV collagen in maintaining epithelial integrity, gut morphology and intestinal function and suggest that aberrant structure and function of the COL4A1 protein may also be a significant factor in modulating immunity.",2016,"Márton Kiss, Edit Hermesz, Mátyás Mink, Nikoletta Popovics, Katalin Csiszár, András A Kiss, Monika Radics"
Evolutionary Transitions of MicroRNA-Target Pairs,27189995,10.1093/gbe/evw092,"How newly generated microRNA (miRNA) genes are integrated into gene regulatory networks during evolution is fundamental in understanding the molecular and evolutionary bases of robustness and plasticity in gene regulation. A recent model proposed that after the birth of a miRNA, the miRNA is generally integrated into the network by decreasing the number of target genes during evolution. However, this decreasing model remains to be carefully examined by considering in vivo conditions. In this study, we therefore compared the number of target genes among miRNAs with different ages, combining experiments with bioinformatics predictions. First, we focused on three Drosophila miRNAs with different ages. As a result, we found that an older miRNA has a greater number of target genes than a younger miRNA, suggesting the increasing number of targets for each miRNA during evolution (increasing model). To further confirm our results, we also predicted all target genes for all miRNAs in D. melanogaster, considering co-expression of miRNAs and mRNAs in vivo The results obtained also do not support the decreasing model but are reasonably consistent with the increasing model of miRNA-target pairs. Furthermore, our large-scale analyses of currently available experimental data of miRNA-target pairs also showed a weak but the same trend in humans. These results indicate that the current decreasing model of miRNA-target pairs should be reconsidered and the increasing model may be more appropriate to explain the evolutionary transitions of miRNA-target pairs in many organisms.",2016,"Kanako Onizuka, Masafumi Nozawa, Chie Iwamoto, Nana Fukuda, Mai Fujimi, Kazuho Ikeo, Takashi Gojobori"
Genetic and Sex-Specific Transgenerational Effects of a High Fat Diet in Drosophila melanogaster,27518304,10.1371/journal.pone.0160857,"An organism's phenotype is the product of its environment and genotype, but an ancestor's environment can also be a contributing factor. The recent increase in caloric intake and decrease in physical activity of developed nations' populations is contributing to deteriorating health and making the study of the longer term impacts of a changing lifestyle a priority. The dietary habits of ancestors have been shown to affect phenotype in several organisms, including humans, mice, and the fruit fly. Whether the ancestral dietary effect is purely environmental or if there is a genetic interaction with the environment passed down for multiple generations, has not been determined previously. Here we used the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, to investigate the genetic, sex-specific, and environmental effects of a high fat diet for three generations' on pupal body weights across ten genotypes. We also tested for genotype-specific transgenerational effects on metabolic pools and egg size across three genotypes. We showed that there were substantial differences in transgenerational responses to ancestral diet between genotypes and sexes through both first and second descendant generations. Additionally, there were differences in phenotypes between maternally and paternally inherited dietary effects. We also found a treated organism's reaction to a high fat diet was not a consistent predictor of its untreated descendants' phenotype. The implication of these results is that, given our interest in understanding and preventing metabolic diseases like obesity, we need to consider the contribution of ancestral environmental experiences. However, we need to be cautious when drawing population-level generalization from small studies because transgenerational effects are likely to exhibit substantial sex and genotype specificity.",2016,"Kelly Dew-Budd, Julie Jarnigan, Laura K Reed"
Reduction in the cumulative effect of stress-induced inbreeding depression due to intragenerational purging in Drosophila melanogaster,26604190,10.1038/hdy.2015.103,"Environmental stress generally exacerbates the harmful effects of inbreeding and it has been proposed that this could be exploited in purging deleterious alleles from threatened inbred populations. However, understanding what factors contribute to variability in the strength of inbreeding depression (ID) observed across adverse environmental conditions remains a challenge. Here, we examined how the nature and timing of stress affects ID and the potential for purging using inbred and outbred Drosophila melanogaster larvae exposed to biotic (larval competition, bacteria infection) and abiotic (ethanol, heat) stressors compared with unstressed controls. ID was measured during (larval survival) and after (male mating success) stress exposure. The level of stress imposed by each stressor was approximately equal, averaging a 42% reduction in outbred larval survival relative to controls. All stressors induced on average the same ID, causing a threefold increase in lethal equivalents for larval survival relative to controls. However, stress-induced ID in larval success was followed by a 30% reduction in ID in mating success of surviving males. We propose that this fitness recovery is due to 'intragenerational purging' whereby fitness correlations facilitate stress-induced purging that increases the average fitness of survivors in later life history stages. For biotic stressors, post-stress reductions in ID are consistent with intragenerational purging, whereas for abiotic stressors, there appeared to be an interaction between purging and stress-induced physiological damage. For all stressors, there was no net effect of stress on lifetime ID compared with unstressed controls, undermining the prediction that stress enhances the effectiveness of population-level purging across generations.",2016,"L Nunney, L S Enders"
Existence of two acetylcholinesterases in the mosquito Culex pipiens (Diptera:Culicidae),8863521,10.1046/j.1471-4159.1996.67052115.x,"Two acetylcholinesterases (AChEs), AChE1 and AChE2, differing in substrate specificity and in some aspects of inhibitor sensitivity, have been characterized in the mosquito Culex pipiens. The results of ultracentrifugation in sucrose gradients and nondenaturing gel electrophoresis of AChE activity peak fractions show that each AChE is present as two molecular forms: one amphiphilic dimer possessing a glycolipid anchor and one hydrophilic dimer that does not interact with nondenaturing detergents. Treatment by phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C converts each type of amphiphilic dimer into the corresponding hydrophilic dimer. Molecular forms of AChE1 have a lower electrophoretic mobility than those of AChE2. However, amphiphilic dimers and hydrophilic dimers have similar sedimentation coefficients (5.5S and 6.5S, respectively). AChE1 and AChE2 dimers, amphiphilic or hydrophilic, resist dithiothreitol reduction under conditions that allow reduction of Drosophila AChE dimers. In the insecticide-susceptible strain S-LAB, AChE1 is inhibited by 5 x 10(-4) M propoxur (a carbamate insecticide), whereas AChE2 is resistant. All animals are killed by this concentration of propoxur, indicating that only AChE1 fulfills the physiological function of neurotransmitter hydrolysis at synapses. In the insecticide-resistant strain, MSE, there is no mortality after exposure to 5 x 10(-4) M propoxur: AChE2 sensitivity to propoxur is unchanged, whereas AChE1 is now resistant to 5 x 10(-4) M propoxur. The possibility that AChE1 and AChE2 are products of tissue-specific posttranslational modifications of a single gene is discussed, but we suggest, based on recent results obtained at the molecular level in mosquitoes, that they are encoded by two different genes.",1996,"M Raymond, C A Malcolm, D Fournier, D Bourguet, M Arpagaus, J P Toutant"
Drosophila TFIIA-S is up-regulated and required during Ras-mediated photoreceptor determination,8557194,10.1101/gad.10.1.50,"Photoreceptor induction in the developing Drosophila eye is triggered by the activation of the Ras pathway. Subsequently, the Ras-mediated activation of site-specific transcription factors leads to the expression of putative ""effector"" genes. The coactivator function of the basal transcription factor TFIIA has been shown previously to enhance the trans-activation potential of site-specific transcription factors in vitro. Here, we show that the expression of the small subunit of TFIIA (dTFIIA-S) is specifically up-regulated in a transient manner during Ras-mediated photoreceptor induction. Furthermore, although null mutations in dTFIIA-S are cell lethal, a hypomorphic dTFIIA-S allele demonstrates an increased requirement for this factor during photoreceptor development. In addition, the cone cell to R7 photoreceptor transformation caused by ectopic activation of the Ras pathway during eye development is suppressed by the removal of one functional copy of the dTFIIA-S locus revealing the sensitivity of this process to reductions in dTFIIA-S activity. These results are the first in vivo evidence for the coactivator function in transcriptional enhancement proposed for TFIIA.",1996,"M P Zeidler, R Tjian, M Mlodzik, K Yokomori"
Antagonizing cAMP-dependent protein kinase A in the dorsal CNS activates a conserved Sonic hedgehog signaling pathway,8787761,,"Hedgehog (Hh) signaling plays a significant role in defining the polarity of a variety of tissue types along the anterior/posterior and dorsal/ventral axes in both vertebrate and invertebrate organisms. The pathway through which Hh transduces its signal is still obscure, however, recent data have implicated the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A as a negative regulator of the Hh signal transduction pathway. One of the vertebrate Hh family members, Sonic hedgehog (Shh), can induce ventral neural cell types both in vivo and in vitro; high concentrations induce floor plate and lower concentrations motor neurons. To investigate whether PKA plays an active role in the suppression of ventral neural differentiation, we generated transgenic embryos expressing a dominant negative form of PKA (dnPKA) in primarily dorsal aspects of the mouse CNS. Similar to our earlier results with Shh, we observed the induction of floor plate and motor neuron markers in embryos expressing the dominant negative PKA transgene and the loss of dorsal gene expression at rostral levels. Thus suppression of PKA activity is sufficient to activate targets of the Shh signaling pathway in the vertebrate CNS suggesting that induction of ventral cell types occurs via the antagonistic action of Shh on PKA activity. Two mammalian target genes that are strongly expressed in ectopic dorsal locations in response to dnPKA are Ptc and Gli. As both of these are targets of Drosophila Hh signaling, our data point to an evolutionary conservation in both the mechanisms of signaling and the effectors of the signaling pathway.",1996,"M P Scott, A P McMahon, E Marti, D J Epstein"
Cloning of the Drosophila melanogaster meiotic recombination gene mei-218: a genetic and molecular analysis of interval 15E,8878687,,"The mei-218 gene product is required for both meiotic crossing over and for the production of recombination modules, suggesting that these organelles are required for meiotic exchange. In this study the null phenotype of mei-218 was defined through the analysis of three preexisting and five new alleles. Consistent with previous studies, in homozygous mei-218 mutants meiotic crossing over is reduced to < 10% of normal levels. A molecular analysis of mei-218 was initiated with the isolation and mapping of lethal mutations and genome rearrangements in the region containing mei-218, polytene interval 15E on the X chromosome. This high resolution genetic map was aligned with a physical map constructed from cosmid and P1 clones by genetically mapping restriction fragment length polymorphisms and localizing rearrangement breakpoints. Within a region of 65 kb, we have identified seven transcription units, including mei-218 and the Minute(1)15D gene, which encodes ribosomal protein S5. The mei-218 mutant phenotype has been rescued by germline transformation with both a genomic fragment and a cDNA under the control of the hsp83 promoter. The mei-218 gene is predicted to produce an 1186-amino acid protein that has no significant similarities to any known proteins.",1996,"J B Dahmus, K S McKim, R S Hawley"
Early neurogenesis of the Drosophila brain,8799858,10.1002/(SICI)1096-9861(19960701)370:3<313::AID-CNE3>3.0.CO;2-7,"We have studied the formation of the neuroblasts of the Drosophila brain which segregate from the procephalic neurectoderm. The expression domains of the segment polarity gene engrailed (en) allow one to subdivide the procephalic neuroectoderm into tritocerebral, deuterocerebral, and protocerebral neuromeres. Based upon the expression pattern of the proneural gene lethal of scute (l'sc), as well as the pattern of brain neuroblast segregation, the protocerebral and deuterocerebral neuromeres can be further subdivided into a central, anterior, and posterior domain. A total of 75-80 neuroblasts segregate in a stereotyped pattern from the procephalic neurectoderm of each side during stages 9-11. With respect to their position and the expression of the markers asense (ase) and seven-up (svp), 23 small groups of one to five neuroblasts each were identified. The first eight groups (Pc1-4, Dc1-3, Dp1), collectively called SI/II neuroblasts in analogy to the subpopulation of ventral neuroblasts which appear at the same stage), arise from the central domain of the protocerebral and deuterocerebral neurectoderm, respectively. Later groups form anteriorly and posteriorly from the earlier ones, leading to a centrifugal growth of the procephalic neuroblast population. SIII neuroblasts (Pa1-4, Pp1-2, Dp2) arise during stage 10, SIV neuroblasts (Pa5-6, Pp3-4, Da1, T1-2) during early stage 11, and SV neuroblasts (Pp5, Pdm) during late stage 11 and early stage 12. The dorsomedial domain of the procephalic neurectoderm represents a special case. Unlike other procephalic neuroblasts which delaminate from the surface ectoderm as individual cells, cells of the dorsomedial protocerebral domain are internalized during stage 12 as large, coherent clusters by a movement which can be best characterized as a combination of mass-delamination and invagination.",1996,"V Hartenstein, C Nassif, P Green, A Younossi-Hartenstein"
"The SH2-containing tyrosine phosphatase corkscrew is required during signaling by sevenless, Ras1 and Raf",8620840,,"The sevenless gene encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase which is required for the development of the R7 photoreceptor cell in each ommatidium of the Drosophila eye. We have previously used a sensitized genetic screen to identify mutations, designated Enhancers of sevenless (E(sev)), which affect genes that encode components of the sevenless signaling pathway. Here, we report that one of these mutations, E(sev)1Ae0P is a dominantly inhibiting allele of corkscrew, which encodes an SH2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase (Perkins et al., 1992). We show that corkscrew function is essential for sevenless signaling and that expression of a membrane-targeted form of corkscrew can drive R7 photoreceptor development in the absence of sevenless function. Furthermore, we have used the dominantly inhibiting corkscrew allele to examine the role of corkscrew during signaling by activated forms of Ras1 and Raf. Our analysis indicates that corkscrew function is still required during signaling by activated forms Ras1 and Raf proteins. These results define a function for corkscrew that is either downstream of Ras1 activation or in a parallel pathway that acts with activated Ras1/Raf to specify R7 photoreceptor development.",1996,"H McNeill, M A Simon, J D Allard, H C Chang, R Herbst"
"Semaphorin III is needed for normal patterning and growth of nerves, bones and heart",8849723,10.1038/383525a0,"The expression patterns of the recently discovered family of semaphorin genes suggests that they have widespread roles in embryonic development. Some seem to guide neuronal growth cones, but otherwise their functions are unknown. Semaphorin III is a membrane-associated secreted protein with a developmentally dynamic pattern of expression, including particular domains of the nervous system, the borders of developing bones, and the heart. In vitro, semaphorin III causes growth-cone collapse, and repels cutaneous sensory axons from the ventral spinal cord. Mutants in the Drosophila gene semaII, which encodes a related semaphorin, die after eclosion, but no responsible abnormality is evident. We have generated mice mutant in the semaIII gene by homologous recombination. Here we show that in the mutants, some sensory axons project into inappropriate regions of the spinal cord where semaIII is normally expressed. The cerebral cortex of homozygous mutant mice shows a paucity of neuropil and abnormally oriented neuronal processes, especially of the large pyramidal neurons. Certain embryonic bones and cartilaginous structures develop abnormally, with vertebral fusions and partial rib duplications. The few mice that survive more than a few days postnatally manifest pronounced and selective hypertrophy of the right ventricle of the heart and dilation of the right atrium. Thus, semaphorin III might serve as a signal that restrains growth in several developing organs.",1996,"M C Fishman, J A Golden, F J Schoen, O Behar, H Mashimo"

Polygenic mutation in Drosophila melanogaster: genetic interactions between selection lines and candidate quantitative trait loci,8889529,,"We have investigated genetic interactions between spontaneous mutations affecting abdominal and sternopleural bristle number that have accumulated in 12 long-term selection lines derived from an inbred strain, and mutations at 14 candidate bristle number quantitative trait loci. The quantitative test for complementation was to cross the selection lines to an inbred wild-type strain (the control cross) and to a derivative of the control strain into which the mutant allele at the candidate locus to be tested was substituted (the tester strain). Genetic interactions between spontaneous mutations affecting bristle number and the candidate locus mutations were common, and in several cases the interaction effects were different in males and females. Analyses of variance of the (tester- control) differences among and within groups of replicate lines selected in the same direction for the same trait showed significant group effects for several candidate loci. Genetically, the interactions could be caused by allelism of, and/ or epistasis between, spontaneous mutations in the selection lines and the candidate locus mutations. It is possible that much of the response to selection was from new mutations at candidate bristle number quantitative trait loci, and that for some of these loci, mutation rates were high.",1996,"T F Mackay, J D Fry"
Structural organization and chromosomal assignment of the mouse embryonic TEA domain-containing factor (ETF) gene,8812452,10.1006/geno.1996.0461,"Embryonic TEA domain-containing factor (ETF) belongs to the family of proteins structurally related to transcriptional enhancer factor-1 (TEF-1) and is implicated in neural development.

The exon-intron structure of Etdf closely resembles that of the Drosophila scalloped gene, indicating that these genes may have evolved from a common ancestor.

In Drosophila, groucho is one of the neurogenic genes that participates in the Notch signalling pathway. The Groucho protein interacts with Hairy-related transcription factors to regulate segmentation, neurogenesis and sex determination. Thus, by analogy to the Drosophila proteins, murine Grg proteins may interact with mammalian Hairy and E(spl) homologues (Hes proteins) and take part in a signalling pathway downstream of murine Notch. We have isolated murine Grg4 cDNAs and examined Grg4 expression during embryogenesis. Transcripts of Grg4 were detected in proliferating epithelial tissues undergoing mesenchymal induction, overlapping with Grg3, Notch1 and Hes1 expression. Grg4 was also expressed in the central nervous system and somites, but in cells adjacent to Grg3-, Notch1-, and Hes1-expressing cells.

Two distinct upstream regulatory domains containing multicopy cellular transcription factor binding sites provide basal repression and inducible enhancer characteristics to the immediate-early IES (US3) promoter from human cytomegalovirus,8764042,10.1128/JVI.70.8.5312-5328.1996,"The US3 gene of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is expressed at immediate-early (IE) times in permissive HF cells, but not in nonpermissive rodent cells, and encodes several proteins that have been reported to have regulatory characteristics, although they are dispensable for growth in cell culture. Both spliced and unspliced forms of US3 IE transcripts are associated with the second of only two known large and complex upstream enhancer domains within the 229-kb HCMV genome, which we refer to as the IES cis-acting control region. Only the 260-bp proximal segment (from -313 to -55) of the 600-bp IES control domain, which contains multicopy NF-kappaB binding sites, proved to be necessary to transfer both high basal expression plus phorbol ester- and okadaic acid-inducible characteristics to heterologous promoters in transient assays in U-937 and K-562 cells. However, the IES control region contains a distinctive 280-bp distal domain, characterized by the presence of seven interspersed repeats of a 10-bp TGTCGCGACA palindromic consensus motif that encompasses a NruI site. This far upstream Nru repeat region (from -596 to -314) imparted up to 20-fold down-regulation effects onto strong basal heterologous promoters as well as onto the IES enhancer plus minimal promoter region in both U-937 and K-562 cells. Functional Nru repressor elements (NREs) could not be generated by multimerizing either the palindromic (P) Nru motifs alone or adjacent degenerate interrupted (I Nru motifs alone. However, multimerized forms of the combined P plus I elements reconstituted the full 20-fold cis-acting down-regulation phenotype of the intact NRE domain. The P and I forms of the Nru elements each bound independently and specifically to related cellular DNA-binding factors to form differently migrating A or B complexes, respectively, whereas the combined P plus I elements bound cooperatively to both the A and B complexes with high affinity. Interestingly, nuclear extracts from U-937, K-562, HeLa, and Vero cells all formed both the A and B NRE binding factor complexes, whereas those from HF cells produced only A complexes, and Raji, HL60, and BALB/c 3T3 cells lacked both types of binding factor complexes. The core pentameric CGACA and CGATA half sites present in both the P and I Nru motifs are related to recently described Drosophila chromosomal insulator binding sites. Therefore, in addition to its cis-repression or silencer characteristics, the NRE domain appears likely to act to shield adjacent segments of the viral genome from the chromatin-reorganizing effects of the IES-inducible enhancer. We speculate that differential expression and regulation of the IES enhancer-controlled US3 protein, either in concert with or separately from the major IE (MIE) enhancer-controlled IE1 and IE2 transactivator proteins, may play a critical role in determining HCMV permissiveness in some cell types and perhaps also in the establishment of or reactivation from latency.",1996,"G S Hayward, Y J Chan, W P Tseng"

In conjunction with the A-box intragenic control region, this upstream transcription-modulatory region functions in the selection mechanism for the site of transcription initiation. Since the transcription-modulatory region directs the position of the start site and the actual sequence of the transcription-modulatory region determines the level of tRNAAsn gene transcription, the possibility is raised that the transcription-modulatory region directs a transcription initiation event similar to open complex formation at procaryotic promoters.",1988,"S J Sharp, A D Garcia, A K Lofquist"
Competitive interactions in Drosophila melanogaster: recurrent selection for aggression and response,3127362,10.1038/hdy.1988.19,"Recurrent selection programmes for both high response and low aggression have been employed in the Texas population of Drosophila melanogaster. Five main points have emerged from this investigation. First, the population exhibits extensive genetic variation for the aggression and response components of competitive interactions which take place in genetically heterogeneous cultures. Secondly, the two components of such interactions, namely aggression and response, can be adjusted by the selection of particular groups of genes. Thirdly, the rapid change in the selected components in the early generations suggests that a considerable amount of additive genetic variation is involved in the control of aggression and response. This is further supported by estimates of the realised heritability taken over the whole selection programme which amount to 0.79 and 0.74 for the low aggression and high response selections respectively. Fourthly, the rapidity with which changes in aggression and response approached plateaux suggests that such changes in the earlier generations are primarily due to the assortment of major chromosomes as units. Fifthly, it was concluded that aggression and response do not behave entirely independently or dependently. The results suggest that a single array of genes might be responsible for the determination of both characters. The observed results would then be consistent with certain of these genes having a much larger effect on aggression than they do on response.",1988,"P Eggleston, M Hemmat"

Drosophila melanogaster was shown to be unable to utilize the sterols with 8(9) and 24(25) double bonds.",1988,"N P Mikhaĭlova, Z A Zhakovskaia, A I Shul'man, T E Ogorodnikova, T A Kamilova"
"jockey, a mobile Drosophila element similar to mammalian LINEs, is transcribed from the internal promoter by RNA polymerase II",2842063,10.1016/s0092-8674(88)80013-8,"The mobile element jockey is similar in structural organization and coding potential to the LINEs of various organisms. As demonstrated here, two polyadenylated jockey transcripts detected at different stages of Drosophila ontogenesis and in cell cultures have the same length as genomic copies of jockey and correspond to the strand containing ORFs. alpha-amanitin experiments indicate that jockey is transcribed by RNA polymerase II. Analysis of both expression of CAT constructions and initiation of transcription in jockey genomic and transfected copies has shown that jockey transcription is controlled by an internal promoter. Inward location of the promoter allows it to be preserved in the course of replication via reverse transcription and accounts for the distribution of jockey and probably other LINEs throughout the genome. This is the first case of an internal promoter described for RNA polymerase II. The comparison of sequences at the beginning of LINE elements in Drosophila allows one to detect possible core sequences.",1988,"Y V Ilyin, L J Mizrokhi, S G Georgieva"
A recombinase from Drosophila melanogaster embryos,3140242,10.1073/pnas.85.20.7481,"We have partially purified a DNA strand-exchange activity (recombinase) from nuclear extracts of Drosophila melanogaster embryos. The protein fraction forms a joint molecule between a circular single-strand DNA and a homologous linear duplex DNA that is resolved from the substrates by agarose gel electrophoresis. A strand-exchange activity can be obtained from nuclear extracts from embryos as old as 24 hr. The activity is similar to that partially purified from human cells [Hsieh, P., Meyn, S.M. & Camerini-Otero, R.D. (1986) Cell 44, 885-894]. It is homology-dependent, requires Mg2+, appears to be directional in that it prefers to displace the 3' end of the noncomplementary strand, and does not require exogenous ATP. Forty nanograms of protein in the partially purified DNA strand-exchange fraction from D. melanogaster embryos can completely convert 50 ng of substrate single-strand DNA into joint molecules in 10 min. In the electron microscope, joint molecules are seen to consist of a circular single-strand DNA molecule attached to only one end of a linear duplex DNA molecule; a displaced strand is also seen. The region of heteroduplex formation can be as long as 600 base pairs. The demonstration of a strand-exchange activity from wild-type D. melanogaster embryos invites analysis of recombination-defective mutants to explore the role of DNA strand exchange in homologous recombination.",1988,"A Eisen, R D Camerini-Otero"
Molecular analysis of alcohol dehydrogenase electromorphs in wild type and transformed Drosophila melanogaster,3124838,10.1016/0006-291x(88)90442-1,"The protein expressed by the alcohol dehydrogenase locus (Adh) in D. melanogaster comprises a small group of electromorphs. We are able to study the expression of these electromorphs by electrophoretic separation and subsequent probing of blots of the separated polypeptides with antiserum for alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). In the present study we have utilized this technique to study and compare the ADH electromorphs in wild type D. melanogaster with D. melanogaster transformants which carry an Adh gene from D. grimshawi, D. hawaiiensis or D. affinidisjuncta and produced functional ADH (10, 19). We have determined that polypeptides are produced by the donor loci in the transformed flies and further show that although the molecular weight of the expressed polypeptides is similar to D. melanogaster electromorphs, the isoelectric points are not similar. Thus this methodology offers the potential to study naturally occurring ADH electromorphs and null alleles independent of enzymatic activity assays.",1988,"B Tedeschi, M D Brennan, M A Batzer, T D Desselle, W R Lee"
The determination of sense organs in Drosophila: interaction of scute with daughterless,28305749,10.1007/BF00398993,"Several genetic loci have been implicated in the formation of the peripheral nervous system during Drosophila embryogenesis. As a first step towards understanding the functional interrelationships between these genes, we have searched for dominant interactions between deficiencies for the achaete-scute complex (AS-C), daughterless (da) and six other regions necessary for peripheral neurogenesis in the embryo. We have found that adult flies doubly heterozygous for deletions of AS-C and of da, or of AS-C and a small region on the fourth chromosome, exhibit characteristic bristle defects, suggesting that these genes cooperate to form sense organs both in the embryo and in the adult.",1988,"Yuh Nung Jan, Christine Dambly-Chaudière, Lily Yen Jan, Alain Ghysen"
Dissecting Fertility Functions of Drosophil a Y Chromosome Genes with CRISPR,32098759,10.1534/genetics.120.302672,"Gene-poor, repeat-rich regions of the genome are poorly understood and have been understudied due to technical challenges and the misconception that they are degenerating ""junk."" Yet multiple lines of evidence indicate these regions may be an important source of variation that could drive adaptation and species divergence, particularly through regulation of fertility. The ∼40 Mb Y chromosome of Drosophila melanoga st er contains only 16 known protein-coding genes, and is highly repetitive and entirely heterochromatic. Most of the genes originated from duplication of autosomal genes and have reduced nonsynonymous substitution rates, suggesting functional constraint. We devised a genetic strategy for recovering and retaining stocks with sterile Y-linked mutations and combined it with CRISPR to create mutants with deletions that disrupt three Y-linked genes. Two genes, PRY and FDY, had no previously identified functions. We found that PRY mutant males are subfertile, but FDY mutant males had no detectable fertility defects. FDY, the newest known gene on the Y chromosome, may have fertility effects that are conditional or too subtle to detect. The third gene, CCY, had been predicted but never formally shown to be required for male fertility. CRISPR targeting and RNA interference of CCY caused male sterility. Surprisingly, however, our CCY mutants were sterile even in the presence of an extra wild-type Y chromosome, suggesting that perturbation of the Y chromosome can lead to dominant sterility. Our approach provides an important step toward understanding the complex functions of the Y chromosome and parsing which functions are accomplished by genes vs. repeat elements.",2020,"Mariana F Wolfner, Andrew G Clark, Steven R Tarrash, Samantha R Sruba, Yassi Hafezi"
Does Divergence in Habitat Breadth Associate with Species Differences in Decision Making in Drosophila Sechellia and Drosophila Simulans?,32397481,10.3390/genes11050528,"Decision making is involved in many behaviors contributing to fitness, such as habitat choice, mate selection, and foraging. Because of this, high decision-making accuracy (i.e., selecting the option most beneficial for fitness) should be under strong selection. However, decision making is energetically costly, often involving substantial time and energy to survey the environment to obtain high-quality information. Thus, for high decision making accuracy to evolve, its benefits should outweigh its costs. Inconsistency in the net benefits of decision making across environments is hypothesized to be an important means for maintaining variation in this trait. However, very little is known about how environmental factors influence the evolution of decision making to produce variation among individuals, genotypes, and species. Here, we compared two recently diverged species of Drosophila differing substantially in habitat breadth and degree of environmental predictability and variability: Drosophila sechellia and Drosophila simulans. We found that the species evolving under higher environmental unpredictability and variability showed higher decision-making accuracy, but not higher environmental sampling.",2020,"Madeline P Burns, Julia B Saltz, Frederick D Cavallaro"
Resource-dependent evolution of female resistance responses to sexual conflict,32055411,10.1002/evl3.153,"Sexual conflict can promote the evolution of dramatic reproductive adaptations as well as resistance to its potentially costly effects. Theory predicts that responses to sexual conflict will vary significantly with resource levels-when scant, responses should be constrained by trade-offs, when abundant, they should not. However, this can be difficult to test because the evolutionary interests of the sexes align upon short-term exposure to novel environments, swamping any selection due to sexual conflict. What is needed are investigations of populations that are well adapted to both differing levels of sexual conflict and resources. Here, we used this approach in a long-term experimental evolution study to track the evolution of female resistance to sexual conflict in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. In resource-rich regimes, high-conflict females evolved resistance to continual exposure to males. There was no difference in baseline survival, consistent with the idea that responses evolving under nutritional abundance experienced no trade-offs with resistance. In the poor resource regimes, the ability of high-conflict females to evolve resistance to males was severely compromised and they also showed lower baseline survival than low-conflict females. This suggested high-conflict females traded off somatic maintenance against any limited resistance they had evolved in response to sexual conflict. Overall, these findings provide experimental support for the hypothesis that evolutionary responses to sexual conflict are critically dependent upon resource levels.",2020,"Wayne G Rostant, Janet S Mason, Tracey Chapman, Jean-Charles de Coriolis"
Drosophila VCP/p97 Mediates Dynein-Dependent Retrograde Mitochondrial Motility in Axons,32373611,10.3389/fcell.2020.00256,"Valosin-containing protein (VCP), also called p97, is an evolutionarily conserved and ubiquitously expressed ATPase with diverse cellular functions. Dominant mutations in VCP are found in a late-onset multisystem degenerative proteinopathy. The neurological manifestations of the disorder include frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In these patients, long motor neuron axons could be particularly susceptible to defects in axonal transport. However, whether VCP has a physiological function in maintaining axonal transport and whether this role is impaired by disease-causing mutations remains elusive. Here, by employing live-imaging methods in Drosophila larval axons and performing genetic interaction experiments, we discover that VCP regulates the axonal transport of mitochondria. Downregulation of VCP enhances the retrograde transport of mitochondria and reduces the density of mitochondria in larval axons. This unidirectional motility phenotype is rescued by removing one copy of the retrograde motor dynein heavy chain (DHC), or elevating Miro which facilitates anterograde mitochondrial movement by interacting with the anterograde motor kinesin heavy chain (KHC). Importantly, Miro upregulation also significantly improves ATP production of VCP mutant larvae. We investigate human VCP pathogenic mutations in our fly system. We find that expressing these mutations affects mitochondrial transport in the same way as knocking down VCP. Our results reveal a new role of VCP in mediating axonal mitochondrial transport, and provide evidence implicating impaired mitochondrial motility in the pathophysiology of VCP-relevant neurodegenerative diseases.",2020,"Xinnan Wang, Ashley E Gonzalez"
Quantification of Macronutrients Intake in a Thermogenetic Neuronal Screen using Drosophila Larvae,32597845,10.3791/61323,"Foraging and feeding behaviors allow animals to access sources of energy and nutrients essential for their development, health, and fitness. Investigating the neuronal regulation of these behaviors is essential for the understanding of the physiological and molecular mechanisms underlying nutritional homeostasis. The use of genetically tractable animal models such as worms, flies, and fish greatly facilitates these types of studies. In the last decade, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has been used as a powerful animal model by neurobiologists investigating the neuronal control of feeding and foraging behaviors. While undoubtedly valuable, most studies examine adult flies. Here, we describe a protocol that takes advantage of the simpler larval nervous system to investigate neuronal substrates controlling feeding behaviors when larvae are exposed to diets differing in their protein and carbohydrates content. Our methods are based on a quantitative colorimetric no-choice feeding assay, performed in the context of a neuronal thermogenetic-activation screen. As a read-out, the amount of food eaten by larvae over a 1 h interval was used when exposed to one of the three dye-labeled diets that differ in their protein to carbohydrates (P:C) ratios. The efficacy of this protocol is demonstrated in the context of a neurogenetic screen in larval Drosophila, by identifying candidate neuronal populations regulating the amount of food eaten in diets of different macronutrient quality. We were also able to classify and group the genotypes tested into phenotypic classes. Besides a brief review of the currently available methods in the literature, the advantages and limitations of these methods are discussed and, also, some suggestions are provided about how this protocol might be adapted to other specific experiments.",2020,"Christen K Mirth, Gonçalo M Poças, Pedro M Domingos"
Tsetse fly rDNA: an analysis of structure and sequence,3029668,10.1093/nar/15.1.15,"A genomic library of Glossina morsitans morsitans (tsetse fly) has been constructed in the phage vector EMBL 4 and a complete rDNA unit isolated by using a D. melanogaster rDNA clone as a probe. The overall organisation is typical of higher eukaryotes, including an intergenic spacer consisting of a subrepeating structure. Atypically, however, the 45S precursor RNA promoter was shown to lie within the last subrepeat by S1 mapping; i.e. the last subrepeat extends 90 bp into the ETS. The sequence of the spacer subrepeats, the ETS and the first 151 nucleotides of the 18S gene was determined. Comparisons with the corresponding regions of other higher eukaryotes, including insects shows that the ETS has completely diverged, raising questions concerning their functional significance and evolutionary retention; depending on the method of alignment, only two short regions of reasonable homology are shared with Drosophila species: a stretch of nucleotides around the transcription initiation site, and AACATA at the NTS-18S gene junction; and the functionally important G at -16, conserved in all other examined species, is displaced no matter what method of alignment is used. These and other features reflect continual processes of change in the rDNA family to which the several functions of the repeating unit need to adjust.",1987,"N C Cross, G A Dover"
Macromolecular interaction and the electrophoretic mobility of esterase-5 from Drosophila pseudoobscura,3606564,10.1007/BF00499322,"Esterase-5 is one of the most polymorphic loci in Drosophila pseudoobscura. Some variants reportedly produce a dimeric enzyme, while a few produce a monomeric form. This paper reports the finding that during electrophoresis ESTERASE-5 exists in a dynamic equilibrium between monomers and dimers, an equilibrium that is dependent on the running temperature of the gels. This is shown by a series of analytical electrophoresis experiments in which the apparent molecular weights of several variants are determined at four different temperatures. Increasing temperatures result in a linear decrease in the logarithm of apparent molecular weights. Macromolecular interactions thus are a significant determinant of EST-5 electrophoretic mobility.",1987,"G K Chambers, E Arnason"
Isolation of a mouse heat-shock gene (hsp68) by recombinational screening,3036653,10.1016/0378-1119(87)90311-8,We have used cloned fragments from a Drosophila melanogaster hsp70 gene and a mouse hsp68 cDNA in recombinational screens of mouse genomic libraries. Using the mouse probe we have isolated two overlapping recombinant lambda phages comprising 22 kb of cloned DNA. Southern analysis has localized the homology with the Drosophila hsp70 coding region to a 2.2-kb fragment containing the mouse heat-shock gene. Insertion accompanying recombinational screening can disrupt interesting sequences; we have overcome this inconvenience by developing a simple one-step genetic selection for phage which have precisely excised the microplasmid probe.,1987,"L A Moran, M D Perry"
"Family of developmentally regulated, maternally expressed Drosophila RNA species detected by a v-myc probe",2580231,10.1128/mcb.5.1.7,"Drosophila melanogaster genomic sequences that hybridize with v-myc have been reported (B.-Z. Shilo and R. A. Weinberg, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 78:6789-6792, 1981). We have detected Drosophila RNA sequences that also hybridize with v-myc. In an attempt to characterize these RNA sequences, we used v-myc hybridization probes to isolate Drosophila genomic segments. None of the Drosophila genomic or cDNA clones that we have isolated hybridize with the 3' exon of v-myc. Preliminary nucleotide sequence analyses have revealed sufficient homology to account for the observed hybridization between v-myc and the Drosophila clones but have failed to detect significant amino acid sequence homology. Thus is seems unlikely that the mRNA sequences or the genomic sequences that we have isolated by hybridization with v-myc represent homologs of the vertebrate myc gene. Despite the lack of structural homology between the cloned Drosophila sequences and v-myc, we have investigated the pattern of expression of those RNA species that hybridize with v-myc. Polyadenylic acid-containing transcripts of 2.7, 2.2, and 1.7 kilobases (kb) in embryos, pupae, adults, and Kc cells and an additional 1.4-kb transcript in adults were complementary to the Drosophila genomic clones and to v-myc. The 1.7- and 2.2-kb transcripts were localized on polyribosomes in Kc cells. The 1.7- and 2.2-kb transcripts were present after 45 min, 2 h, and 4 h of embryonic development, but by 16 h of development their levels had decreased by more than sixfold. During metamorphosis, two peaks of expression of the 1.7- and 2.2-kb transcripts were observed, at 6 and 72 h postpupariation. The 1.4-kb RNA species was first detected at 72 h postpupariation. In adults, the 1.7- and 2.2-kb transcripts were detected only in ovaries in females, whereas the 1.4-kb transcript was present in female nonovarian RNA and in males. These results suggest that the transcripts in early embryos are of maternal origin.",1985,"D Bilodeau-Wentworth, K Madhavan, S C Wadsworth"
