The copia retrotransposon and horizontal transfer in Drosophila willistoni,21450134,10.1017/S0016672310000625,"The copia element is a retrotransposon that is hypothesized to have been horizontally transferred from Drosophila melanogaster to some populations of Drosophila willistoni in Florida. Here we have used PCR and Southern blots to screen for sequences similar to copia element in South American populations of D. willistoni, as well as in strains previously shown to be carriers of the element. We have not found the canonical copia element in any of these populations. Unlike the P element, which invaded the D. melanogaster genome from D. willistoni and quickly spread worldwide, the canonical copia element appears to have transferred in the opposite direction and has not spread. This may be explained by differences in the requirements for transposition and in the host control of transposition.",2011,"V L S Valente, E L S Loreto, C M A Carareto, P M Rubin"
"Drosophila nucleoporin Nup154 controls cell viability, proliferation and nuclear accumulation of Mad transcription factor",21696798,10.1016/j.tice.2011.05.001,"Nuclear Pore Complexes (NPCs) are involved in the regulation of nucleo-cytoplasmic trafficking. Drosophila Nup154 encodes a nucleoporin component of the NPC that is expressed in high proliferating tissues such as germ cells. Hypomorphic mutations in this gene cause male and female sterility and reduction of cell proliferation in the adult fly. Here, we present evidences of a decrease in the number of spermatogonial cells in Nup154 mutants, caused both by increased cell death and reduced cell proliferation. Furthermore, we also found that RNAi-mediated depletion of Nup154 in cultured cells prevented nuclear accumulation of the transcription factor Mothers against Dpp (Mad), suggesting a possible regulatory role for Nup154 in TGF-β signal transduction. These results were confirmed in vivo on mutant testes where we observed a similar defect in the nuclear accumulation of the co-Smad Medea.",2011,"Emilie Quénerch'du, Pier Paolo D'Avino, Giuliano Callaini, Maria Giovanna Riparbelli, Gabriele Colozza, Emilie Montembault"
"Clustering of Alpers disease mutations and catalytic defects in biochemical variants reveal new features of molecular mechanism of the human mitochondrial replicase, Pol γ",21824913,10.1093/nar/gkr618,"Mutations in Pol γ represent a major cause of human mitochondrial diseases, especially those affecting the nervous system in adults and in children. Recessive mutations in Pol γ represent nearly half of those reported to date, and they are nearly uniformly distributed along the length of the POLG1 gene (Human DNA Polymerase gamma Mutation Database); the majority of them are linked to the most severe form of POLG syndrome, Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome. In this report, we assess the structure-function relationships for recessive disease mutations by reviewing existing biochemical data on site-directed mutagenesis of the human, Drosophila and yeast Pol γs, and their homologs from the family A DNA polymerase group. We do so in the context of a molecular model of Pol γ in complex with primer-template DNA, which we have developed based upon the recently solved crystal structure of the apoenzyme form. We present evidence that recessive mutations cluster within five distinct functional modules in the catalytic core of Pol γ. Our results suggest that cluster prediction can be used as a diagnosis-supporting tool to evaluate the pathogenic role of new Pol γ variants.",2011,"Gregory A Farnum, Liliya Euro, Eino Palin, Laurie S Kaguni, Anu Suomalainen"
"Specification and behavior of AMPs, muscle-committed transient Drosophila stem cells",20953150,10.4161/fly.5.1.13710,"During development, transient stem cells play critical roles in the formation of specific tissues. Adult Muscle Precursors (AMPs) are at the origin of all adult Drosophila muscles and as we report here represent a novel population of muscle-committed transient stem cells. Similar to vertebrate muscle stem cells, AMPs keep Notch signaling active and express Enhancer of split m6 (E(spl)m6) gene, a read-out of Notch pathway. To get insights into AMP cell specification we performed a gain-of-function screen and found that the rhomboid-triggered Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) signaling pathway controls both the specification and the subsequent maintenance of AMPs. Our findings are supported by the identification of EGF-secreting cells in the lateral domain and the EGF-dependent regulatory modules that drive expression of the ladybird gene in lateral AMPs. Interestingly, by targeting GFP to the AMP cell membranes we also demonstrated that AMPs send long cellular processes and form a network of interconnected cells. As revealed by laser ablation experiments, the main role of AMP cell connections is to maintain their correct spatial positioning.",2011,"Nicolas Figeac, Teresa Jagla, Krzysztof Jagla, Rajaguru Aradhya, Jean Philippe Da Ponte"
Why flies? Inexpensive public engagement exercises to explain the value of basic biomedical research on Drosophila melanogaster,22139775,10.1152/advan.00045.2011,"Invertebrate model organisms are powerful systems for uncovering conserved principles of animal biology. Despite widespread use in scientific communities, invertebrate research is often severely undervalued by laypeople. Here, we present a set of simple, inexpensive public outreach exercises aimed at explaining to the public why basic research on one particular invertebrate, the insect Drosophila melanogaster, is valuable. First, we designed seven teaching modules that highlight cutting-edge research in Drosophila genetics, metabolism, physiology, and behavior. We then implemented these exercises in a public outreach event that included both children and adults. Quantitative evaluation of participant feedback suggests that these exercises 1) teach principles of animal biology, 2) help laypeople better understand why researchers study fruit flies, and 3) are effective over a wide range of age groups. Overall, this work provides a blueprint for how to use Drosophila as a vehicle for increasing public awareness and appreciation of basic research on genetically tractable insects in particular and invertebrates in general.",2011,"Paola Cognigni, Wendy X W Gu, Barry Denholm, Caroline Fabre, Stefan R Pulver, Maarten Zwart, Vasja Urbancic, Irene Miguel-Aliaga, Lucia Prieto-Godino, Gerit Linneweber"
Transcriptional networks for alcohol sensitivity in Drosophila melanogaster,21270389,10.1534/genetics.110.125229,"Understanding the genetic architecture of polygenic traits requires investigating how complex networks of interacting molecules mediate the effect of genetic variation on organismal phenotypes. We used a combination of P-element mutagenesis and analysis of natural variation in gene expression to predict transcriptional networks that underlie alcohol sensitivity in Drosophila melanogaster. We identified 139 unique P-element mutations (124 in genes) that affect sensitivity or resistance to alcohol exposure. Further analyses of nine of the lines showed that the P-elements affected expression levels of the tagged genes, and P-element excision resulted in phenotypic reversion. The majority of the mutations were in computationally predicted genes or genes with unexpected effects on alcohol phenotypes. Therefore we sought to understand the biological relationships among 21 of these genes by leveraging genetic correlations among genetically variable transcripts in wild-derived inbred lines to predict coregulated transcriptional networks. A total of 32 ""hub"" genes were common to two or more networks associated with the focal genes. We used RNAi-mediated inhibition of expression of focal genes and of hub genes connected to them in the network to confirm their effects on alcohol-related phenotypes. We then expanded the computational networks using the hub genes as foci and again validated network predictions. Iteration of this approach allows a stepwise expansion of the network with simultaneous functional validation. Although coregulated transcriptional networks do not provide information about causal relationships among their constituent transcripts, they provide a framework for subsequent functional studies on the genetic basis of alcohol sensitivity.",2011,"Robert R H Anholt, Trudy F C Mackay, Tatiana V Morozova"
Histaminergic signaling in the central nervous system of Daphnia and a role for it in the control of phototactic behavior,21525325,10.1242/jeb.054486,"Daphnia magna and Daphnia pulex are well-established model organisms in the fields of ecotoxicology and toxicogenomics. Among the many assays used for determining the effects of environmental and anthropogenic stressors on these animals is monitoring for changes in their phototactic behavior. In most arthropods, histamine has been shown to play a key role in the visual system. Currently, nothing is known about histaminergic signaling in either D. magna or D. pulex. Here, a combination of immunohistochemistry and genome mining was used to identify and characterize the histaminergic systems in these daphnids. In addition, a behavioral assay was used to assess the role of histamine in their phototactic response to ultraviolet (UV) light exposure. An extensive network of histaminergic somata, axons and neuropil was identified via immunohistochemistry within the central nervous system of both daphnids, including labeling of putative photoreceptors in the compound eye and projections from these cells to the brain. Mining of the D. pulex genome using known Drosophila melanogaster proteins identified a putative ortholog of histidine decarboxylase (the rate-limiting biosynthetic enzyme for histamine), as well as two putative histamine-gated chloride channels (hclA and hclB orthologs). Exposure of D. magna to cimetidine, an H2 receptor antagonist known to block both hclA and hclB in D. melanogaster, inhibited their negative phototactic response to UV exposure in a reversible, time-dependent manner. Taken collectively, our results show that an extensive histaminergic system is present in Daphnia species, including the visual system, and that this amine is involved in the control of phototaxis in these animals.",2011,"Andrew E Christie, Matthew D McCoole, Kevin N Baer"
Crustacean hematopoiesis and the astakine cytokines,21444913,10.1182/blood-2010-11-320614,"Major contributions to research in hematopoiesis in invertebrate animals have come from studies in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, and the freshwater crayfish, Pacifastacus leniusculus. These animals lack oxygen-carrying erythrocytes and blood cells of the lymphoid lineage, which participate in adaptive immune defense, thus making them suitable model animals to study the regulation of blood cells of the innate immune system. This review presents an overview of crustacean blood cell formation, the role of these cells in innate immunity, and how their synthesis is regulated by the astakine cytokines. Astakines are among the first invertebrate cytokines shown to be involved in hematopoiesis, and they can stimulate the proliferation, differentiation, and survival of hematopoietic tissue cells. The astakines and their vertebrate homologues, prokineticins, share similar functions in hematopoiesis; thus, studies of astakine-induced hematopoiesis in crustaceans may not only advance our understanding of the regulation of invertebrate hematopoiesis but may also provide new evolutionary perspectives about this process.",2011,"Irene Söderhäll, Xionghui Lin"
A conserved developmental patterning network produces quantitatively different output in multiple species of Drosophila,22046143,10.1371/journal.pgen.1002346,"Differences in the level, timing, or location of gene expression can contribute to alternative phenotypes at the molecular and organismal level. Understanding the origins of expression differences is complicated by the fact that organismal morphology and gene regulatory networks could potentially vary even between closely related species. To assess the scope of such changes, we used high-resolution imaging methods to measure mRNA expression in blastoderm embryos of Drosophila yakuba and Drosophila pseudoobscura and assembled these data into cellular resolution atlases, where expression levels for 13 genes in the segmentation network are averaged into species-specific, cellular resolution morphological frameworks. We demonstrate that the blastoderm embryos of these species differ in their morphology in terms of size, shape, and number of nuclei. We present an approach to compare cellular gene expression patterns between species, while accounting for varying embryo morphology, and apply it to our data and an equivalent dataset for Drosophila melanogaster. Our analysis reveals that all individual genes differ quantitatively in their spatio-temporal expression patterns between these species, primarily in terms of their relative position and dynamics. Despite many small quantitative differences, cellular gene expression profiles for the whole set of genes examined are largely similar. This suggests that cell types at this stage of development are conserved, though they can differ in their relative position by up to 3-4 cell widths and in their relative proportion between species by as much as 5-fold. Quantitative differences in the dynamics and relative level of a subset of genes between corresponding cell types may reflect altered regulatory functions between species. Our results emphasize that transcriptional networks can diverge over short evolutionary timescales and that even small changes can lead to distinct output in terms of the placement and number of equivalent cells.",2011,"Charless C Fowlkes, Clara Henriquez, Zeba Wunderlich, David W Knowles, Michael B Eisen, Angela H DePace, Cris L Luengo Hendriks, Lisa Simirenko, Meghan D Bragdon, Miriah Meyer, Soile V E Keränen, Mark D Biggin, Kelly B Eckenrode"
G(o) activation is required for both appetitive and aversive memory acquisition in Drosophila,22190729,10.1101/lm.024802.111,"Heterotrimeric G(o) is an abundant brain protein required for negatively reinforced short-term associative olfactory memory in Drosophila. G(o) is the only known substrate of the S1 subunit of pertussis toxin (PTX) in fly, and acute expression of PTX within the mushroom body neurons (MB) induces a reversible deficit in associative olfactory memory. We demonstrate here that the induction of PTX within the α/β and γ lobe MB neurons leads to impaired memory acquisition without affecting memory stability. The induction of PTX within these MB neurons also leads to a significant defect in an optimized positively reinforced short-term memory paradigm; however, this PTX-induced learning deficit is noticeably less severe than found with the negatively reinforced paradigm. Both negatively and positively reinforced memory phenotypes are rescued by the constitutive expression of G(o)α transgenes bearing the Cys(351)Ile mutation. Since this mutation renders the G(o) molecule insensitive to PTX, the results isolate the effect of PTX on both forms of olfactory associative learning to the inhibition of the G(o) activation.",2011,"Xiao Yang, Gregg Roman, Shixing Zhang, Jacob Ferris, Adrian Madalan"
Characterization of a transgenic short hairpin RNA-induced murine model of Tafazzin deficiency,21091282,10.1089/hum.2010.199,"Barth's syndrome (BTHS) is an X-linked mitochondrial disease that is due to a mutation in the Tafazzin (TAZ) gene. Based on sequence homology, TAZ has been characterized as an acyltransferase involved in the metabolism of cardiolipin (CL), a unique phospholipid almost exclusively located in the mitochondrial inner membrane. Yeast, Drosophila, and zebrafish models have been invaluable in elucidating the role of TAZ in BTHS, but until recently a mammalian model to study the disease has been lacking. Based on in vitro evidence of RNA-mediated TAZ depletion, an inducible short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated TAZ knockdown (TAZKD) mouse model has been developed (TaconicArtemis GmbH, Cologne, Germany), and herein we describe the assessment of this mouse line as a model of BTHS. Upon induction of the TAZ-specific shRNA in vivo, transgenic mouse TAZ mRNA levels were reduced by >89% in cardiac and skeletal muscle. TAZ deficiency led to the absence of tetralineoyl-CL and accumulation of monolyso-CL in cardiac muscle. Furthermore, mitochondrial morphology from cardiac and skeletal muscle was altered. Skeletal muscle mitochondria demonstrated disrupted cristae, and cardiac mitochondria were significantly enlarged and displace neighboring myofibrils. Physiological measurements demonstrated a reduction in isometric contractile strength of the soleus and a reduction in cardiac left ventricular ejection fraction of TAZKD mice compared with control animals. Therefore, the inducible TAZ-deficient model exhibits some of the molecular and clinical characteristics of BTHS patients and may ultimately help to improve our understanding of BTHS-related cardioskeletal myopathy as well as serve as an important tool in developing therapeutic strategies for BTHS.",2011,"Darin J Falk, Cathryn S Mah, Michael Schlame, Alfred S Lewin, Barry J Byrne, Matthew J Toth, Meghan S Soustek"
Cell cycle phase classification in 3D in vivo microscopy of Drosophila embryogenesis,22372955,10.1186/1471-2105-12-S13-S18,"Background: Cell divisions play critical roles in disease and development. The analysis of cell division phenotypes in high content image-based screening and time-lapse microscopy relies on automated nuclear segmentation and classification of cell cycle phases. Automated identification of the cell cycle phase helps biologists quantify the effect of genetic perturbations and drug treatments. Most existing studies have dealt with 2D images of cultured cells. Few, if any, studies have addressed the problem of cell cycle classification in 3D image stacks of intact tissues. Results: We developed a workflow for the automated cell cycle phase classification in 3D time-series image datasets of live Drosophila embryos expressing the chromatin marker histone-GFP. Upon image acquisition by laser scanning confocal microscopy and 3D nuclear segmentation, we extracted 3D intensity, shape and texture features from interphase nuclei and mitotic chromosomes. We trained different classifiers, including support vector machines (SVM) and neural networks, to distinguish between 5 cell cycles phases (Interphase and 4 mitotic phases) and achieved over 90% accuracy. As the different phases occur at different frequencies (58% of samples correspond to interphase), we devised a strategy to improve the identification of classes with low representation. To investigate which features are required for accurate classification, we performed feature reduction and selection. We were able to reduce the feature set from 42 to 9 without affecting classifier performance. We observed a dramatic decrease of classification performance when the training and testing samples were derived from two different developmental stages, the nuclear divisions of the syncytial blastoderm and the cell divisions during gastrulation. Combining samples from both developmental stages produced a more robust and accurate classifier. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that automated cell cycle phase classification, besides 2D images of cultured cells, can also be applied to 3D images of live tissues. We could reduce the initial 3D feature set from 42 to 9 without compromising performance. Robust classifiers of intact animals need to be trained with samples from different developmental stages and cell types. Cell cycle classification in live animals can be used for automated phenotyping and to improve the performance of automated cell tracking.",2011,"Martin Wasser, Tie Hua Du, Wee Choo Puah"
Determining nuclear shape: the role of farnesylated nuclear membrane proteins,21647295,10.4161/nucl.2.1.13992,"Changes in nuclear morphology are observed in diverse developmental processes as well as in pathological conditions. Modification of nuclear membrane and nuclear lamina protein levels results in altered nuclear shapes, as it has been demonstrated in experimental systems ranging from yeast to human cells. The important role of nuclear membrane components in regulating nuclear morphology is additionally highlighted by the abnormally shaped nuclei observed in diseases where nuclear lamina proteins are mutated. Even though the effect of nuclear envelope components on nuclear shape has been thoroughly described, not much is known about the molecular mechanisms that govern these events. In addition to the known role of intermediate filament formation by lamins, here we discuss several mechanisms that might alone or in combination participate in the regulation of nuclear shape observed upon modification of the levels of nuclear membrane and lamina proteins. Based on recent work with the two farnesylated nuclear membrane Drosophila proteins, kugelkern and lamin Dm0, we propose that the direct interaction of farnesylated nuclear membrane proteins with the phospholipid bilayer leads to nuclear envelope deformation. In addition to this mechanism, we suggest that the interaction of nuclear membrane and lamina proteins with cytoskeletal elements and chromatin, and modifications in lipid biosynthesis might also be involved in the formation of abnormally shaped nuclei.",2011,"Jörg Grobhans, Maria Polychronidou"
TRIM-9 functions in the UNC-6/UNC-40 pathway to regulate ventral guidance,21338947,10.1016/j.jcg.2010.12.004,"TRIpartite Motif (TRIM) family proteins are ring finger domain-containing, multi-domain proteins implicated in many biological processes. Members of the TRIM-9/C-I subfamily of TRIM proteins, including TRIM-9, MID1 and MID2, have neuronal functions and are associated with neurological diseases. To explore whether the functions of C-I TRIM proteins are conserved in invertebrates, we analyzed Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila trim-9 mutants. C. elegans trim-9 mutants exhibit defects in the ventral guidance of hermaphrodite specific neuron (HSN) and the touch neuron AVM. Further genetic analyses indicate that TRIM-9 participates in the UNC-6-UNC-40 attraction pathway. Asymmetric distribution of UNC-40 during HSN development is normal in trim-9 mutants. However, the asymmetric localization of MIG-10, a downstream effector of UNC-40, is abolished in trim-9 mutants. These results suggest that TRIM-9 functions upstream of MIG-10 in the UNC-40 pathway. Moreover, we showed that TRIM-9 exhibits E3 ubiquitin ligase activity in vitro and this activity is important for TRIM-9 function in vivo. Additionally, we found that Drosophila trim-9 is required for the midline attraction of a group of sensory neuron axons. Over-expression of the Netrin/UNC-6 receptor Frazzled suppresses the guidance defects in trim-9 mutants. Our study reveals an evolutionarily conserved function of TRIM-9 in the UNC-40/Frazzled-mediated UNC-6/Netrin attraction pathway.",2011,"Xun Huang, Qi Xie, Song Song, Haiyang Chen, Junfeng Bi, Qinglan Ge, Xia Li, Jinbo Wang, Sanyuan Tang"
Precise spatiotemporal control of optogenetic activation using an acousto-optic device,22174813,10.1371/journal.pone.0028468,"Light activation and inactivation of neurons by optogenetic techniques has emerged as an important tool for studying neural circuit function. To achieve a high resolution, new methods are being developed to selectively manipulate the activity of individual neurons. Here, we report that the combination of an acousto-optic device (AOD) and single-photon laser was used to achieve rapid and precise spatiotemporal control of light stimulation at multiple points in a neural circuit with millisecond time resolution. The performance of this system in activating ChIEF expressed on HEK 293 cells as well as cultured neurons was first evaluated, and the laser stimulation patterns were optimized. Next, the spatiotemporally selective manipulation of multiple neurons was achieved in a precise manner. Finally, we demonstrated the versatility of this high-resolution method in dissecting neural circuits both in the mouse cortical slice and the Drosophila brain in vivo. Taken together, our results show that the combination of AOD-assisted laser stimulation and optogenetic tools provides a flexible solution for manipulating neuronal activity at high efficiency and with high temporal precision.",2011,"Yanmeng Guo, Xiaohui Zhang, Peipei Song, Zuoren Wang, Shaoqun Zeng, Yiding Li, Kaiyu Wang, Yafeng Liu"
Active depletion of host cell inhibitor-of-apoptosis proteins triggers apoptosis upon baculovirus DNA replication,21653668,10.1128/JVI.00667-11,"Apoptosis is an important antivirus defense by virtue of its impact on virus multiplication and pathogenesis. To define molecular mechanisms by which viruses are detected and the apoptotic response is initiated, we examined the antiviral role of host inhibitor-of-apoptosis (IAP) proteins in insect cells. We report here that the principal IAPs, DIAP1 and SfIAP, of the model insects Drosophila melanogaster and Spodoptera frugiperda, respectively, are rapidly depleted and thereby inactivated upon infection with the apoptosis-inducing baculovirus Autographa californica multicapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV). Virus-induced loss of these host IAPs triggered caspase activation and apoptotic death. Elevation of IAP levels by ectopic expression repressed caspase activation. Loss of host IAP in both species was triggered by AcMNPV DNA replication. By using selected inhibitors, we found that virus-induced IAP depletion was mediated in part by the proteasome but not by caspase cleavage. Consistent with this conclusion, mutagenic disruption of the SfIAP RING motif, which acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, stabilized SfIAP during infection. Importantly, SfIAP was also stabilized upon the removal of its 99-residue N-terminal leader, which serves as a critical determinant of IAP turnover. These data indicated that a host pathway initiated by virus DNA replication and acting through instability motifs embedded within IAP triggers IAP depletion and thereby causes apoptosis. Taken together, the results of our study suggest that host modulation of cellular IAP levels is a conserved mechanism by which insects mount an apoptotic antiviral response. Thus, host IAPs may function as critical sentinels of virus invasion in insects.",2011,"Rianna Vandergaast, Paul D Friesen, Kimberly L W Schultz, Rebecca J Cerio"
Synaptonemal complex-dependent centromeric clustering and the initiation of synapsis in Drosophila oocytes,22036182,10.1016/j.cub.2011.09.044,"The pairing of homologous chromosomes and the intimate synapsis of the paired homologs by the synaptonemal complex (SC) are essential for subsequent meiotic processes including recombination and chromosome segregation. Here we show that the centromere clustering plays an important role in initiating homolog synapsis during meiosis in Drosophila females. Although centromeres are not clustered prior to the onset of meiosis, all four pairs of centromeres are actively clustered into one or two masses during early meiotic prophase. Within the 16-cell cyst, centromeric clustering appears to define the first step in the initiation of synapsis. Clustering is restricted to the nuclei that form the SC and is dependent on all known SC proteins. Surprisingly, both centromeric clusters and the SC components associated with them persist long after the disassembly of the euchromatic SC at the end of pachytene. The initiation of homologous recombination through the formation of programmed double-strand breaks (DSBs) is not required for either the formation or the maintenance of the centromeric clusters. Our data support a view in which the SC-mediated clustering at the centromeres is the initiating event for meiotic synapsis.",2011,"Cláudio E Sunkel, Cathleen M Lake, Eurico Morais-de-Sá, R Scott Hawley, Satomi Takeo"
Wind speed affects prey-catching behaviour in an orb web spider,21993581,10.1007/s00114-011-0854-4,"Wind has previously been shown to influence the location and orientation of spider web sites and also the geometry and material composition of constructed orb webs. We now show that wind also influences components of prey-catching behaviour within the web. A small wind tunnel was used to generate different wind speeds. Araneus diadematus ran more slowly towards entangled Drosophila melanogaster in windy conditions, which took less time to escape the web. This indicates a lower capture probability and a diminished overall predation efficiency for spiders at higher wind speeds. We conclude that spiders' behaviour of taking down their webs as wind speed increases may therefore not be a response only to possible web damage.",2011,"Thomas Hesselberg, Joe Turner, Fritz Vollrath"
Live imaging of the Drosophila spermatogonial stem cell niche reveals novel mechanisms regulating germline stem cell output,21752931,10.1242/dev.065797,"Adult stem cells modulate their output by varying between symmetric and asymmetric divisions, but have rarely been observed in living intact tissues. Germline stem cells (GSCs) in the Drosophila testis are anchored to somatic hub cells and were thought to exclusively undergo oriented asymmetric divisions, producing one stem cell that remains hub-anchored and one daughter cell displaced out of the stem cell-maintaining micro-environment (niche). We developed extended live imaging of the Drosophila testis niche, allowing us to track individual germline cells. Surprisingly, new wild-type GSCs are generated in the niche during steady-state tissue maintenance by a previously undetected event we term 'symmetric renewal', where interconnected GSC-daughter cell pairs swivel such that both cells contact the hub. We also captured GSCs undergoing direct differentiation by detaching from the hub. Following starvation-induced GSC loss, GSC numbers are restored by symmetric renewals. Furthermore, upon more severe (genetically induced) GSC loss, both symmetric renewal and de-differentiation (where interconnected spermatogonia fragment into pairs while moving towards then establishing contact with the hub) occur simultaneously to replenish the GSC pool. Thus, stereotypically oriented stem cell divisions are not always correlated with an asymmetric outcome in cell fate, and changes in stem cell output are governed by altered signals in response to tissue requirements.",2011,"X Rebecca Sheng, Erika Matunis"
Sweet taste signaling and the formation of memories of energy sources,22144950,10.3389/fnsys.2011.00099,"The last decade witnessed remarkable advances in our knowledge of the gustatory system. Application of molecular biology techniques not only determined the identity of the membrane receptors and downstream effectors that mediate sweetness, but also uncovered the overall logic of gustatory coding in the periphery. However, while the ability to taste sweet may offer the obvious advantage of eliciting rapid and robust intake of sugars, a number of recent studies demonstrate that sweetness is neither necessary nor sufficient for the formation of long-lasting preferences for stimuli associated with sugar intake. Furthermore, uncoupling sweet taste from ensuing energy utilization may disrupt body weight control. This minireview examines recent experiments performed in both rodents and Drosophila revealing the taste-independent rewarding properties of metabolizable sugars. Taken together, these experiments demonstrate the reinforcing actions of sugars in the absence of sweet taste signaling and point to a critical role played by dopamine systems in translating metabolic sensing into behavioral action. From a mechanistic viewpoint, current evidence favors the concept that gastrointestinal and post-absorptive signals contribute in parallel to sweet-independent sugar acceptance and dopamine release.",2011,Ivan E de Araujo
A Bmp/Admp regulatory circuit controls maintenance and regeneration of dorsal-ventral polarity in planarians,21295483,10.1016/j.cub.2011.01.017,"Animal embryos have diverse anatomy and vary greatly in size. It is therefore remarkable that a common signaling pathway, BMP signaling, controls development of the dorsoventral (DV) axis throughout the Bilateria. In vertebrates, spatially opposed expression of the BMP family proteins Bmp4 and Admp (antidorsalizing morphogenetic protein) can promote restoration of DV pattern following tissue removal. bmp4 orthologs have been identified in all three groups of the Bilateria (deuterostomes, ecdysozoans, and lophotrochozoans). By contrast, the absence of admp orthologs in ecdysozoans such as Drosophila and C. elegans has suggested that a regulatory circuit of oppositely expressed bmp4 and admp genes represents a deuterostome-specific innovation. Here we describe the existence of spatially opposed bmp and admp expression in a protostome. An admp ortholog (Smed-admp) is expressed ventrally and laterally in adult Schmidtea mediterranea planarians, opposing the dorsal-pole expression of Smed-bmp4. Smed-admp is required for regeneration following parasagittal amputation. Furthermore, Smed-admp promotes Smed-bmp4 expression and Smed-bmp4 inhibits Smed-admp expression, generating a regulatory circuit that buffers against perturbations of Bmp signaling. These results suggest that a Bmp/Admp regulatory circuit is a central feature of the Bilateria, used broadly for the establishment, maintenance, and regeneration of the DV axis.",2011,"Michael A Gaviño, Peter W Reddien"
"Crystal structure of Ssu72, an essential eukaryotic phosphatase specific for the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, in complex with a transition state analogue",21204787,10.1042/BJ20101471,"Reversible phosphorylation of the CTD (C-terminal domain) of the eukaryotic RNA polymerase II largest subunit represents a critical regulatory mechanism during the transcription cycle and mRNA processing. Ssu72 is an essential phosphatase conserved in eukaryotes that dephosphorylates phosphorylated Ser5 of the CTD heptapeptide. Its function is implicated in transcription initiation, elongation and termination, as well as RNA processing. In the present paper we report the high resolution X-ray crystal structures of Drosophila melanogaster Ssu72 phosphatase in the apo form and in complex with an inhibitor mimicking the transition state of phosphoryl transfer. Ssu72 facilitates dephosphorylation of the substrate through a phosphoryl-enzyme intermediate, as visualized in the complex structure of Ssu72 with the oxo-anion compound inhibitor vanadate at a 2.35 Å (1 Å=0.1 nm) resolution. The structure resembles the transition state of the phosphoryl transfer with vanadate exhibiting a trigonal bi-pyramidal geometry covalently bonded to the nucleophilic cysteine residue. Interestingly, the incorporation of oxo-anion compounds greatly stabilizes a flexible loop containing the general acid, as detected by an increase of melting temperature of Ssu72 detected by differential scanning fluorimetry. The Ssu72 structure exhibits a core fold with a similar topology to that of LMWPTPs [low-molecular-mass PTPs (protein tyrosine phosphatases)], but with an insertion of a unique 'cap' domain to shelter the active site from the solvent with a deep groove in between where the CTD substrates bind. Mutagenesis studies in this groove established the functional roles of five residues (Met17, Pro46, Asp51, Tyr77 and Met85) that are essential specifically for substrate recognition.",2011,"Yan Zhang, Yong Zhang, Mengmeng Zhang"

Parasitized hosts can be identified on the basis of various physical or chemical marks present on the surface or inside the hosts or their surroundings in the case of concealed host. Here we studied host discrimination behaviors of females of a certain population of Pachycrepoideus vindemmiae, a solitary ectoparasitoid, which are known to reject large-sized parasitized hosts after an abdominal examination of their surface. We first investigated females' recognition behaviors of host parasitism status when confronted to small-sized hosts (Drosophila melanogaster pupae) as host size may influence the use of different cues for host selection. We showed that, in such a situation, females also discriminate parasitized hosts after an external host exploration with the tip of their ovipositor sheath (third valvulae). We then described the sense organs present on the different parts of the ovipositor by means of scanning and transmission electron microscopy analysis. As the extremity of the third valvulae bears only one type of sensilla that appears to be chemoreceptors, we considered these sensilla as highly likely to be involved in host discrimination in P. vindemmiae. To our knowledge, this is the first time that receptors located on the ovipositor sheath are described as implicated in host discrimination in parasitoid wasps. We discuss potential chemical markers that might be detected by these receptors.",2011,"Sonia Dourlot, Marlène Goubault, Anne Le Ralec, Chrystelle Paty, Anne Marie Cortesero, Julie Fourrier"
Human disease models in Drosophila melanogaster and the role of the fly in therapeutic drug discovery,21415126,10.1124/pr.110.003293,"The common fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, is a well studied and highly tractable genetic model organism for understanding molecular mechanisms of human diseases. Many basic biological, physiological, and neurological properties are conserved between mammals and D. melanogaster, and nearly 75% of human disease-causing genes are believed to have a functional homolog in the fly. In the discovery process for therapeutics, traditional approaches employ high-throughput screening for small molecules that is based primarily on in vitro cell culture, enzymatic assays, or receptor binding assays. The majority of positive hits identified through these types of in vitro screens, unfortunately, are found to be ineffective and/or toxic in subsequent validation experiments in whole-animal models. New tools and platforms are needed in the discovery arena to overcome these limitations. The incorporation of D. melanogaster into the therapeutic discovery process holds tremendous promise for an enhanced rate of discovery of higher quality leads. D. melanogaster models of human diseases provide several unique features such as powerful genetics, highly conserved disease pathways, and very low comparative costs. The fly can effectively be used for low- to high-throughput drug screens as well as in target discovery. Here, we review the basic biology of the fly and discuss models of human diseases and opportunities for therapeutic discovery for central nervous system disorders, inflammatory disorders, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes. We also provide information and resources for those interested in pursuing fly models of human disease, as well as those interested in using D. melanogaster in the drug discovery process.",2011,"Charles D Nichols, Udai Bhan Pandey"
GC content around splice sites affects splicing through pre-mRNA secondary structures,21281513,10.1186/1471-2164-12-90,"Background: Alternative splicing increases protein diversity by generating multiple transcript isoforms from a single gene through different combinations of exons or through different selections of splice sites. It has been reported that RNA secondary structures are involved in alternative splicing. Here we perform a genomic study of RNA secondary structures around splice sites in humans (Homo sapiens), mice (Mus musculus), fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster), and nematodes (Caenorhabditis elegans) to further investigate this phenomenon. Results: We observe that GC content around splice sites is closely associated with the splice site usage in multiple species. RNA secondary structure is the possible explanation, because the structural stability difference among alternative splice sites, constitutive splice sites, and skipped splice sites can be explained by the GC content difference. Alternative splice sites tend to be GC-enriched and exhibit more stable RNA secondary structures in all of the considered species. In humans and mice, splice sites of first exons and long exons tend to be GC-enriched and hence form more stable structures, indicating the special role of RNA secondary structures in promoter proximal splicing events and the splicing of long exons. In addition, GC-enriched exon-intron junctions tend to be overrepresented in tissue-specific alternative splice sites, indicating the functional consequence of the GC effect. Compared with regions far from splice sites and decoy splice sites, real splice sites are GC-enriched. We also found that the GC-content effect is much stronger than the nucleotide-order effect to form stable secondary structures. Conclusion: All of these results indicate that GC content is related to splice site usage and it may mediate the splicing process through RNA secondary structures.",2011,"Jing Zhang, C C Jay Kuo, Liang Chen"
Gene dosage studies of a temperature sensitive Abruptex mutation of the Notch locus of Drosophila melanogaster,2501239,10.1111/j.1601-5223.1989.tb00439.x,"Gene dosage studies of a temperature sensitive Abruptex mutation of the Notch locus of Drosophila melanogaster revealed, firstly, that hemizygous females were lethal at all temperatures studied, while hemizygous males were subvital at 18 degrees C, semilethal at 25 degrees C, and lethal at 29 degrees C. This is due to dosage compensation of the Notch locus. Secondly, it was observed that in general an increasing dose of the wild allele decreased the expression of Abruptex at all temperatures. An exception was the Axtsl/Axtsl/ + genotype, which was more expressed than Axtsl/Axtsl at low temperatures. This suggests antimorphism as the most likely mode of action of the temperature sensitive Abruptex mutation. Thirdly, it was observed that the expression of Abruptex phenotype increased from 18 degrees C to 25 degrees C but decreased from 25 degrees C to 29 degrees C if the wild type allele was involved in the genotype. This suggests that the gene product of the temperature sensitive Abruptex allele loses its function at high temperatures. The putative antimorphic mode of action of the temperature sensitive Abruptex mutation suggests that the Notch gene product interacts with products of other neurogenic loci or with itself.",1989,"P Portin, M Sirén"

The sequence of the coding region for the Sod gene as well as 413 bp of the 5'-untranslated region, 247 bp of the 3'-flanking DNA, and the single 725-bp intron have been determined [Seto et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 15 (1987) 10601]. The sequence reveals an additional C-terminal triplet coding for valine not found in the mature SOD protein. The nucleotide sequence of the coding region has 56% and 57% homology compared with the corresponding human and rat Sod genes, respectively. The codon usage for the Sod gene is similar to that found for other Drosophila genes. The gene hybridizes to position 68A4-9 on Drosophila polytene chromosomes.

Fine structural ribonucleoprotein components of the cell nucleus visualized after spreading and high resolution autoradiography,2482153,10.1007/BF00327309,"The fine structure of the nuclear components was studied following mild lysis of mouse or Drosophila tissue culture cells and spreading of nuclear material. Particular attention was paid to nuclear ribonucleoprotein (RNP) constituents, which were analysed by high resolution autoradiography after [3H]uridine pulse labelling of cells. Comparison with the labelling kinetics of various in situ nuclear RNP constituents described previously suggests strong similarities between in situ constituents and structures observed within spread nuclear components. The present observations suggest that the nucleolar dense fibrillar component, shown previously in ultrathin sections of [3H]uridine-labelled intact cells as carrying rapidly labelled pre-rRNA, in fact consists of highly compacted transcribing ribosomal genes. The growing RNP fibrils appearing in transcription complexes of extranucleolar active genes and the in situ observed perichromatin fibrils also show the same labelling properties. This confirms that the two structures indeed represent the same nucleoplasmic constituents. As for the nuclear structures involved in post-transcriptional events, our observations demonstrate the occurrence of a rapidly labelled RNP fibro-granular network. Its granular elements correspond, in size and perichromatin location, to the perichromatin granules seen in the situ preparations and suggest similarities between the two constituents. The results are discussed in the light of other data providing information on the role of various nuclear structural constituents.",1989,"M E Hughes, S Fakan"
Stage-specific phosphorylation of the fushi tarazu protein during Drosophila development,2743978,,"The regulatory protein encoded by the fushi tarazu (ftz) gene is expressed during three different stages of Drosophila embryogenesis in three different developing tissues. Previously, we demonstrated that ftz protein ectopically expressed throughout developing embryos under the control of an hsp70 heat shock promoter is heavily modified. Here we show that these negatively charged isoforms of the protein are the result of phosphorylation at as many as 16 sites. Phosphate groups could be removed in vitro by treatment with various phosphatases and could be added in vivo by incubating embryo-derived cells or nuclei in the presence of [32P]-orthophosphate. Phosphoamino acid analysis of immunoprecipitated ftz protein yielded both phosphoserines and phosphothreonines at a ratio of approximately 1:1. Interestingly we find that the endogenous ftz protein is also phosphorylated at multiple sites and that different subsets of the phosphoisoforms occur during different stages of development.",1989,"H M Krause, W J Gehring"
The protein encoded by a murine male germ cell-specific transcript is a putative ATP-dependent RNA helicase,2720782,10.1016/0092-8674(89)90125-6,"The murine PL10 cDNA corresponds to a transcript expressed only in the male germ line.

The deduced protein is shown to be highly homologous to the murine translation initiation factor eIF-4A and to other proteins that are also homologous to eIF-4A, including the Drosophila protein vasa. By consensus sequence conservation and comparison of secondary structure predictions, putative mononucleotide binding and DNA/RNA binding domains are proposed to be shared by all these proteins. Taken together, these results suggest a helicase function for PL10 protein similar to that of eIF-4A and suggests its possible role in a key step of the spermatogenic process.

Persistence of major nuclear envelope antigens in an envelope-like structure during mitosis in Drosophila melanogaster embryos,2517292,,"Using monoclonal antibodies, we followed the fate of three different nuclear envelope proteins during mitosis in Drosophila early embryos by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. Two of these proteins, lamin and otefin, a newly characterized nuclear envelope polypeptide with an apparent Mr of 53,000, are apparently present in an envelope-like structure that is present throughout mitosis. Immunoelectron microscopy of interphase nuclei indicates that otefin, like lamin, is not a component of nuclear pore complexes. In contrast with lamin and otefin, gp188, a putative pore complex component, was completely redistributed through the surrounding cytoplasm during prophase in comparable early embryo specimens and was present in an envelope only in interphase. Together with previous morphological studies by other workers, these data suggest that the entire mitotic apparatus including condensed chromosomes and spindle is enclosed by an envelope throughout mitosis during early embryogenesis in Drosophila. This 'spindle envelope', as it has been named by others, contains both lamin and otefin but probably not pore complex proteins.",1989,"P A Fisher, A Harel, S Nainudel-Epszteyn, E Zlotkin, Y Gruenbaum, N Feinstein"
Regulation of HSP70 synthesis by messenger RNA degradation,2519613,10.1091/mbc.1.1.135,"When Drosophila cells are heat shocked, hsp70 messenger RNA (mRNA) is stable and is translated at high efficiencies. During recovery from heat shock, hsp70 synthesis is repressed and its messenger RNA (mRNA) is degraded in a highly regulated fashion. Dramatic differences in the timing of repression and degradation are observed after heat treatments of different severities. The 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the hsp70 mRNA was sufficient to transfer this regulated degradation to heterologous mRNAs. Altering the translational efficiency of the message or changing its natural translation-termination site did not alter its pattern of regulation, although in some cases it changed the absolute rate of degradation. We have previously shown that hsp70 mRNA is very unstable when it is expressed at normal growth temperatures (from a metallothionein promoter). We report here that the 3' untranslated region of the hsp70 mRNA is responsible for this instability as well. We postulate that a mechanism for degrading hsp70 mRNA pre-exists in Drosophila cells, that it is inactivated by heat shock and that it is the reactivation of this mechanism that is responsible for hsp70 repression during recovery. This degradation system may be the same as that used by other unstable mRNAs.",1989,"S Lindquist, R B Petersen"

This antibody gives positive immunofluorescence over the entire length of native D. melanogaster polytene chromosomes isolated from salivary glands by microdissection at physiological pH and ionic strength. Bands, interbands and puffs are all seen to contain H1. The immunofluorescence over puffs, albeit lower than that over bands and interbands, indicates that chromatin decondensation can occur without complete loss of H1 in these structures. The reaction of the antibody with bands suggests that the segment of the C-terminal tail containing the epitope may be exposed in the condensed 30 nm chromatin filament.",1989,"P A Underwood, H M Geysen, G Tribbick, F Watt, C M Wilson, T Fifis, R J Hill, J O Thomas"

The excision of a mispaired nucleotide occurs at a significantly greater rate than excision of a correctly paired nucleotide and, under conditions of DNA synthesis, hydrolysis of a mispaired terminal nucleotide occurs prior to primer extension. The 3'----5' exonuclease copurifies quantitatively with DNA polymerase gamma and cosediments with the nearly homogeneous enzyme under native conditions.

Ribosomal protein L7a is encoded by a gene (Surf-3) within the tightly clustered mouse surfeit locus,2648130,10.1128/mcb.9.1.224,"The mouse Surfeit locus, which contains a cluster of at least four genes (Surf-1 to Surf-4), is unusual in that adjacent genes are separated by no more than 73 base pairs (bp). The heterogeneous 5' ends of Surf-1 and Surf-2 are separated by only 15 to 73 bp, the 3' ends of Surf-1 and Surf-3 are only 70 bp apart, and the 3' ends of Surf-2 and Surf-4 overlap by 133 bp. This very tight clustering suggests a cis interaction between adjacent Surfeit genes. The Surf-3 gene (which could code for a basic polypeptide of 266 amino acids) is a highly expressed member of a pseudogene-containing multigene family. By use of an anti-peptide serum (against the C-terminal nine amino acids of the putative Surf-3 protein) for immunofluorescence and immunoblotting of mouse cell components and by in vitro translation of Surf-3 cDNA hybrid-selected mRNA, the Surf-3 gene product was identified as a 32-kilodalton ribosomal protein located in the 60S ribosomal subunit. From its subunit location, gel migration, and homology with a limited rat ribosomal peptide sequence, the Surf-3 gene was shown to encode the mouse L7a ribosomal protein. The Surf-3 gene is highly conserved through evolution and was detected by nucleic acid hybridization as existing in multiple copies (multigene families) in other mammals and as one or a few copies in birds, Xenopus, Drosophila, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The Surf-3 C-terminal anti-peptide serum detects a 32-kilodalton protein in other mammals, birds, and Xenopus but not in Drosophila and S. pombe.

To explore the nature of this complementation, the adult phenotypes of several different en1/enlethal transheterozygotes were compared with the corresponding patterns of engrailed protein expression in third larval instar imaginal discs (determined by immunofluorescence). Transheterozygotes of en1 and deletions of the locus (enDf) typically show slight complementation in the adult cuticle. The pattern of engrailed protein expression in some en1/enDf wing discs is indistinguishable from en1 homozygotes, but in others the pattern is nearly normal. en1/enDf leg discs appear to express engrailed protein normally. Transheterozygotes of en1 and EMS-induced, cytologically normal enlethal alleles have almost normal adult cuticle phenotypes and also exhibit normal patterns of engrailed protein expression in all of the thoracic imaginal discs. Surprisingly, the intensity of anti-engrailed staining in these discs is elevated relative to that in wild type. en2 is an unusual lethal allele in that it does not complement either the en1 adult cuticle phenotype or the protein expression pattern in imaginal discs. Moreover, the cytologically normal enlethal alleles also complement en2, at least partially. Both wing and leg imaginal discs from en2/enlethal transheterozygotes show abnormal patterns of engrailed protein expression.

Co-localization of Polycomb protein and GAGA factor on regulatory elements responsible for the maintenance of homeotic gene expression,9218803,10.1093/emboj/16.12.3621,"The Polycomb group and trithorax group genes of Drosophila are required for maintaining the differential expression state of developmental regulators, such as the homeotic genes, in a stable and heritable manner throughout development. The Polycomb group genes have been suggested to act by regulating higher order chromatin and packaging repressed chromosomal domains in a heterochromatin-like structure. We have mapped, at high resolution, the distribution of Polycomb protein on the bithorax complex of Drosophila tissue culture cells, using an improved formaldehyde cross-linking and immunoprecipitation technique. Polycomb protein is not distributed homogeneously on the regulatory regions of the repressed Ultrabithorax and abdominal-A genes, but is highly enriched at discrete sequence elements, many of which coincide with previously mapped Polycomb group response elements (PREs). Our results further suggest that Polycomb protein spreads locally over a few kilobases of DNA surrounding PREs, perhaps to stabilize silencing complexes. GAGA factor/Trithorax-like, a member of the trithorax group, is also bound at those PREs which contain GAGA consensus-binding sites. Two modes of binding can be distinguished: a high level binding to elements in the regulatory domain of the expressed Abdominal-B gene, and a low level of binding to Polycomb-bound PREs in the inactive domains of the bithorax complex.

Furthermore, Pnr and Ush are found to heterodimerize through the amino-terminal zinc finger of Pnr and when associated with Ush, the transcriptional activity of Pnr is lost.

Specific and redundant functions of Gli2 and Gli3 zinc finger genes in skeletal patterning and development,9006072,,"The correct patterning of vertebrate skeletal elements is controlled by inductive interactions. Two vertebrate hedgehog proteins, Sonic hedgehog and Indian hedgehog, have been implicated in skeletal development. During somite differentiation and limb development, Sonic hedgehog functions as an inductive signal from the notochord, floor plate and zone of polarizing activity. Later in skeletogenesis, Indian hedgehog functions as a regulator of chondrogenesis during endochondral ossification. The vertebrate Gli zinc finger proteins are putative transcription factors that respond to Hedgehog signaling. In Drosophila, the Gli homolog cubitus interruptus is required for the activation of hedgehog targets and also functions as a repressor of hedgehog expression. We show here that Gli2 mutant mice exhibit severe skeletal abnormalities including cleft palate, tooth defects, absence of vertebral body and intervertebral discs, and shortened limbs and sternum. Interestingly, Gli2 and Gli3 (C.-c. Hui and A. L. Joyner (1993).

The enzymes in L. cuprina and D. melanogaster correspond to the naphthyl acetate hydrolyzing E3 and EST23 isozymes of those species. These and previously published data suggest that the ali-esterases of all three species are orthologous. Strains of L. cuprina fall into four groups on the basis of quantitative determinations of their ali-estesterase, OP hydrolase, and malathion carboxylesterase activities and these groups correspond to their status with respect to two types of OP resistance. Strains susceptible to OP's have high ali-esterase, low OP hydrolase, and intermediate MCE activities; those resistant to malathion but not diazinon have low ali-esterase, intermediate OP hydrolase, and high MCE activities; those resistant to diazinon but not malathion have low ali-esterase, high OP hydrolase, and low MCE activities; those resistant to both OPs have low ali-esterase, high OP hydrolase, and high MCE activities. The correlated changes among the three biochemical and two resistance phenotypes suggest that they are all properties of one gene/enzyme system; three major allelic variants of that system explain OP susceptibility and the two types of OP resistance.

Only one exon encodes the repeated motifs. A comparison of introns positions, intron classes and intron/exon boundaries in the Drosophila gene and in its human counterpart is compatible with the intron-early hypothesis presiding, at least in part, to the evolution of the synthetases. The full-length fly protein is encoded by a 6.1-kb mRNA which is expressed throughout development. In addition, a shorter transcript encompasses the 3'-end of the cDNA and it is especially abundant in 5-10-h embryos until the first larval stage. Expression of these two mRNAs seems to be controlled by two independent promoters. The 6.1-kb mRNA promoter is probably localized in the 5'-end of the gene. The small mRNA promoter resides in the 4th intron and evidence is provided that the mRNA encodes only the domain corresponding to prolyl-tRNA synthetase and is functional in vivo.

Molecular genetic elucidation of the tripartite structure of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe 72 kDa TFIID subunit which contains a WD40 structural motif,9224658,10.1046/j.1365-2443.1997.1180316.x,"Background: The multisubunit general transcription factor termed TFIID is comprised of the TATA box DNA binding protein TBP and several TBP-associated factors termed TAFs. Current arguments regarding the mechanisms of regulation of transcription contend that TFIID makes multiple specific protein-protein interactions with numerous protein factors, and that these interactions are important for the regulation of transcriptional initiation. TAFs contain a variety of potential structural motifs and it has been speculated that these motifs participate directly in TAF function. However, to date the physiological significance of these putative structural motifs has not been systematically analysed in vivo. Results: The essential gene encoding the Schizosaccharomyces pombe 72 kDa TFIID subunit is termed taf72+, which contains WD40 repeats, was cloned and sequenced. A comparison of the primary structure of this gene with its Drosophila and S. cerevisiae counterparts suggests the presence of regions that might play a role in TFIID function, due to the fact that significant portions of the sequences are highly conserved. Complementation analyses of a series of deletion mutants of this gene revealed that the most evolutionarily conserved regions of taf72+, including the WD40 repeats, are in fact indispensable for the viability. Conclusions: The 72 kDa subunit of S. pombe TFIID, which contains putative WD40 repeats, consists of three distinct functional domains separated by intervening regions. The functional significance of the WD40 repeats is demonstrated by this in vivo study.",1997,"T Yamamoto, P A Weil, M Horikoshi, D Poon"
A valine421 to methionine mutation in IS6 of the hscp voltage-gated sodium channel associated with pyrethroid resistance in Heliothis virescens F,9367829,10.1006/bbrc.1997.7511,"Multiple mutations in a locus encoding a voltage-gated sodium channel have been predicted for pyrethroid resistance in insects.

Sequence analysis of additional resistance haplotypes 5' to this mutation in the hscp locus has uncovered a G to A transition leading to a Val to Met mutation at amino acid position 421 in IS6 (V421M, numbering from Drosophila para).

Cyromazine toxicity to Drosophila melanogaster (Diptera: Drosophilidae) and lack of cross-resistance in natural population strains,9374594,10.1093/jee/90.5.1163,"Cyromazine is an insect growth regulator (IGR) insecticide that is effective against Drosophila melanogaster (Meigen). Both larvae and pupae of a standard laboratory strain were killed over an extremely narrow range of 0.3-0.5 ppm incorporated into the diet. Higher toxic doses killed larvae more rapidly, and lower toxic doses allowed pupariation but usually blocked pupal development. These puparia were abnormally elongated, indicating a failure of the contraction process that produces the characteristic pupal shape. When fed to adults, cyromazine had no effect on adult survival, fecundity, or fertility, even at a 10-fold larval LC50 level. In previous work, D. melanogaster strains recently derived from natural populations were found to be 25- to 100-fold resistant to at least 2 other classes of insecticides, chitin-synthesis inhibitors and carbamates. Here I tested 9 additional strains that were recently selected from widely separated geographical locations in the United States and found them to have resistance to lufenuron and propoxur, but virtually no resistance to cyromazine relative to one another or to 3 long-established laboratory strains. The results show that cross-resistance between the IGRs lufenuron and cyromazine is not present in D. melanogaster. They further suggest that cyromazine control failure in pest insect populations caused by cross-resistance may be minimal.",1997,T G Wilson

Beginning with the last 6 residues of their signal sequences, Styelin C and Cecropin 1 from Drosophila virilis had 8/11 identical amino acids (72.7%). Moreover, 4 of the last 6 residues of their mature peptide domains were also identical. Styelins were shorter, by 8 residues, than dipteran cecropins and preprostyelins contained a conserved, polyanionic C-terminal extension that was absent in preprocecropins.

Using SC35 as a bait, we isolated a human cDNA bearing high homology to the Drosophila transformer-2 (TRA-2) protein. This cDNA was named htra2-beta1. htra2-beta1 is a nuclear protein that colocalizes with SC35 in a speckled pattern. It interacts with several SR proteins tested in yeast. A second form named htra2-beta2 is generated by alternative splicing. This isoform gives rise to a truncated protein without an SR domain. Both isoforms are evenly distributed throughout adult rat tissue. The ratio of these two isoforms changes after stimulation of primary human T-cell and primary rat spleen cell cultures, indicating that alternative splicing is involved in regulation of htra2-beta activity.",1997,"S Stamm, B Beil, G Screaton"
A minK-HERG complex regulates the cardiac potassium current I(Kr),9230439,10.1038/40882,"MinK is a widely expressed protein of relative molecular mass approximately 15K that forms potassium channels by aggregation with other membrane proteins. MinK governs ion channel activation, regulation by second messengers, and the function and structure of the ion conduction pathway. Association of minK with a channel protein known as KvLQT1 produces a voltage-gated outward K+ current (I[sK]) resembling the slow cardiac repolarization current (I[Ks]). HERG, a human homologue of the ether-a-go-go gene of the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster, encodes a protein that produces the rapidly activating cardiac delayed rectifier (I[Kr]). These two potassium currents, I(Ks) and I(Kr), provide the principal repolarizing currents in cardiac myocytes for the termination of action potentials. Although heterologously expressed HERG channels are largely indistinguishable from native cardiac I(Kr), a role for minK in this current is suggested by the diminished I(Kr) in an atrial tumour line subjected to minK antisense suppression. Here we show that HERG and minK form a stable complex, and that this heteromultimerization regulates I(Kr) activity. MinK, through the formation of heteromeric channel complexes, is thus central to the control of the heart rate and rhythm.",1997,"Z Yu, K W Wang, G I Fishman, T V McDonald, E Palma, M B Meyers, S A Goldstein, Z Ming"
Identification of a chick homologue of Fringe and C-Fringe 1: involvement in the neurogenesis and the somitogenesis,9175788,10.1006/bbrc.1997.6652,"In Drosophila, Serrate plays an important role to the wing margin formation.

Serrate-mediated activation of Notch is specifically blocked by the product of the gene fringe in the dorsal compartment of the Drosophila wing imaginal disc,9247339,,"In the developing imaginal wing disc of Drosophila, cells at the dorsoventral boundary require localized Notch activity for specification of the wing margin. The Notch ligands Serrate and Delta are required on opposite sides of the presumptive wing margin and, even though activated forms of Notch generate responses on both sides of the dorsoventral boundary, each ligand generates a compartment-specific response. In this report we demonstrate that Serrate, which is expressed in the dorsal compartment, does not signal in the dorsal regions due to the action of the fringe gene product. Using ectopic expression, we show that regulation of Serrate by fringe occurs at the level of protein and not Serrate transcription. Furthermore, replacement of the N-terminal region of Serrate with the corresponding region of Delta abolishes the ability of fringe to regulate Serrate without altering Serrate-specific signaling.",1997,"Y Gu, R J Fleming, N A Hukriede"
Only a subset of the binary cell fate decisions mediated by Numb/Notch signaling in Drosophila sensory organ lineage requires Suppressor of Hairless,9409662,,"In Drosophila, an adult external sensory organ (bristle) consists of four distinct cells which arise from a sensory organ precursor cell via two rounds of asymmetric divisions. The sensory organ precursor cell first divides to generate two secondary precursor cells, IIa and IIb. The IIa cell then divides to produce the hair cell and the socket cell. Shortly after, the IIb cell divides to generate the neuron and the sheath cell. The membrane-associated protein Numb has been shown to be required for the first two asymmetric divisions. We now report that a new hypomorphic numb mutant not only displays a double-socket phenotype, due to a hair cell to socket cell transformation, but also a double-sheath phenotype, due to a neuron to sheath cell transformation. This provides direct evidence that numb functions in the neuron/sheath cell lineage as well. Those results, together with our observation from immunofluorescence analysis that Numb forms a crescent in the dividing IIa and IIb cells suggest that asymmetric localization of Numb is important for the cell fate determination in all three asymmetric cell divisions in the sensory organ lineage. Interestingly, we found that in the hair/socket cell lineage but not the neuron/sheath cell lineage, a Suppressor of Hairless mutation acts as a dominant suppressor of numb mutations whereas Hairless mutations act as enhancers of numb. Moreover, epistasis analysis indicates that Suppressor of Hairless acts downstream of numb, and results from in vitro binding analysis suggest that the genetic interaction between numb and Hairless may occur through direct protein-protein interaction. These studies reveal that Suppressor of Hairless is required for only a subset of the asymmetric divisions that depend on the function of numb and Notch.",1997,"S Younger-Shepherd, L Y Jan, S Wang, Y N Jan"
Transformation of external sensilla to chordotonal sensilla in the cut mutant of Drosophila assessed by single-cell marking in the embryo and larva,9438250,10.1002/(SICI)1097-0029(19971215)39:6<492::AID-JEMT4>3.0.CO;2-G,"The cut gene of Drosophila melanogaster is an identity selector gene that establishes the program of development and differentiation of external sense organs. Mutations in the cut gene cause a transformation of the external sense organs into chordotonal organs, originally assessed by the use of immunostaining methods [Bodmer et al. (1987): Cell, 51:293-307]. Because of evidence that axonal projections of the transformed neurons within the central nervous system are not completely switched in cut mutants, the transformation of the four cells making up a sense organ was reassessed using single-cell staining with fluorescent dye and differential interface contrast (DIC) microscopy of the embryo and larva. The results provide strong evidence that all cells of the sense organs are completely transformed, exhibiting the morphologies and organelles characteristic of chordotonal sense organs. A comparison of the structures of external sense organs and chordotonal organs indicates that a number of the differences could be due to the degree of development of common structures, and that cut or downstream genes modulate effector genes that are normally utilized in both receptor types. The possible derivation of insect chordotonal and external sense organs from a receptor type found in crustaceans is discussed in the light of arthropod phylogenetics and the molecular genetics of sense organ development.",1997,D J Merritt
Control of compartmental affinity boundaries by hedgehog,9335503,10.1038/39343,"In Drosophila, each segmental primordium is subdivided into two cell populations, the anterior (A) and posterior (P) compartments by the selective activity of the transcription factor Engrailed (En) in P cells. Under En control, P cells secrete, but cannot respond to, the signalling protein Hedgehog (Hh). In contrast, and by default, A cells are programmed to respond to Hh by expressing other signalling molecules, such as Decapentaplegic (Dpp) and Wingless (Wg), which organize growth and patterning in both compartments. Cells of the A and P compartments do not intermix, apparently as a consequence of their having distinct cell affinities that cause them to maximize contact with cells of the same compartment, while minimizing contact with cells from the other compartment. This failure to mix has previously been ascribed to an autonomous and direct role for En in specifying a P, as opposed to an A, cell affinity. However, an alternative hypothesis is that Hh secreted by P cells induces A cells to acquire a distinct cell affinity, ensuring that a stable 'affinity boundary' forms wherever P and A cells meet. Here we show that the affinity boundary that segregates A and P cells into adjacent but immiscible cell populations is to a large extent a consequence of local Hh signalling, rather than a reflection of an intrinsic affinity difference between A and P cells.",1997,"K Basler, I Rodriguez"

Allocation of the thoracic imaginal primordia in the Drosophila embryo,8330530,,"The primordia of the thoracic imaginal discs of the Drosophila embryo originate as groups of cells spanning the parasegment boundary. We present evidence that the thoracic imaginal primordia are allocated in response to signals from the wingless (wg) and decapentaplegic (dpp) gene products. Rows of cells that express wg intersect rows of cells that express dpp to form a ladder-like pattern in the ectoderm of the germ band extended embryo. The imaginal primordia originate as groups of cells which lie near these intersection points. We have used a molecular probe derived from the Distal-less (Dll) gene to show that this population contains progenitor cells for both the dorsal (i.e. wing) and ventral (i.e. leg) discs. Although we show that Dll function is not required for allocation of imaginal cells, activation of an early Dll enhancer may serve as a molecular marker for allocation. A group of cells, which includes the imaginal progenitors, activate this enhancer in response to intercellular signals from wg and perhaps from dpp. We have used a conditional allele of wg to show that wg function is transiently required for both allocation of the imaginal primordia and for initiation of Dll expression in these cells during the brief interval when wg and dpp form the ladder-like pattern. Allocation of the imaginal primordium and activation of Dll expression appear to be parallel responses to a single set of positional cues.",1993,"B Cohen, S M Cohen, A A Simcox"

The Drosophila Ras2 and Rop gene pair: a dual homology with a yeast Ras-like gene and a suppressor of its loss-of-function phenotype,8404533,,"The promoter of the Drosophila melanogaster Ras2 gene is bidirectional, regulating an additional gene oriented in the opposite polarity. The two divergently transcribed genes are only 93 bases apart and deletion analysis proved that common cis-acting elements within this promoter region are required for the transcriptional activity of both genes. We cloned the gene paired with Ras2 in the bidirectional promoter and isolated cDNAs corresponding to its mRNA. The Ras opposite (Rop) gene encodes for a 68 x 10(3) M(r) protein which shares sequence homology with the members of a novel Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene family, including the SLY1, SEC1 and VPS33 (SLP1) genes, all of which are involved in vesicle trafficking among yeast cellular compartments. A highly conserved motif in this family is also found in beta-COP, a coat protein isolated from rat Golgi-bound nonclathrin vesicles. Thus, the Rop protein may be a component of one of the vesicle trafficking pathways in Drosophila cells. The Rop gene expression during embryogenesis is restricted to the central nervous system (CNS) and the garland cells, a small group of nephrocytes that takes up waste materials from the haemolymph by endocytosis. Ras2 is also expressed in the embryonic garland cells. In postembryonic stages, the two genes are co-expressed in the larval salivary glands and the central nervous system, and in the adult CNS and reproductive systems. Interestingly, the S. cerevisiae SLY1-20 allele is a suppressor of the loss of the YPT1 gene, a ras-like gene implicated in vesicle translocation, suggesting that the two genes may interact with one another. Since Sec1p and beta-COP may also interact with small GTP-binding proteins of the ras superfamily, it is conceivable that the Rop and Ras2 gene products are not just co-expressed in common tissues, but may also functionally interact with one another in these tissues.",1993,"Z Kimchie, Z Lev, N Halachmi, A Salzberg, N Cohen"
Hybrid lethal systems in the Drosophila melanogaster species complex,8224857,10.1007/BF02424474,"Lethal phases of the hybrids between Drosophila melanogaster and its sibling species, D. simulans are classified into three types: (1) embryonic lethality in hybrids carrying D. simulans cytoplasm and D. melanogaster X chromosome, (2) larval lethality in hybrids not carrying D. simulans X, and (3) temperature-sensitive pupal lethality in hybrids carrying D. simulans X. The same lethal phases are also observed when either of the two other sibling species, D. mauritiana or D. sechellia, is employed for hybridization with D. melanogaster. Here, we describe genetic analyses of each hybrid lethality, and demonstrate that these three types of lethality are independent phenomena. We then propose two models to interpret the mechanisms of each hybrid lethality. The first model is a modification of the conventional X/autosome imbalance hypothesis assuming a lethal gene and a suppressor gene are involved in the larval lethality, while the second model is for embryonic lethality assuming an interaction between a maternal-effect lethal gene and a suppressor gene.",1993,"M T Yamamoto, K Sawamura, T K Watanabe"
Inositol trisphosphate receptor and Ca2+ signalling,8103938,10.1098/rstb.1993.0077,"Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) is a second messenger that releases Ca2+ from the intracellular stores. The InsP3 receptor (InsP3-R) was purified and its cDNA was cloned. We have found that InsP3-R is identical to the P400 protein identified as a protein enriched in the cerebellar Purkinje cells. We generated an L fibroblast cell transfectant that produced cDNA derived InsP3-R. The expressed protein displays high affinity and specificity for InsP3. InsP3 induces Ca2+ release from the membrane vesicles of the transfected cells. Incorporation of purified InsP3-R into a lipid bilayer showed InsP3 induced Ca2+ release. These result suggest that InsP3-R is a Ca2+ release channel. Immunogold method using monoclonal antibodies against the receptor showed that it is highly condensed on the smooth surfaced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and slightly on the outer nuclear membrane and rough ER. Cross linking experiments show that the InsP3-R forms a homotetramer. The approximately 650 N-terminal amino acids are highly conserved between mouse and Drosophila melanogaster, and this region has the critical sequences for InsP3 binding. We found novel subtypes of the InsP3-R resulting from RNA-splicing that are expressed in a tissue-specific and developmentally specific manner and also resulting from different genes. It is believed that there are two Ca2+ release mechanisms, InsP3-induced Ca2+ release (IICR) and Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release (CICR).

A chicken homeobox gene related to Drosophila paired is predominantly expressed in the developing limb,8101172,10.1006/dbio.1993.1184,"We identified a homeobox-containing gene, Prx-1, isolated from the chick limb bud cDNA library. The homeodomain sequence is related to Drosophila paired and goose-berry and mouse Pax-3, Pax-6, and Pax-7. The deduced amino acid sequence of the Prx-1 gene product reveals the absence of a paired-box sequence and extensive similarity to mouse S8 and MHox homeodomain proteins, thus constituting a new class of homeobox gene. Using an in situ hybridization method, the Prx-1 gene is shown to be expressed predominantly in the limb bud and visceral arches. At early stages of limb development, distal mesodermal cells express the homeobox gene with an apparent gradient along the proximal-distal axis. The signal is absent in the apical and nonridge ectoderm. Removal of the apical ectodermal ridge had no apparent effect on the subsequent expression of Prx-1 in the limb mesenchyme. The Prx-1-expressing cells are later confined to the interdigital and perichondrial regions. The Prx-1 transcripts are also detectable in the mesenchyme of the visceral arches and facial primordia subjacent to the ectoderm. The Prx-1 gene is weakly expressed in somites and condensing vertebrae. No signal is detectable in neural tube and ectodermal epithelium. These results suggest that the Prx-1 homeodomain protein is involved in the differentiation of bone, muscle, and other tissues of mesodermal origin during limb development.",1993,"E Koyama, H Ohuchi, S Taniguchi, F Myokai, T Nohno, S Noji, T Saito"
P element transposition in Drosophila melanogaster: an analysis of sister-chromatid pairs and the formation of intragenic secondary insertions during meiosis,8384146,,"The gap-repair model proposes that P elements move via a conservative, ""cut-and-paste"" mechanism followed by double-strand gap repair, using either the sister chromatid or homolog as the repair template. We have tested this model by examining meiotic perturbations of an X-linked ry+ transposon during the meiotic cycle of males, employing the mei-S332 mutation, which induces high frequency equational nondisjunction. This system permits the capture of both sister-X chromatids in a single patroclinous daughter. In the presence of P-transposase, transpositions within the immediate proximity of the original site are quite frequent. These are readily detectable among the patroclinous daughters, thereby allowing the combined analysis of the transposed element, the donor site and the putative sister-strand template. Molecular analysis of 22 meiotic transposition events provide results that support the gap-repair model of P element transposition. Prior to this investigation, it was not known whether transposition events were exclusively or predominantly premeiotic. The results of our genetic analysis revealed that P elements mobilize at relatively high frequencies during meiosis. We estimated that approximately 4% of the dysgenic male gametes have transposon perturbations of meiotic origin; the proportion of gametes containing lesions of premeiotic origin was estimated at 32%.",1993,"A Chovnick, S B Daniels"

In Drosophila, bundles of Kenyon cells of the mushroom bodies were stained. In worker bees and drones, the relay neurons of the median and lateral antennoglomerular tracts were labelled.

Conservation and change in structural and 5' flanking sequences of esterase 6 in sibling Drosophila species,8375665,10.1007/BF02424448,"Esterase 6 (Est-6/EST6) is the major beta-carboxylesterase in D. melanogaster and its siblings D. simulans and D. mauritiana. It is expressed in several tissues but its major site of expression is the sperm ejaculatory duct of the adult male. Although EST6 activity affects reproductive fitness, there are high levels of electrophoretic and activity polymorphism, at least within D. melanogaster and D. simulans. Here we present the nucleotide sequences of an Est-6 allele and its flanking regions from each of D. simulans and D. mauritiana and compare them with the published D. melanogaster sequences. As might be expected, replacement sites are significantly less divergent than exon silent sites in all comparisons, suggesting that selection is acting to maintain EST6 structure and function among the three species. Nevertheless, the ratio of the levels of replacement to silent site divergence is still much higher for Est-6 than for seven of ten other genes (including both isozyme-coding loci) for which comparable data have been published for these species. This is consistent with the high levels of EST6 electrophoretic polymorphism within D. melanogaster and D. simulans and implies that selective constraints against amino acid change are relatively weak for EST6. By contrast, comparisons involving promotor sequences show that the level of divergence in the first 350bp 5' of the gene is significantly lower than those for four of the six other loci for which comparable data have been published for these species. In particular, there are two perfectly conserved stretches (-1 to -158bp and -219 to -334bp) each over 100bp long included in this 350bp region. Thus the data suggest a relatively low level of selective constraint on the amino acid sequence of EST6 but a relatively high level of constraint on sequences affecting aspects of its expression.",1993,"J G Oakeshott, J Karotam, A C Delves"
Similar tissue-specific expression of the Adh genes from different Drosophila species is mediated by distinct arrangements of cis-acting sequences,7688066,10.1007/BF00276884,"In Drosophila melanogaster transformants, the alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) genes from D. affinidisjuncta and D. grimshawi show similar levels of expression except in the adult midgut where the D. affinidisjuncta gene is expressed about 10- to 20-fold more strongly. To study the arrangement of cis-acting sequences responsible for this regulatory difference, homologous restriction sites were used to create a series of chimeric genes that switched fragments from the 5' and 3' flanking regions of these two genes. Chimeric genes were introduced into the germ-line of D. melanogaster, and Adh gene expression was analyzed by measuring RNA levels. Various gene fragments in the promoter region and elsewhere influence expression in the adult midgut and in whole larvae and adults. Comparison of these results with earlier studies involving chimeras between the D. affinidisjuncta and D. hawaiiensis genes indicates that expression in the adult midgut is influenced by multiple regulatory sequences and that distinct arrangements of regulatory sequences can result in similar levels of expression both in the adult midgut and in the whole organism.",1993,"C Y Wu, M D Brennan"
Activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on cultured Drosophila and other insect neurones,7504110,10.1113/jphysiol.1993.sp019613,"1. Using whole-cell and single channel recordings, we have examined the properties of acetylcholine (ACh)-activated currents in neurones from larval and pupal Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly), larval and embryonic Musca domestica (house fly), and nymphal Schistocerca gregaria (locust). 2. In all preparations, single channel recordings revealed two major classes of ACh-activated channels, with average conductances of approximately 32 and 59 pS. 3. At ACh concentrations from 1 to 10 microM, channel activity in Drosophila larval neurones occurs in bursts with an average of 1-2 openings. Open times and burst durations are described by one or two exponentials. Burst durations for the 32 pS channel (approximately 3 ms, slow component) were longer than those for the 59 pS channel (approximately 1.0 ms). The mean open interval duration for the 32 pS channel (slow component) was also longer than that of the 59 pS channel. 4. At high ACh (20-200 microM) concentrations, bursts of the smaller conductance channel occur in clusters separated by long-lived periods without channel activity. Considerable kinetic heterogeneity was observed among clusters. 5. The whole-cell dose-response curve suggests that activation of current by ACh increases up to at least 100 microM and that multiple ligand binding steps are involved. 6. Drosophila and Musca larval neuronal ACh-activated channels show some unique features in their cholinergic pharmacological properties: (a) they are only weakly activated by the potent neuromuscular nicotinic agonist suberyldicholine, (b) hexamethonium and decamethonium are weak, but approximately equi-effective blockers, and (c) alpha- and kappa-bungarotoxin (BTX) both blocked reversibly, though alpha-BTX appears to be the more potent inhibitor.",1993,"C J Lingle, J L Albert"
The protein Sex-lethal antagonizes the splicing factor U2AF to regulate alternative splicing of transformer pre-mRNA,7680770,10.1038/362171a0,"Somatic sexual differentiation in Drosophila melanogaster involves a cascade of regulated splicing events and provides an attractive model system for the analysis of alternative splicing mechanisms. The protein Sex-lethal (Sxl) activates a female-specific 3' splice site in the first intron of transformer (tra) pre-mRNA while repressing an alternative non-sex-specific site. We have developed an in vitro system that recapitulates this regulation in a manner consistent with genetic, transfection and fly transformation studies. Using this system, we have determined the molecular basis of the splice site switch. Here we show that Sxl inhibits splicing to the non-sex-specific (default) site by specifically binding to its polypyrimidine tract, blocking the binding of the essential splicing factor U2AF. This enables U2AF to activate the lower-affinity female-specific site. A splicing 'effector' domain present in U2AF but absent from Sxl accounts for the different activities of these two polypyrimidine-tract-binding proteins: addition of the U2AF effector domain to Sxl converts it from a splicing repressor to an activator and renders it unable to mediate splice-site switching.",1993,"J Valcárcel, R Singh, M R Green, P D Zamore"
NTP Toxicology and Carcinogenesis Studies of p-Nitroaniline (CAS No. 100-01-6) in B6C3F1 Mice (Gavage Studies),12616293,,"p-Nitroaniline is an intermediate in the preparation of several azo dyes used for coloring consumer products. Toxicology and carcinogenicity studies were conducted by administering p-nitroaniline (>99% pure) in corn oil by gavage to groups of male and female B6C3F1 mice for 14 days, 13 weeks, and 2 years. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium, Chinese hamster ovary cells, mouse Iymphoma cells, and Drosophila melanogaster. 14-DAY STUDIES: Groups of five male and five female B6C3F1 mice received p-nitroaniline in corn oil by gavage at doses of 0, 10, 30, 100, 300, or 1,000 mg/kg body weight 5 days per week for 2 weeks. All mice that received 1,000 mg/kg died from chemical-related toxicity by day 4 of the studies. Final mean body weights of mice receiving 300 mg/kg or less were similar to those of the controls. Hematology results were consistent with chemical-related methemoglobinemia and regenerative anemia. Met hemoglobin concentrations in all groups of dosed mice were significantly higher than those in controls. Hematocrit values in mice that received 300 mg/kg and total erythrocyte counts in mice that received 100 or 300 mg/kg were significantly lower than those in controls. Reticulocyte counts in 300 mg/kg male mice and in 100 or 300 mg/kg females were significantly higher than controls. Heinz bodies were observed in erythrocytes of all 300 mg/kg mice and in two 100 mg/kg male mice. The absolute and relative spleen weights of 100 and 300 mg/kg mice were significantly greater than those of the controls. Hematopoiesis and pigment (hemosiderin) accumulation were observed in the splenic red pulp of males and females receiving 300 mg/kg; pigment (hemosiderin) accumulation in Kupffer cells of the liver was also seen in male mice at this dose level. 13-WEEK STUDIES: Groups of 20 male and 20 female B6C3F1 mice received p-nitroaniline in corn oil by gavage at doses of 0, 1, 3, 10, 30, or 100 mg/kg body weight 5 days per week for up to 13 weeks. Eight or nine mice in each group were evaluated at 7 weeks. There were no deaths associated with exposure to p-nitroaniline, and final mean body weights of dosed mice were similar to those of the controls. Hematologic and pathologic findings at 7 and 13 weeks were similar to those seen in the 14-day studies and occurred primarily in the 30 and 100 mg/kg groups. Met hemoglobin concentrations were increased and hematocrit levels and erythrocyte counts were decreased relative to those of the controls. Heinz bodies were observed in erythrocytes and nucleated erythrocytes and reticulocytes were increased in number. Absolute and relative spleen weights of male and female mice receiving 30 and 100 mg/kg were significantly greater than those of controls at 7 and 13 weeks. Absolute and relative liver weights of female mice necropsied at 7 weeks were significantly greater in the 30 and 100 mg/kg groups; by 13 weeks, both absolute and relative liver weights were similar to control values. The incidence or severity of splenic hematopoiesis and pigmentation (hemosiderin) increased with dose at the 7-week interim evaluations and at the end of the studies. Pigment (hemosiderin) was also present in Kupffer cells of the liver in dosed male mice. 2-YEAR STUDIES: Groups of 70 male and 70 female B6C3F1 mice received p-nitroaniline in corn oil by gavage at doses of 0, 3, 30, or 100 mg/kg body weight for 5 days per week for up to 103 weeks. The dose selection was based on the hematologic and pathologic findings of the 13-week studies. Nine or ten mice from each group were evaluated at 9 and 15 months for the presence of chemical-related lesions. Body Weights, Clinical Findings, Survival, and Hematology: Mean body weights of male and female mice that received p-nitroaniline were similar to those of control mice throughout the 2-year studies. There were no clinical findings associated with chemical exposure, and survival of dosed mice was similar to that of controls. The hematology findings at the 9 and 15-month interim evaluations were similar to those in the 14-day and 13-week s 13-week studies. The methemoglobin concentrations were significantly higher in all 30 or 100 mg/kg mice; sulfhemoglobin concentrations were significantly higher at 9 months in all 30 or 100 mg/kg female mice and at 15 months in 100 mg/kg females. Hematocrit and erythrocyte counts in 100 mg/kg mice were significantly lower than those in controls. By 9 months, reticulocyte counts were significantly higher in all 30 or 100 mg/kg mice. At 15 months, only the 100 mg/kg mice exhibited significantly higher reticulocyte counts. Neoplasms and Nonneoplastic Lesions: Lesions related to the administration of p-nitroaniline occurred in the spleen, liver, and bone marrow, primarily in mice receiving 30 or 100 mg/kg; these were observed at the 9- and 15-month interim evaluations and at the end of the studies. There were increases in the incidence or severity of splenic congestion, hematopoiesis, pigment (hemosiderin) accumulation, Kupffer cell pigmentation in the liver, and bone marrow hypercellularity (hyperplasia). The incidences of hemangiosarcoma of the liver (0 ppm, 0/50; 3 ppm, 1/50; 30 ppm, 2/50; 100 ppm, 4/50) and hemangioma or hemangiosarcoma (combined) at all sites (5/50, 3/50, 4/50, 10/50) were marginally increased in 100 mg/kg male mice. The incidence of hepatocellular adenoma or carcinoma (combined) was significantly decreased (25/50, 26/50, 25/50, 13/50) in 100 mg/kg male mice. GENETIC TOXICOLOGY: p-Nitroaniline is mutagenic in vitro. It was tested in two laboratories for induction of gene mutations in several strains of Salmonella typhimurium. Both studies showed positive results in strain TA98, with and without S9 activation; results were negative for all other strains. p-Nitroaniline was tested in two laboratories for induction of sister cremated exchanges and chromosomal aberrations in Chinese hamster ovary cells. In the sister cremated exchange study, one laboratory reported negative results without S9 and positive results with S9; the second laboratory reported equivocal results without S9 and negative results with S9. In the chromosomal aberrations study, both laboratories found positive results with S9. Without S9, one laboratory reported weakly positive results while the other reported negative results. p-Nitroaniline induced trifluorothymidine resistance in L5178Y mouse Iymphoma cells in the absence of S9; no induction of trifluorothymidine resistance was noted with S9. In contrast to the positive results in the previous tests, p-nitroaniline did not induce sex-linked recessive lethal mutations in germ cells of male Drosophila melanogaster when administered by feeding or injection to adult males or by feeding to larvae. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of these 2-year gavage studies there was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of p-nitroaniline in male B6C3F1 mice based on the increased incidences of hemangiosarcoma of the liver and hemangioma or hemangiosarcoma (combined) at all sites. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of p-nitroaniline in female B6C3F1 mice receiving doses of 3, 30, or 100 mg/kg.",1993,National Toxicology Program
The Polycomb group gene Posterior Sex Combs encodes a chromosomal protein,7687213,,"The Posterior Sex Combs (Psc) gene of Drosophila has been studied at the molecular level both because it is a Polycomb group (Pc-G) gene and hence required for the maintenance of segmental determination, and because it is the Drosophila homolog of the murine bmi-1 oncogene. Although genetic interactions indicated that Psc functioned as a Pc-G gene, the zygotic mutant phenotype of Psc showed little evidence of segmental transformations. We have examined mutant embryos derived from a mutant maternal germ line and found a stronger mutant phenotype, indicating that the weak zygotic phenotype of Psc is due to maternal rescue. We have found that Psc RNA accumulates in developing oocytes and this maternal RNA is presumably responsible for the maternal rescue. We have studied the expression of the Psc gene at both the RNA and protein levels. On northern blots, we find evidence for two Psc mRNAs and, on western blots, we find evidence for two Psc proteins that are altered either in abundance or size in Psc mutants. The Psc protein accumulates in all regions of the embryo and also in many tissues in a variety of developmental stages. In all cases, it is nuclear, as is its mammalian homolog, the bmi-1 protein. On polytene chromosomes, we find Psc at 45 chromosomal loci where two other Pc-G proteins are present.",1993,"P N Adler, E C Martin"
Binding of the Ras activator son of sevenless to insulin receptor substrate-1 signaling complexes,8391166,10.1126/science.8391166,"Signal transmission by insulin involves tyrosine phosphorylation of a major insulin receptor substrate (IRS-1) and exchange of Ras-bound guanosine diphosphate for guanosine triphosphate. Proteins containing Src homology 2 and 3 (SH2 and SH3) domains, such as the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase and growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2), bind tyrosine phosphate sites on IRS-1 through their SH2 regions. Such complexes in COS cells were found to contain the heterologously expressed putative guanine nucleotide exchange factor encoded by the Drosophila son of sevenless gene (dSos). Thus, GRB2, p85, or other proteins with SH2-SH3 adapter sequences may link Sos proteins to IRS-1 signaling complexes as part of the mechanism by which insulin activates Ras.",1993,"U Banerjee, A D Cherniack, J K Klarlund, M P Czech, L M Kozma, K Baltensperger, A Chawla"
Crumbs and stardust act in a genetic pathway that controls the organization of epithelia in Drosophila melanogaster,8365569,10.1006/dbio.1993.1243,"We provide evidence that the genes crumbs (crb) and stardust (sdt) encode critical components of a pathway that acts at the apical pole of epithelial cells to control the cytoarchitecture of ectodermally derived epithelia of the Drosophila embryo. We describe the developmental defects caused by sdt mutations, which are very similar to those associated with mutations in crb. In both mutants the epithelial structure of ectodermal cells breaks down during early organogenesis, leading to the formation of irregular clusters of cells and cell death in some epithelia. Certain cells can, however, compensate for the loss of crb or sdt function in a tissue-specific manner, later reassuming an epithelial cell shape and forming small epithelial vesicles, suggesting that, besides crb and sdt, other tissue-specific components are involved in this process. The crb protein (CRB) is continuously expressed in wild-type embryos in cells of the ectoderm and ectodermally derived epithelia. In sdt mutant embryos CRB is present only during gastrulation, but becomes undetectable during germ band extension; the protein is again visible during early organogenesis, at the time when the sdt mutant phenotype becomes apparent. In sdt mutant embryos, CRB is associated with the apical membrane only in well-differentiated epithelial cells, but it is expressed diffusely in the cytoplasm of cells which have lost epithelial morphology. Our results suggest that time- and tissue-specific control mechanisms exist to establish and maintain epithelial cell structure. Mosaic experiments suggest that sdt is required cell autonomously, in contrast to crb, the requirement of which appears to be non-cell-autonomous. Double mutant combinations of crb and sdt suggest that these genes are part of a common genetic pathway (crb/sdt pathway), in which sdt acts downstream of crb and is activated by the latter.",1993,"E Knust, U Tepass"
Conservation of alternative splicing and genomic organization of the myosin alkali light-chain (Mlc1) gene among Drosophila species,8355600,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a040043,"The Mlc1 gene of Drosophila melanogaster encodes two MLC1 isoforms via developmentally regulated alternative pre-mRNA splicing. In larval muscle and tubular and abdominal muscles of adults, all of the six exons are included in the spliced mRNA, whereas, in the fibrillar indirect flight muscle of adult, exon 5 is excluded from the mRNA. We show that this tissue-specific pattern of alternative splicing of the Mlc1 pre-mRNA is conserved in D. simulans, D. pseudoobscura, and D. virilis. Isolation and sequencing of the Mlc1 genes from these three other Drosophila species have revealed that the overall organization of the genes is identical and that the genes have maintained a very high level of sequence identity within the coding region. Pairwise amino acid identities are 94%-99%, and there are no charge changes among the proteins. Total nucleotide divergence within the coding region of the four genes supports the accepted genealogy of these species, but the data indicate a significantly higher rate of amino acid replacement in the branch leading to D. pseudoobscura. A comparison of nucleotide substitutions in the coding portions of exon 5 and exon 6, which encode the alternative carboxyl termini of the two MLC1 isoforms, suggests that exon 5 is subject to greater evolutionary constraints than is exon 6. In addition to the coding sequences, there is significant sequence conservation within the 5' and 3' noncoding DNA and two of the introns, including one that flanks exon 5. These regions are candidates for cis-regulatory elements. Our results suggest that evolutionary constraints are acting on both the coding and noncoding sequences of the Mlc1 gene to maintain proper expression and function of the two MLC1 polypeptides.",1993,"A G Clark, B G Leicht, E M Lyckegaard, C M Benedict"
In vivo observation of the puff-specific protein no-on transient A (NONA) in nuclei of Drosophila embryos,8270623,,"The spatial distribution of no-on transient A (NONA), a protein associated with specific puffs on polytene chromosomes, was followed in nuclei of living Drosophila embryos by microinjection of fluorescently labeled monoclonal antibody to NONA. The injected antibodies remained active until the larval stage, revealing the distribution of the NONA protein throughout embryogenesis. Most injected animals completed embryonic development and hatched as normal larvae. NONA was restricted to the cytoplasm until the end of cycle 11. We document an active uptake of the NONA-antibody complex into early interphase nuclei from nuclear cycle 14 onwards, following each mitosis. Significant differences in the distribution of the protein between fixed and living embryos were apparent, particularly at high resolution. The NONA protein was localized in the nuclei of living embryos at discrete sites, most of which lay at the periphery and some of which were tightly clustered. The constellation of sites changed with time; in some nuclei these changes were fast whereas in other nuclei the pattern was quite stable. These data suggest that specific protein complexes associated with active interphase chromatin, and possibly chromatin in general, are mobile in the living organism.",1993,"D J Arndt-Jovin, H Saumweber, P Buchenau"
Mutations in the segment polarity genes wingless and porcupine impair secretion of the wingless protein,8262072,,"We have characterized the molecular nature of mutations in wingless (wg), a segment polarity gene acting during various stages of Drosophila development. Embryo-lethal alleles have undergone mutations in the protein-encoding domain of the gene, including deletions and point mutations of conserved residues. In a temperature sensitive mutation, a conserved cysteine residue is replaced by a serine. In embryo-viable alleles, the wg transcriptional unit is not affected. Immunostaining of mutant embryos shows that the embryo-lethal alleles produce either no wg antigen or a form of the protein that is retained within cells. Interestingly, embryos mutant for the segment polarity gene porcupine show a similar retention of the wg antigen. We have also transfected wild type wg alleles into Drosophila tissue culture cells, which then display wg protein on the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix. In similar experiments with mutant alleles, the proteins are retained in intracellular compartments and appear not to be secreted. These data provide further evidence that wg acts as a secreted factor and suggest that porcupine provides an accessory function for wg protein secretion or transport.",1993,"C Harryman-Samos, R Nusse, J Klingensmith, N Perrimon, M van den Heuvel"
NTP Toxicology and Carcinogenesis Studies of Coumarin (CAS No. 91-64-5) in F344/N Rats and B6C3F1 Mice (Gavage Studies),12616289,,"Coumarin is the basic structure of numerous naturally occurring compounds with important and diverse physiological activities. More than a thousand coumarin derivatives have been described, varying from simple coumarins containing alkyl and hydroxyl side chains to complex coumarins with benzoyl, furanoyl, pyranoyl, or alkylphosphorothionyl substituents. Coumarin and 3,4-dihydrocoumarin were nominated by the Food and Drug Administration and the National Cancer Institute for study because of the widespread use of coumarin in perfumes, cosmetics, and other products as a fragrance, continued interest in coumarin compounds as flavor-enhancing agents for foods, and the interest in structure-activity relationships of this important group of compounds. Coumarin is believed to be metabolized to a 3,4-epoxide intermediate, which may be responsible for its toxic effects, while 3,4-dihydrocoumarin, which lacks the 3,4-double bond, is not considered likely to form an epoxide intermediate. Toxicity and carcinogenicity studies were conducted by administering coumarin (97% pure) in corn oil by gavage to groups of male and female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice for 16 days, 13 weeks, and 2 years. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium, cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, Drosophila melanogaster, and B6C3F1 mice. 16-DAY STUDY IN RATS: Groups of five male and five female rats received coumarin in corn oil by gavage at doses of 0, 25, 50, 100, 200, or 400 mg per kg body weight, 5 days a week for a total of 12 doses in a 16-day period. All female rats and four male rats receiving 400 mg/kg died. The mean body weight gains and final mean body weights of surviving dosed male and female rats were similar to those of the controls. There were no clinical signs of organ-specific toxicity, and there was no evidence of impaired blood coagulation from measurements of capillary clotting time or prothrombin and activated partial thromboplastin time. 16-DAY STUDY IN MICE: Groups of five male and five female mice received coumarin in corn oil by gavage at doses of 0, 40, 75, 150, 300, or 600 mg per kg body weight, 5 days a week for a total of 12 doses in a 16-day period. All mice receiving 600 mg/kg, two male mice receiving 300 mg/kg, and one male mouse receiving 75 mg/kg died. The mean body weight gains and final mean body weights of surviving dosed male and female mice were similar to those of the controls. Clinical findings of inactivity, excessive lacrimation, piloerection, bradypnea, ptosis, or ataxia were observed in some mice from the 300 and 600 mg/kg groups within the first several hours after dosing. Capillary clotting time and platelet counts of dosed mice were similar to those of controls. 13-WEEK STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 10 male and 10 female rats received coumarin in corn oil by gavage at doses of 0,19, 38, 75,150, or 300 mg per kg body weight. Three male and three female rats receiving 300 mg/kg died. The mean body weight gains and final mean body weights of male rats that received 150 and 300 mg/kg were significantly lower than those of the controls. There were no clinical signs related to specific organ toxicity. Male and female rats receiving coumarin exhibited dose-related decreases in mean erythrocyte volume and mean erythrocyte hemoglobin, and dose-related increases in erythrocyte counts. Serum levels of total bilirubin and one or more cytoplasmic enzymes including alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, ornithine carbamoyltransferase, and/or sorbitol dehydrogenase in males and females receiving 300 mg/kg were higher than those of controls. The absolute and relative liver weights of male and female rats that received 150 and 300 mg/kg were significantly greater than those of the controls. Centrilobular hepatocellular degeneration and necrosis, chronic active inflammation, and bile duct hyperplasia were observed in the liver of rats receiving 150 or 300 mg/kg. The high dose selected for the 2-year study was 100 mg/kg, which was just below the level at which mortality, lower final mean body weiody weights, and treatment-related liver lesions were observed in the 13-week study. 13-WEEK STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 10 male and 10 female mice received coumarin in corn oil by gavage at doses of 0, 19, 38, 75, 150, or 300 mg per kg body weight. Two male mice receiving 300 mg/kg died. The mean body weight gain and final mean body weight of surviving male mice that received 300 mg/kg were significantly lower than those of the controls. No clinical signs of toxicity were observed. Male and female mice receiving coumarin exhibited dose-related decreases in mean erythrocyte volume and mean erythrocyte hemoglobin. The absolute and relative liver weights of males and females that received 150 and 300 mg/kg were significantly greater than those of the controls. Centrilobular hepatocellular hypertrophy was observed in male and female mice receiving 300 mg/kg. The high dose selected for the 2-year study was 200 mg/kg, which was just below the level at which mortality and liver lesions were observed in the 13-week study. 2-YEAR STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 60 male and 60 female rats were administered coumarin in corn oil by gavage at doses of 0, 25, 50, or 100 mg per kg body weight. After 15 months, 10 animals from each group were evaluated. Survival, Body Weights, and Clinical Findings: None of the male rats receiving 100 mg/kg and only two males receiving 50 mg/kg survived until the end of the study (vehicle control, 28/50; 25 mg/kg, 9/50; 50 mg/kg, 2/51; 100 mg/kg, 0/50). Survival of dosed female rats was similar to that of the controls (29/50, 38/50, 36/50, 30/50). The reduced survival in dosed male rats was primarily attributed to chemical-related exacerbation of spontaneously occurring renal disease. Final mean body weights of female rats that received 100 mg/kg and all dosed groups of male rats were lower than those of the controls. There were no clinical signs of toxicity in rats, other than nonspecific signs relating to debilitation as a result of renal or other spontaneous disease. Hematology and Clinical Chemistry: At the 15-month interim evaluation, the values for one or more hematologic parameters including mean erythrocyte volume, mean erythrocyte hemoglobin in 50 and 100 mg/kg rats, and hematocrit or hemoglobin in 100 mg/kg rats were significantly lower than those of controls. Activated partial thromboplastin times were also significantly lower in 50 and 100 mg/kg males, while platelet counts were significantly higher. Activities of alanine aminotransferase, sorbitol dehydrogenase, or g-glutamyltransferase in 50 and 100 mg/kg male and 100 mg/kg female rats were significantly higher than those of the controls at the 15-month interim evaluation. Pathology Findings: The principal lesions associated with the administration of coumarin to rats for up to 2 years occurred in the liver, kidney, and forestomach. While the hepatic lesions were seen in all groups of males, they occurred only in the 50 and 100 mg/kg females. The lesions consisted of a spectrum of changes including hepatocellular necrosis, fibrosis, cytologic alteration, and increased severity of bile duct hyperplasia. The incidences of hepatocellular neoplasms were not increased in dosed rats. There was a chemical-related increase in the average severity of nephropathy in all groups of dosed male and female rats. There were corresponding increased incidences of parathyroid gland hyperplasia in all groups of dosed males, probably as a result of compromised renal function. In the standard evaluation of single kidney sections, a low incidence of renal adenomas was seen in all groups of males and in 100 mg/kg females (males: vehicle control, 1/49; 25 mg/kg, 2/50; 50 mg/kg, 2/51; 100 mg/kg, 1/50; females: 0/49, 0/50, 0/50, 2/49). An evaluation of step sections identified additional individuals with renal tubule focal hyperplasia (males: 2/49, 12/50, 10/51, 6/50; females: 1/49, 0/50, 4/50, 2/49) and adenoma (males: 0/49, 4/50, 5/51, 4/50; females: 0/49, 0/50, 1/50,1/49) in the dosed groups. The incidences of forestomach ulcers in all groups of dosed male rats and in 100 mg/kg female rats were significantly greater than those of the controls (males: 7/48, 24/50, 35/51, 34/50; females: 1/48, 1/49, 6/50, 9/48). STOP-EXPOSURE EVALUATION: A group of 40 male rats received 100 mg/kg coumarin in corn oil by gavage for 9 months, when 20 of the animals were necropsied and evaluated. The remainder of the male rats received only the corn oil vehicle during the 15-month recovery period. Similarly, a group of 30 male rats received 100 mg/kg coumarin in corn oil by gavage for 15 months, when 10 of the rats were necropsied and evaluated. The remaining 20 rats received only corn oil during the 9-month recovery period. A group of 20 vehicle control male rats were necropsied at 9 months, and another 10 vehicle control male rats were necropsied at 15 months. While chemical-related hepatic lesions were seen at both the 9- and 15-month interim evaluations, the incidences and severities of these lesions following the recovery period were generally similar to controls. Thus, the hepatic lesions produced by 9 or 15 months of exposure were reversible. In contrast to the liver lesions, the severity of nephropathy in male rats following the recovery period was significantly greater than that of males examined at the 9- and 15-month interim evaluations. This is not unexpected, since nephropathy is a progressive degenerative disease that naturally increases in severity with age. The incidence of renal tubule hyperplasia in the 15-month stop-exposure group (dosed for 15 months followed by the recovery period) and the incidence of renal tubule adenoma in the 9-month stop-exposure group were significantly greater than those of the control group. 2-YEAR STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 70 male and 70 female mice were administered coumarin in corn oil by gavage at doses of 0, 50, 100, or 200 mg per kg body weight for up to 2 years. After 15 months, 19 or 20 mice from each group were evaluated. Survival, Body Weights, and Clinical Findings: Survival of dosed male and female mice was similar to that of the controls (males: vehicle control, 43/50; 50 mg/kg, 47/50; 100 mg/kg, 42/50; 200 mg/kg, 37/51; females: 33/50, 40/50, 42/51, 28/51). The mean body weights of 200 mg/kg male and female mice were lower than those of controls throughout much of the study. There were no clinical findings related to chemical administration. Hematology and Clinical Chemistry: Mean erythrocyte volume, mean erythrocyte hemoglobin, and hematocrit of 200 mg/kg males and mean erythrocyte volume of 200 mg/kg females were significantly lower than those of the controls. Blood platelet counts of 200 mg/kg males and females were significantly higher than those of controls. There were no biologically significant differences in enzyme activities between dosed and control mice. Pathology Findings: The principal toxic lesions associated with the administration of coumarin to mice occurred in the liver. The incidences of centrilobular hypertrophy in 100 and 200 mg/kg males and 200 mg/kg females were significantly greater than those of controls. The incidences of syncytial alteration in all male dose groups and in 200 mg/kg females were also significantly greater than controls. The incidences of eosinophilic foci, a putative preneoplastic lesion, and of hepatocellular adenoma were significantly greater in the 50 and 100 mg/kg females. Hepatocellular carcinomas occurred with low incidences in the dosed females, but none occurred in the controls. The overall incidence of hepatocellular neoplasms (benign and malignant combined) in the 50 and 100 mg/kg females (control, 8/50; 50 mg/kg, 27/49; 100 mg/kg, 31/51; 200 mg/kg, 13/50) exceeds the range in historical controls (range 2&percnt;-34&percnt;; 129/898, 14.4&percnt;) from recent NTP studies. The reason for a lack of liver response in 200 mg/kg female mice is not known, but may be due in part to the decrease in body weight. While the incidences of eosinophilic foci were marginally greater in dosed male mice, the incidences of hepatocellular neoplasms were similar among the dosed and control groups. The incidences of alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas were significantly greater in 200 mg/kg male and female mice than in the controls. Further, the incidence of alveolar/bronchiolar carcinoma in 200 mg/kg females was also significantly greater than in controls. The overall incidence of pulmonary neoplasms (benign and malignant combined) in the 200 mg/kg groups (males: 14/50, 9/50,15/50, 25/51; females: 2/51, 5/49, 7/49, 27/51) exceeds the range in historical controls (males: range 6&percnt;-28&percnt;; 166/900, 18.4&percnt;; females: range 0&percnt;-14&percnt;; 58/899, 6.5&percnt;) from recent NTP studies. The incidence of squamous cell papilloma of the forestomach in 50 mg/kg males was greater than that of the controls (2/50, 8/50, 2/50, 0/51) and also exceeds the range of this neoplasm in control male mice from recent NTP studies (range 0&percnt;-14&percnt;; 27/902, 3.0&percnt;). The incidence of squamous cell papilloma of the forestomach in 50 mg/kg female mice was also slightly increased (1/52, 5/50, 2/51, 2/51); however, the incidence did not exceed the NTP historical range (27/901, 3&percnt;; range, 0&percnt;-10&percnt;). GENETIC TOXICOLOGY: Coumarin induced gene mutations in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA100 in the presence, but not in the absence, of exogenous metabolic activation (S9); no mutations were induced in strains TA98, TA1535, or TA1537, with or without S9. In Chinese hamster ovary cells, coumarin induced sister chromatid exchanges in the absence of S9, and chromosomal aberrations in the presence of S9. Coumarin did not induce sex-linked recessive lethal mutations in germ cells of male Drosophila melanogaster treated either as adults by feeding or injection, or as larvae by feeding. No increase in the frequency of micronucleated erythrocytes was observed in peripheral blood of male and female B6C3F1 mice administered coumarin by gavage for 13 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of these 2-year gavage studies there was some evidence of carcinogenic activity of coumarin in male F344/N rats based on increased incidences of renal tubule adenomas. There was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of coumarin in female F344/N rats based on a marginally increased incidence of renal tubule adenomas. There was some evidence of carcinogenic activity of coumarin in male B6C3F1 mice based on the increased incidence of alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas. There was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of coumarin in female B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas, alveolar/bronchiolar carcinomas, and hepatocellular adenomas. The marginally increased incidences of squamous cell papillomas of the forestomach in male and female mice receiving 50 mg/kg may have been related to coumarin administration. The administration of coumarin to rats was also associated with an increased severity of nephropathy in the kidney and of bile duct hyperplasia in the liver, increased incidences of ulcers of the forestomach, and necrosis, fibrosis, and cytologic alteration of the liver. Administration of coumarin to mice was also associated with centrilobular hypertrophy, syncytial alteration, and eosinophilic focus in the liver.

Duplication and maintenance of the Myb genes of vertebrate animals,23431116,10.1242/bio.20123152,"Gene duplication is an important means of generating new genes. The major mechanisms by which duplicated genes are preserved in the face of purifying selection are thought to be neofunctionalization, subfunctionalization, and increased gene dosage. However, very few duplicated gene families in vertebrate species have been analyzed by functional tests in vivo. We have therefore examined the three vertebrate Myb genes (c-Myb, A-Myb, and B-Myb) by cytogenetic map analysis, by sequence analysis, and by ectopic expression in Drosophila. We provide evidence that the vertebrate Myb genes arose by two rounds of regional genomic duplication. We found that ubiquitous expression of c-Myb and A-Myb, but not of B-Myb or Drosophila Myb, was lethal in Drosophila. Expression of any of these genes during early larval eye development was well tolerated. However, expression of c-Myb and A-Myb, but not of B-Myb or Drosophila Myb, during late larval eye development caused drastic alterations in adult eye morphology. Mosaic analysis implied that this eye phenotype was cell-autonomous. Interestingly, some of the eye phenotypes caused by the retroviral v-Myb oncogene and the normal c-Myb proto-oncogene from which v-Myb arose were quite distinct. Finally, we found that post-translational modifications of c-Myb by the GSK-3 protein kinase and by the Ubc9 SUMO-conjugating enzyme that normally occur in vertebrate cells can modify the eye phenotype caused by c-Myb in Drosophila. These results support a model in which the three Myb genes of vertebrates arose by two sequential duplications. The first duplication was followed by a subfunctionalization of gene expression, then neofunctionalization of protein function to yield a c/A-Myb progenitor. The duplication of this progenitor was followed by subfunctionalization of gene expression to give rise to tissue-specific c-Myb and A-Myb genes.",2013,"Colin J Davidson, Joseph S Lipsick, Erin E Guthrie"
"Characterization of Argonaute family members in the silkworm, Bombyx mori",23955828,10.1111/j.1744-7917.2012.01555.x,"The Argonaute protein family is a highly conserved group of proteins, which have been implicated in RNA silencing in both plants and animals. Here, four members of the Argonaute family were systemically identified based on the genome sequence of Bombyx mori. Based on their sequence similarity, BmAgo1 and BmAgo2 belong to the Ago subfamily, while BmAgo3 and BmPiwi are in the Piwi subfamily. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that silkworm Argonaute family members are conserved in insects. Conserved amino acid residues involved in recognition of the 5' end of the small RNA guide strand and of the conserved (aspartate, aspartate and histidine [DDH]) motif present in their PIWI domains suggest that these four Argonaute family members may have conserved slicer activities. The results of microarray expression analysis show that there is a low expression level for B. mori Argonaute family members in different tissues and different developmental stages, except for BmPiwi. All four B. mori Argonaute family members are upregulated upon infection with B. mori nucleopolyhedrovirus. The complete coding sequence of BmPiwi, the homolog of Drosophila piwi, was cloned and its expression occurred mainly in the area where spermatogonia and spermatocytes appear. Our results provide an overview of the B. mori Argonaute family members and suggest that they may have multiple roles.

Analysis of piRNA-mediated silencing of active TEs in Drosophila melanogaster suggests limits on the evolution of host genome defense,23625890,10.1093/molbev/mst081,"The Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway defends animal genomes against the harmful consequences of transposable element (TE) infection by imposing small-RNA-mediated silencing. Because silencing is targeted by TE-derived piRNAs, piRNA production is posited to be central to the evolution of genome defense. We harnessed genomic data sets from Drosophila melanogaster, including genome-wide measures of piRNA, mRNA, and genomic abundance, along with estimates of age structure and risk of ectopic recombination, to address fundamental questions about the functional and evolutionary relationships between TE families and their regulatory piRNAs. We demonstrate that mRNA transcript abundance, robustness of ""ping-pong"" amplification, and representation in piRNA clusters together explain the majority of variation in piRNA abundance between TE families, providing the first robust statistical support for the prevailing model of piRNA biogenesis. Intriguingly, we also discover that the most transpositionally active TE families, with the greatest capacity to induce harmful mutations or disrupt gametogenesis, are not necessarily the most abundant among piRNAs. Rather, the level of piRNA targeting is largely independent of recent transposition rate for active TE families, but is rapidly lost for inactive TEs. These observations are consistent with population genetic theory that suggests a limited selective advantage for host repression of transposition. Additionally, we find no evidence that piRNA targeting responds to selection against a second major cost of TE infection: ectopic recombination between TE insertions. Our observations confirm the pivotal role of piRNA-mediated silencing in defending the genome against selfish transposition, yet also suggest limits to the optimization of host genome defense.",2013,"Erin S Kelleher, Daniel A Barbash"
Assessing the validity and reproducibility of genome-scale predictions,24048353,10.1093/bioinformatics/btt508,"Motivation: Validation and reproducibility of results is a central and pressing issue in genomics. Several recent embarrassing incidents involving the irreproducibility of high-profile studies have illustrated the importance of this issue and the need for rigorous methods for the assessment of reproducibility. Results: Here, we describe an existing statistical model that is very well suited to this problem. We explain its utility for assessing the reproducibility of validation experiments, and apply it to a genome-scale study of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR)-mediated RNA editing in Drosophila. We also introduce a statistical method for planning validation experiments that will obtain the tightest reproducibility confidence limits, which, for a fixed total number of experiments, returns the optimal number of replicates for the study.

Tertiary structural elements determine the extent and specificity of messenger RNA editing,23903876,10.1038/ncomms3232,"The specificity and extent of RNA editing by ADAR enzymes is determined largely by local primary sequence and secondary structural imperfections in duplex RNA. Here we surgically alter conserved cis elements associated with a cluster of ADAR modification sites within the endogenous Drosophila paralytic transcript. In addition to the local requirement for a central imperfect RNA duplex containing the modified adenosines, we demonstrate that a secondary RNA duplex containing splicing signals strongly modulates RNA editing. A subtle non-coding mutation, extending base pairing of this accessory helix, confers significant phenotypic consequences via effects on splicing. Through mutation/counter-mutation, we also uncover and functionally replace a highly conserved intronic long-range tertiary pseudoknot that is absolutely required for deamination of one particular adenosine in the central duplex. Our results demonstrate that complex RNA tertiary structures, which may be difficult to predict computationally, form in vivo and can regulate RNA-editing events.",2013,"Barry Hoopengardner, Cynthia J Staber, Robert A Reenan, Leila E Rieder"

Dynein associates with oskar mRNPs and is required for their efficient net plus-end localization in Drosophila oocytes,24244700,10.1371/journal.pone.0080605,"In order for eukaryotic cells to function properly, they must establish polarity. The Drosophila oocyte uses mRNA localization to establish polarity and hence provides a genetically tractable model in which to study this process. The spatial restriction of oskar mRNA and its subsequent protein product is necessary for embryonic patterning. The localization of oskar mRNA requires microtubules and microtubule-based motor proteins. Null mutants in Kinesin heavy chain (Khc), the motor subunit of the plus end-directed Kinesin-1, result in oskar mRNA delocalization. Although the majority of oskar particles are non-motile in khc nulls, a small fraction of particles display active motility. Thus, a motor other than Kinesin-1 could conceivably also participate in oskar mRNA localization. Here we show that Dynein heavy chain (Dhc), the motor subunit of the minus end-directed Dynein complex, extensively co-localizes with Khc and oskar mRNA. In addition, immunoprecipitation of the Dynein complex specifically co-precipitated oskar mRNA and Khc. Lastly, germline-specific depletion of Dhc resulted in oskar mRNA and Khc delocalization. Our results therefore suggest that efficient posterior localization of oskar mRNA requires the concerted activities of both Dynein and Kinesin-1.",2013,"Graydon B Gonsalvez, Paulomi Sanghavi, Xuan Li, Shobha Laxani, Simon L Bullock"
Functional transcriptomic analysis of the role of MAB-5/Hox in Q neuroblast migration in Caenorhabditis elegans,23642123,10.1186/1471-2164-14-304,"Background: Directed cell migration is a fundamental process in normal development and in tumor metastasis. In C. elegans the MAB-5/Hox transcription factor is a determinant of posterior migration of the Q neuroblast descendants. In this work, mab-5 transcriptional targets that control Q descendant migration are identified by comparing RNA-seq profiles in wild type and mab-5 mutant backgrounds. Results: Transcriptome profiling is a widely-used and potent tool to identify genes involved in developmental and pathological processes, and is most informative when RNA can be isolated from individual cell or tissue types. Cell-specific RNA samples can be difficult to obtain from invertebrate model organisms such as Drosophila and C. elegans. Here we test the utility of combining a whole organism RNA-seq approach with mab-5 loss and gain-of-function mutants and functional validation using RNAi to identify genes regulated by MAB-5 to control Q descendant migration. We identified 22 genes whose expression was controlled by mab-5 and that controlled Q descendant migration. Genes regulated by mab-5 were enriched for secreted and transmembrane molecules involved in basement membrane interaction and modification, and some affected Q descendant migration. Conclusions: Our results indicate that a whole-organism RNA-seq approach, when combined with mutant analysis and functional validation, can be a powerful method to identify genes involved in a specific developmental process, in this case Q descendant posterior migration. These genes could act either autonomously in the Q cells, or non-autonomously in other cells that express MAB-5. The identities of the genes regulated by MAB-5 indicate that MAB-5 acts by modifying interactions with the basement membrane, resulting in posterior versus anterior migration.",2013,"Stuart J Macdonald, Mahekta Gujar, Joel V Tamayo, Erik A Lundquist"

Selective tracking of template DNA strands after induction of mitosis with unreplicated genomes (MUGs) in Drosophila S2 cells,23681663,10.1007/s10577-013-9354-z,"According to the ""immortal"" DNA strand hypothesis (Cairns Nature 255:197-200, 1975), stem cells would keep their template strands in order to prevent the accumulation of mutations, which could occur during DNA replication. Despite the growing number of studies that attempt to test this hypothesis, the conclusions remain highly controversial. In the base of this controversy lie the current limitations of available methodology to selectively and faithfully track the fate of template DNA strands throughout and upon cell division. Here, we developed a method that allows the unequivocal tracking of single chromatids containing template DNA strands in Drosophila S2 cells in culture. This method consists in the induction of mitosis with unreplicated genomes (MUGs) in which cells are allowed to enter mitosis without prior DNA replication. This is achieved by RNAi-mediated knockdown of Double parked, a conserved protein required for the initiation of DNA replication and post-replication checkpoint response. The advantages of this system when compared with MUGs generated in mammalian cells is the preservation of chromatid morphology, the ease of loss-of-function studies and the possibility of in vivo applications. Altogether, this approach allows for the readily visualization and tracking of template DNA strands by simply monitoring cells stably expressing GFP-fusions with either Histone H2B or the centromeric Histone variant CID/CENP-A by time-lapse fluorescence microscopy. This might be useful for the dissection of the molecular mechanism behind asymmetric DNA strand segregation.",2013,"Diana Pinheiro, Helder Maiato, Marin Barisic, Danica Drpic"

Extensive polymerase pausing during Drosophila axis patterning enables high-level and pliable transcription,23699410,10.1101/gad.215459.113,"Cascades of zygotic gene expression pattern the anterior-posterior (AP) and dorsal-ventral (DV) axes of the early Drosophila embryo. Here, we used the global run-on sequencing assay (GRO-seq) to map the genome-wide RNA polymerase distribution during early Drosophila embryogenesis, thus providing insights into how genes are regulated. We identify widespread promoter-proximal pausing yet show that the presence of paused polymerase does not necessarily equate to direct regulation through pause release to productive elongation. Our data reveal that a subset of early Zelda-activated genes is regulated at the level of polymerase recruitment, whereas other Zelda target and axis patterning genes are predominantly regulated through pause release. In contrast to other signaling pathways, we found that bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) target genes are collectively more highly paused than BMP pathway components and show that BMP target gene expression requires the pause-inducing negative elongation factor (NELF) complex. Our data also suggest that polymerase pausing allows plasticity in gene activation throughout embryogenesis, as transiently repressed and transcriptionally silenced genes maintain and lose promoter polymerases, respectively. Finally, we provide evidence that the major effect of pausing is on the levels, rather than timing, of transcription. These data are discussed in terms of the efficiency of transcriptional activation required across cell populations during developmental time constraints.",2013,"Leighton J Core, Catherine Sutcliffe, Abbie Saunders, Hilary L Ashe, John T Lis"
GPI biosynthesis is essential for rhodopsin sorting at the trans-Golgi network in Drosophila photoreceptors,23250212,10.1242/dev.083683,"Sorting of integral membrane proteins plays crucial roles in establishing and maintaining the polarized structures of epithelial cells and neurons. However, little is known about the sorting mechanisms of newly synthesized membrane proteins at the trans-Golgi network (TGN). To identify which genes are essential for these sorting mechanisms, we screened mutants in which the transport of Rhodopsin 1 (Rh1), an apical integral membrane protein in Drosophila photoreceptors, was affected. We found that deficiencies in glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) synthesis and attachment processes cause loss of the apical transport of Rh1 from the TGN and mis-sorting to the endolysosomal system. Moreover, Na(+)K(+)-ATPase, a basolateral membrane protein, and Crumbs (Crb), a stalk membrane protein, were mistransported to the apical rhabdomeric microvilli in GPI-deficient photoreceptors.

Genome-wide distribution of histone H4 Lysine 16 acetylation sites and their relationship to gene expression,23587301,10.1186/2041-9414-4-3,"Background: Histone post-translational modifications are critical determinants of chromatin structure and function, impacting multiple biological processes including DNA transcription, replication, and repair. The post-translational acetylation of histone H4 at lysine 16 (H4K16ac) was initially identified in association with dosage compensation of the Drosophila male X chromosome. However, in mammalian cells, H4K16ac is not associated with dosage compensation and the genomic distribution of H4K16ac is not precisely known. Therefore, we have mapped the genome-wide H4K16ac distribution in human cells. Results: We performed H4K16ac chromatin immunoprecipitation from human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells followed by hybridization to whole-genome tiling arrays and identified 25,893 DNA regions (false discovery rate <0.005) with average length of 692 nucleotides. Interestingly, although a majority of H4K16ac sites localized within genes, only a relatively small fraction (~10%) was found near promoters, in contrast to the distribution of the acetyltransferase, MOF, responsible for acetylation at K16 of H4. Using differential gene expression profiling data, 73 genes (> ±1.5-fold) were identified as potential H4K16ac-regulated genes. Seventeen transcription factor-binding sites were significantly associated with H4K16ac occupancy (p < 0.0005). In addition, a consensus 12-nucleotide guanine-rich sequence motif was identified in more than 55% of the H4K16ac peaks. Conclusions: The results suggest that H4K16 acetylation has a limited effect on transcription regulation in HEK293 cells, whereas H4K16ac has been demonstrated to have critical roles in regulating transcription in mouse embryonic stem cells. Thus, H4K16ac-dependent transcription regulation is likely a cell type specific process.",2013,"Girdhar G Sharma, Shantanu Chowdhury, Tej K Pandita, Kenneth Westover, Pankaj Kumar, Clayton R Hunt, Min Chen, Nobuo Horikoshi"
Effects of overexpression of mitochondrial transcription factor A on lifespan and oxidative stress response in Drosophila melanogaster,23206694,10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.11.084,"Mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) plays a role in the maintenance of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) by packaging mtDNA, forming the mitochondrial nucleoid. There have been many reports about a function of TFAM at the cellular level, but only a few studies have been done in individual organisms. Here we examined the effects of TFAM on the Drosophila lifespan and oxidative stress response, by overexpressing TFAM using the GAL4/UAS system. Under standard conditions, the lifespan of TFAM-overexpressing flies was shorter than that of the control flies. However, the lifespan of TFAM-overexpressing flies was longer when they were treated with 1% H(2)O(2). These results suggest that even though excess TFAM has a negative influence on lifespan, it has a defensive function under strong oxidative stress. In the TFAM-overexpressing flies, no significant changes in mtDNA copy number or mtDNA transcription were observed. However, the results of a total antioxidant activity assay suggest the possibility that TFAM is involved in the elimination of oxidative stress. The present results clearly show the effects of TFAM overexpression on the lifespan of Drosophila under both standard conditions and oxidative stress conditions, and our findings contribute to the understanding of the physiological mechanisms involving TFAM in mitochondria.",2013,"Etsuko T Matsuura, Dongchon Kang, Teiichi Tanimura, Takako Matsuda, Tomotake Kanki"

An unknown protease in the expression system cleaved the recombinant AChE2 next to Arg(110), yielding two non-covalently associated polypeptides. A mixture of the intact and cleaved AChE2 had a specific activity of 72.3 U/mg, much lower than that of A. gambiae AChE1 (523 U/mg). The order of V(max)/K(M) values for the model substrates was acetylthiocholine > propionylthiocholine ≈ acetyl-(β-methyl)thiocholine > butyrylthiocholine.

Quantitative polymerase chain reactions showed a similar pattern of ace-1 and ace-2 expression. Their mRNAs were abundant in early embryos, greatly decreased in late embryos, larvae, pupae, and pharate adult, and became abundant again in adults. Both transcripts were higher in head and abdomen than thorax of adults and higher in male than female mosquitoes. Transcript levels of ace-1 were 1.9- to 361.8-fold higher than those of ace-2, depending on developmental stages and body parts. Cross-reacting polyclonal antibodies detected AChEs in adult brains, thoracic ganglia, and genital/rectal area. Activity assays, immunoblotting, and tandem mass spectrometric analysis indicated that A. gambiae AChE1 is responsible for most of acetylthiocholine hydrolysis in the head extracts.

AurA directly phosphorylates Drok in vitro, and the overexpression of the nonphosphorylatable forms of Drok in vivo causes similar, but much stronger effects than that of wild-type Drok. The defects induced by the nonphosphorylatable forms of Drok are compensated by reducing the function of myosin downstream. Thus, phosphorylation of Drok by AurA normally suppresses Drok activity.

The alpha' subunit encoded by the CKA2 gene is 60% identical to the CKA1-encoded alpha subunit and 55% identical to the Drosophila alpha subunit (A. Saxena, R. Padmanabha, and C. V. C. Glover, Mol. Cell. Biol. 7:3409-3417, 1987). Deletions of the CKA2 gene were constructed by gene replacement techniques. Haploid cells in which the CKA2 gene alone is disrupted show no detectable phenotype, but haploid cells carrying disruptions in both the CKA1 and CKA2 genes are inviable. Cells in which casein kinase II activity is depleted increase substantially in size prior to growth arrest, and a significant fraction of the arrested cells exhibit a pseudomycelial morphology. Disruption of the activity also results in flocculation. Yeast strains lacking both endogenous catalytic subunit genes can be rescued by expression of the alpha and beta subunits of Drosophila casein kinase II or by expression of the Drosophila alpha subunit alone, suggesting that casein kinase II function has been conserved through evolution.",1990,"C V Glover, J L Chen-Wu, D E Hanna, R Padmanabha"
A genetic basis for the inviability of hybrids between sibling species of Drosophila,2108905,,"A mutation of Drosophila melanogaster whose only known effect is the rescue of otherwise lethal interspecific hybrids has been characterized. This mutation, Hmr, maps to 1-31.84 (9D1-9E4). Hmr may be the consequence of a P element insertion. It rescues hybrid males from the cross of D. melanogaster females to males of its three sibling species, D. simulans, D. mauritiana and D. sechellia. This rescue is recessive, since hybrid males that carry both Hmr and a duplication expected to be Hmr+ are not rescued. Hmr also rescues the otherwise inviable female hybrids from the cross of compound-X D. melanogaster females to males of its sibling species. This rescue is also recessive, since a compound-X heterozygous for Hmr does not rescue. Another mutation, discovered on the In(1)AB chromosome of D. melanogaster, is also found to rescue normally inviable species hybrids: unlike Hmr, however, In(1)AB rescues hybrid females from the cross of In(1)AB/Y males to sibling females, as well as hybrid males from the cross of In(1)AB females to sibling males. These data are interpreted on the basis of a model for the genetic basis of hybrid inviability of complementary genes.",1990,"P Hutter, M Ashburner, J Roote"
"Heat sensitivity and protein synthesis during heat-shock in the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta",2292612,10.1007/BF01075665,"Fifth instar larvae of the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta, tolerate 1-h exposures to temperatures as high as 42 degrees C. Above 42 degrees C, survival declines rapidly to 18% at 44 degrees C and 0% at 48 degrees C. As in other insects, the heat-shock response of Manduca sexta involves the induction of synthesis of heat-shock proteins very similar in size to the Drosophila heat-shock proteins (84, 73, 71, 27, 25, 23, and 22 kd). In the epidermis, heat-shock protein synthesis peaks at 42 degrees C, correlating with the heat sensitivity of both the tissue itself and the intact larva. Some heat-shock proteins have different isoelectric forms depending on tissue. Also, the heat-shock proteins are synthesized over a wider range of temperatures in the imaginal discs and the fat body as compared to the epidermis. In contrast to dipteran insects, Manduca sexta does not exhibit a strong repression of non-heat-shock protein synthesis under tolerable conditions.",1990,"L M Riddiford, C M Fittinghoff"
Opsin of Calliphora peripheral photoreceptors R1-6. Homology with Drosophila Rh1 and posttranslational processing,1698782,,"The rhodopsin and metarhodopsin states of two very distantly related fly species (Calliphora and Drosophila) are found to exhibit no species-specific differences in their absorbance spectra. Isolation and characterization of cDNAs encoding the major opsin of Calliphora reveal a high (86%) degree of amino acid identity with the corresponding Drosophila visual pigment. Completely conserved is the third cytoplasmic loop which displays the major structural differences with the vertebrate photopigments. Other conserved motifs are six potential phosphorylation sites in the C-terminal region of the molecule and two potential glycosylation sites in the extracellular domains at positions Asn18 and Asn194, respectively. Interestingly, unlike vertebrate visual pigments, only newly synthesized fly opsin is N-glycosylated, while the mature protein is not. The conserved structure of the cytoplasmic loops suggests that the molecular mechanism for the activation of the transduction cascade is precisely the same in Drosophila and in Calliphora. Thus, data obtained by investigating the biochemistry of rhodopsin-related processes in larger flies may be integrated with the results of genetic experiments in Drosophila into a common model of invertebrate phototransduction.",1990,"R Paulsen, A Huber, D P Smith, C S Zuker"

It is also specifically amplified in ovarian follicles; this is the first report of chorion gene amplification outside the genus Drosophila. Alignments of s36 sequences from three species show that, in addition to its regulatory conservation, the s36 gene is extensively conserved in sequence, in a region corresponding to a central protein domain, and in short regions of 5' flanking DNA that might correspond to cis-regulatory elements.",1990,"F C Kafatos, P P Tolias, K Komitopoulou, C Swimmer, D L King, M Konsolaki"

Cloning of the mitochondrial genome of Anopheles quadrimaculatus,2134168,10.1002/arch.940140104,"The entire 15 kilobase (kb) Anopheles quadrimaculatus mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was cloned as three EcoRI fragments in a bacteriophage vector and then subcloned into plasmid vectors. The cloned DNA was physically mapped with restriction endonucleases, and the maps were compared to the restriction patterns of native A. quadrimaculatus mtDNA. Several genes were mapped by sequencing the ends of A. quadrimaculatus mtDNA subclones and by hybridization with the previously characterized Aedes albopictus mtDNA clones. These portions of the genetic map were identical in gene order to those of Drosophila yakuba. The predicted amino acid sequence of the protein coding regions that were sequenced were between 72% and 98% homologous to D. yakuba.

Genetic variation for oviposition behavior in Drosophila melanogaster. I. Quantitative genetic analysis of insertion behavior,2126925,10.1007/BF01065876,"The genetic basis of egg insertion behavior was analyzed in two Drosophila melanogaster strains (N and E strain), which were homozygous for the Slow allele of the alcohol dehydrogenase locus. The E strain had been selected for increased tolerance to ethanol. This study originated from the observation that nearly all of the eggs laid by females of the E strain were inserted, while in the control strain (N strain) which was kept on regular food, considerable variation for egg insertion occurred. Crosses between the E and the N strains were made, and quantitative genetic tests were performed. It was shown that the inheritance of egg insertion is polygenic, some of the genes are probably sex linked, and in-laying is partly dominant over on-laying. The heritability of the trait, derived from mother-daughter regression analysis, was .59 +/- .18. The repeatability was high. Bidirectional selection in the E strain was unsuccessful, but an asymmetrical response to selection was obtained in the N strain and in lines derived from crosses between the N and the E strains. Selection for in-laying was more successful than for on-laying. The realized heritability in the former lines was .35 +/- .10.",1990,"W van Delden, A Kamping"
"Multiple, compensatory regulatory elements specify spermatocyte-specific expression of the Drosophila melanogaster hsp26 gene",2104657,10.1128/mcb.10.1.131,"The hsp26 gene of Drosophila melanogaster is expressed in six tissues during development and in a tissue-general response to heat shock. To be able to compare tissue-specific and heat-induced mechanisms of hsp26 expression, we have begun an analysis of the sequences involved in the spermatocyte-specific expression of the hsp26 gene by using germ line transformation. hsp26 mRNA synthesized in the spermatocytes has the same start site as sites previously demonstrated for nurse cell-specific and heat-induced mRNAs. Three regions of the hsp26 gene (nucleotides -351 to -135, -135 to -85, and +11 to +632) were able to stimulate spermatocyte-specific expression when fused with promoter sequences (nucleotides -85 to +11) that alone were insufficient to stimulate expression. These stimulatory regions appear to contain elements that provide redundant functions. While each region was able to stimulate expression independently, the deletion of any one region from a construct was without consequence as long as another compensatory region(s) was still present. There must reside, at a minimum, two independent spermatocyte-specifying elements within the sequences that encompass the three stimulatory regions and the promoter. At least one element is contained within sequences from -351 to -48. This region, in either orientation, can stimulate spermatocyte-specific expression from a heterologous promoter. A second element must reside in sequences from -52 to +632, since these sequences are also sufficient to direct spermatocyte-specific expression.",1990,"J T Lis, R L Glaser"
Developmental expression of Drosophila melanogaster small heat-shock proteins,2121748,,"We have investigated the developmental expression of the small heat-shock proteins (hsps) during embryogenesis and in adult flies by immunocytology using an antibody that specifically identifies the small hsps. Antibody staining of unstressed early embryos reveals a predominantly cytoplasmic, homogeneous distribution of the small hsps throughout the embryo. At 6h of development small hsp expression can be identified in large, neuroblast-like cells within the extended germ band and in the brain of the embryo. During germ band contraction these cells appear to migrate to the midline where they align pairwise in a segmental pattern. After germ band contraction is complete a high level of small hsp expression can be observed in the midline glia (MECs) and in a cluster of six non-neuronal cells within the midline. In contrast to several other genes that are known to be important for embryogenesis and are expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) of embryos, CNS-specific expression of the small hsps is not restricted to the embryo but is also observed in the adult fly. In adult flies strong small hsp expression is observed in the brain, the thoracic ganglion and the leg nerves. Since the small hsps seem to be expressed predominantly in the glia of the nervous system, our data suggest a protective or stabilizing function of the small hsps within the nervous system during normal fly development, which is independent of the stress response.",1990,"U Klein, P M Kloetzel, C Haass"
Cloning and expression of the cDNA for a Drosophila insulin-degrading enzyme,2126597,10.1210/mend-4-10-1580,"We have previously identified and characterized a metalloproteinase from Drosophila that cleaves insulin and transforming growth factor-alpha, but not epidermal growth factor, at physiological concentrations. On the basis of enzymatic properties and substrate specificity, this enzyme was identified as the Drosophila homolog of the mammalian insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE). We now report the cloning and sequencing of the cDNA coding for the Drosophila IDE (dIDE). Northern blot analysis indicates that the dIDE is translated from a 3.6-kilobase transcript similar in size to one of the two human IDE transcripts. The gene for the dIDE has been mapped to chromosome 3L (77B). The sequence of the dIDE is very similar to that of the human IDE, and both enzymes share limited but significant identity with the bacterial metalloproteinase protease III. Indirect studies based upon inhibitors, degradation products, and microinjected antibodies have suggested that the IDE can initiate cellular insulin degradation in mammalian cells. To determine whether dIDE expressed in mammalian cells can also degrade insulin, we transfected the cDNA into murine NIH3T3 cells. Extracts of the transfected cells showed increased insulin-degrading activity, demonstrating that the dIDE can be functionally expressed in mammalian cells. These results indicate that the properties of the IDE are evolutionarily conserved.",1990,"B D Gehm, W L Kuo, M R Rosner"
A dual function of the Notch gene in Drosophila sensillum development,2227090,10.1016/0012-1606(90)90147-b,"We have investigated the function of the neurogenic gene Notch (N) during development of the adult sensilla of Drosophila. Heat pulses were applied to flies carrying the temperature-sensitive Notch allele Nts1 at different larval and pupal stages. We can show that the reduction of Notch+ function during a short interval prior to the onset of sensillum precursor division, resulting from a heat pulse between 0 and 14 hr after puparium formation (apf), leads to an increase in microchaete precursors at the expense of epidermal cells. The structure and cellular composition of the sensilla produced by these supernumerary precursors are normal. Later heat pulses which include the interval immediately after sensillum precursor division (14-20 hr apf) lead, among the progeny of the sensillum precursors, to a hyperplasia of sensory neurons, at the expense of accessory cells. The resulting ""sensilla"" consist of neurons only and lack the external cuticular structures (i.e., shaft, socket). These results demonstrate that similar mechanisms both of which involve the function of the Notch gene may be operating to sort out (premitotic) sensillum precursors from epidermal precursors and (postmitotic) sensory neurons from accessory cells. They further show that in postmitotic sensillum cells the differentiative fate is not yet irreversibly fixed, but presumably requires cell-cell interaction to become established.",1990,"J W Posakony, V Hartenstein"

Terminal DNA fragments are heterogeneous in length. Molecular cloning and sequencing of the terminal DNA fragments revealed that the broken ends of the deleted chromosomes do not carry any telomeric DNA sequences, yet the broken chromatids do not fuse to one another. Moreover, we confirmed by sequence analysis of 49 independently cloned terminal DNA fragments from two RT lines collected at different times that they lose DNA sequences from their distal ends at a rate of 70-75 base pairs per fly generation. We calculate that the rate of loss from these ends is consistent with the removal of an octanucleotide RNA primer at each round of DNA replication in the germ line.",1990,"S B Carter, J M Mason, H Biessmann"

G., et al., 1992, Nature 357, 38-46). We have tested the predictive power of computer sequence analysis of the 176 probable protein products of this chromosome, after exclusion of six problem cases. When the results of database similarity searches are pooled with prior knowledge, a likely function can be assigned to 42% of the proteins, and a predicted three-dimensional structure to a third of these (14% of the total). The function of the remaining 58% remains to be determined. Of these, about one-third have one or more probable transmembrane segments. Among the most interesting proteins with predicted functions are a new member of the type X polymerase family, a transcription factor with an N-terminal DNA-binding domain related to GAL4, a ""fork head"" DNA-binding domain previously known only in Drosophila and in mammals, and a putative methyltransferase. Our analysis increased the number of known significant sequence similarities on chromosome III by 13, to now 67. Although the near 40% success rate of identifying unknown protein function by sequence analysis is surprisingly high, the information gap between known protein sequences and unknown function is expected to widen and become a major bottleneck of genome projects in the near future. Based on the experience gained in this test study, we suggest that the development of an automated computer workbench for protein sequence analysis must be an important item in genome projects.",1992,"C Ouzounis, R Schneider, C Sander, M Scharf, E Sonnhammer, P Bork"

"deadpan, an essential pan-neural gene encoding an HLH protein, acts as a denominator in Drosophila sex determination",1525829,10.1016/0092-8674(92)90242-5,"In Drosophila, sex is determined by the X:A ratio. One major numerator element on the X chromosome is sisterless-b (sis-b), also called scute, which encodes an HLH-type transcription factor. We report here that an essential pan-neural gene, the autosomal HLH gene deadpan (dpn), acts as a denominator element. As revealed by dosage-dependent dominant interactions, males die with too high a ratio of sc+ to dpn+, caused by misexpression of Sex lethal (Sxl) in embryos, and females die with too low a ratio of sc+ to dpn+, because of altered embryonic Sxl expression. In addition, we found that the HLH gene extramacrochaetae (emc), like daughterless (da), is needed maternally for proper communication of the X:A ratio, thus supporting the idea that a set of HLH genes comprises a functional cassette that makes a sensitive and stable genetic switch used in both neural determination and sex determination.",1992,"H Vaessin, L Y Jan, Y N Jan, E Bier, S Younger-Shepherd"

Moreover, sequence similarities between drosophila developmental genes and mammalian growth factors provide evidence for common ancestors of such genes and suggest a complex link between growth and differentiation. As numerous oncogenes display their action as growth factors and are expressed during embryogenesis, differentiation and oncogenesis seem to be two sides of the same coin. Therefore, the aim of molecular embryology is twofold; elucidating differentiation processes and disclosing oncogenesis by studying the physiological function of oncogenes during development. Recent progress in molecular genetic technology now allows gene function to be studied by modification or disruption of genes. Models of clinical diseases have already evolved from such work and it is anticipated that progress in molecular embryology will further stimulate work on the diagnosis and therapy of genetic diseases as well as clinical oncology.",1992,R K Schmutzler
A BamHI repeat element is predominantly associated with the degenerating neo-Y chromosome of Drosophila miranda but absent in the Drosophila melanogaster genome,1311096,10.1073/pnas.89.4.1340,"In Drosophila miranda, females have two X1 and two evolving X2 chromosomes, and males have one of each of these two X chromosomes and a Y chromosome. In males, the homologue of the X2 chromosome, the neo-Y chromosome, is attached to the Y chromosome and is under the process of degenerative evolution. We have examined a developmentally regulated X2/neo-Y chromosome-linked gene, 549mr, of D. miranda and found that the neo-Y chromosome-linked copy of this gene (549mr-NY) contains an insertional DNA. We discovered that sequences similar to those in the insertional DNA are present in multiple copies in the genome of both sexes of D. miranda but are more abundant in the males. The insertional DNA also identified a 1.1-kilobase BamHI repeat that is present in at least 6-fold excess in the male genome as compared to the female. This BamHI repeat and similar DNA sequences are predominantly concentrated on the evolving neo-Y chromosome, but very few are found on the homologous X2 and other chromosomes. The BamHI repeat also hybridizes with 2.0- and 1.8-kb RNAs and many other RNA species, which together are also approximately 6-fold greater in males. No sequences similar to the BamHI repeat are found in Drosophila melanogaster. Moreover, the BamHI repeat is not homologous to P, copia, or other D. melanogaster transposable elements.

Characterization of a LINE retroposon dispersed in the genome of three non-sibling Aedes mosquito species,1327974,10.1016/0378-1119(92)90092-4,"A family of long interspersed repetitive elements (LINEs) dispersed in the genome of Aedes mosquitoes is described. Basically, full-length copies of the element designated Juan-A are dispersed in the genome of A. aegypti, but some elements are truncated or deleted. Complete Juan-A elements are 4.7 kb long, and their overall genetic organization is similar to that of LINEs from other species in which this class of nonviral retrotransposons has been described. Juan-A elements are terminated at the 3' end by an adenosine(A)-rich sequence and are flanked by target-site duplications. They display two long open reading frames potentially encoding two polypeptides. The first one contains Cys-rich motifs typical of nucleic-acid-binding proteins, while the other shows homology to the reverse transcriptases. These features are characteristic of LINE retroposons and indicate that Juan-A elements can be transposed by reverse transcription of an RNA intermediate. Furthermore, Juan-A retroposons display significant homologies with the Drosophila LINEs Jockey and F, suggesting that all these elements have arisen from a common precursor. The full-length Juan-A copies which are amplified in the genomes of various strains belonging to the three non-sibling species, A. aegypti, A. albopictus and A. polynesiensis, form an internally homogeneous family. These data are interpreted to indicate that active Juan-A retroposons underwent a recent amplification in the strains analyzed.

The rate and pattern of nucleotide substitution in Drosophila mitochondrial DNA,1528108,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a040763,"The nucleotide sequences of a segment of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have been determined for nine species or subspecies of the subgenus Drosophila of the genus Drosophila. This segment contains two complete protein-coding genes (i.e., NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1 and cytochrome b) and a transfer RNA gene (tRNA(ser)). The G+C content at third-codon positions for the two protein-coding genes was 1.5 times higher than that in the D. melanogaster species group, which belongs to the subgenus Sophophora. However, there was a substantial difference between the nucleotide frequencies of G and C. The number of nucleotide substitutions per silent site was more than three times higher than that for nuclear DNA, although it was only 60% of that for mammalian mtDNA. Both parametric and nonparametric analyses revealed a strong transition-transversion bias in nucleotide substitution, as was observed in mammalian mtDNA. Moreover, the rate of substitution of A and T for G and C is higher than that for the opposite direction. This bias seems to be responsible for the extremely A+T-rich base composition of Drosophila mtDNA. It is also noted that the rate of transitional change between A and G is higher than that between T and C.",1992,K Tamura
Rates of synonymous substitution and base composition of nuclear genes in Drosophila,1582562,,"We compared the rates of synonymous (silent) substitution among various genes in a number of species of Drosophila. First, we found that even for a particular gene, the rate of synonymous substitution varied considerably with Drosophila lineages. Second, we showed a large variation in synonymous substitution rates among nuclear genes in Drosophila. These rates of synonymous substitution were correlated negatively with C content and positively with A content at the third codon positions. Nucleotide sequences were also compared between pseudogenes and their functional homologs. The C content of the pseudogenes was lower than that of the functional genes and the A content of the former was higher than that of the latter. Because the synonymous substitution for functional genes and the nucleotide substitution for pseudogenes are exempted from any selective constraint at the protein level, these observations could be explained by a biased pattern of mutation in the Drosophila nuclear genome. Such a bias in the mutation pattern may affect the molecular clock (local clock) of each nuclear gene of each species. Finally, we obtained the average rates of synonymous substitution for three gene groups in Drosophila; 11.0 x 10(-9), 17.5 x 10(-9) and 27.1 x 10(-9)/site/year.",1992,"T Gojobori, E N Moriyama"

This finding clearly indicates that the yield of these mutations is greatly enhanced in the c3G female-ywmf-2 male system.

The role of the teashirt gene in trunk segmental identity in Drosophila,1360402,,"The phenotypes of different mutant combinations of teashirt (tsh) and homeotic genes together with their regulatory interactions are described in order to gain insight into tsh gene function. We show that when tsh, Scr, Antp and BX-C genes are missing, the ventral part of the trunk (or thorax and abdomen) is transformed to anterior head identity showing that tsh is a homeotic gene. These genes act synergistically to suppress the expression of the procephalic gene labial (lab) in subsets of cells in each segment of the trunk. Transcripts from the tsh gene always accumulate in segments destined to acquire trunk identities. tsh gene activity is required for the normal function of the Antp and BX-C genes, which modulate in part the expression of tsh. As a whole, our results suggest that tsh plays an essential dual role, during embryogenesis, for determining segmental identity of the trunk. First, tsh is required critically for the identity of the anterior prothorax. Second, tsh is required globally for segmental identity throughout the entire trunk whereas the ""classical"" homeotic genes have more specific roles. Our results are consistent with the idea that tsh is defining the ground state of the Drosophila trunk region seen in the absence of the Antp and BX-C genes.",1992,"S Kerridge, L Röder, C Vola"
Reduced neuronal sensitivity to dieldrin and picrotoxinin in a cyclodiene-resistant strain of Drosophila melanogaster (Meigen),1311215,10.1002/arch.940190103,"Toxicological and neurophysiological studies were performed to characterize the resistance mechanism in a cyclodiene-resistant strain of Drosophila melanogaster (Maryland strain). Dieldrin had an LC50 of 0.058 ppm against the larvae of susceptible D. melanogaster (Oregon-R wild type) when formulated in the rearing media. The LC50 of the resistant Maryland strain was 10.8 ppm, giving a resistance ratio (LC50-Maryland/LC50-susceptible) of 186-fold. Suction electrode recordings were made from peripheral nerves of the larval central nervous system to test whether reduced nerve sensitivity played any role in the observed resistance. In susceptible preparations (n = 5), inhibition of nerve firing by 1 mM gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) was effectively antagonized within 3-10 min by 10 microM dieldrin. In contrast, 30 min incubations with 10 microM dieldrin had no effect on preparations from cyclodiene-resistant individuals (n = 5). Similarly, 10 microM picrotoxinin blocked GABA-dependent inhibition in susceptible nerve preparations (n = 3). In recordings from resistant insects (n = 4), picrotoxinin displayed either weak antagonism of GABA or hyperexcitation indistinguishable from susceptible preparations. These results demonstrate that cyclodiene resistance in the Maryland strain of D. melanogaster 1) is expressed in immature stages, 2) is present at the level of the nerve, and 3) extends to picrotoxinin, albeit at a reduced level compared with dieldrin. The possible role of an altered GABA receptor in this resistance is discussed.",1992,"J R Bloomquist, R H ffrench-Constant, R T Roush"
Seven genes of the Enhancer of split complex of Drosophila melanogaster encode helix-loop-helix proteins,1427040,,"Enhancer of split [E(spl)] is one of the neurogenic loci of Drosophila and, as such, is required for normal segregation of neural and epidermal cell progenitors. Genetic observations indicate that the E(spl) locus is in fact a gene complex comprising a cluster of related genes and that other genes of the region are also required for normal early neurogenesis. Three of the genes of the complex were known to encode helix-loop-helix (HLH) proteins and to be transcribed in nearly identical patterns. Here, we show that four other genes in the vicinity also encode HLH proteins and, during neuroblast segregation, three of them are expressed in the same pattern. We show by germ-line transformation that these three genes are also necessary to allow epidermal development of the neuroectodermal cells.",1992,"F Grawe, E Knust, J A Campos-Ortega, H Schrons"
Examination of the DNA sequence-specific binding properties of heat shock transcription factor in Xenopus laevis embryos,1297327,10.1139/o92-144,"The binding of heat shock transcription factor (HSF) to the heat shock element (HSE) is necessary for transcriptional activation of eukaryotic heat shock protein (HSP) genes. The properties of Xenopus embryo HSF were examined by DNA mobility shift analysis employing a synthetic oligonucleotide corresponding to the proximal HSE in the promoter of the Xenopus HSP70B gene. Heat shock induced activation of HSF binding in Xenopus neurulae was not affected by an inhibition of protein synthesis, indicating that the mode of activation may be posttranslational. Also, while HSF binding was activated in control Drosophila cell extracts by in vitro heat shock or other chemical treatments, HSF binding in Xenopus embryo or somatic cell extract was not. Thus, the activation of Xenopus HSE-HSF binding may occur via a different mechanism compared with Drosophila. Furthermore, we determined that the native size of heat-induced HSF in pre- and post-midblastula stage Xenopus embryos is approximately 530 kilodaltons (kDa), which corresponds to a hexamer made up of 88 kDa monomers. Finally, the slower accumulation of HSP70 mRNA to peak levels found at lower heat shock temperatures was not correlated with HSE-HSF binding activity.",1992,"H Karn, N Ovsenek, J J Heikkila"
Activatable Photosensitizer for Targeted Ablation of lacZ-Positive Cells with Single-Cell Resolution,31660435,10.1021/acscentsci.9b00678,"To achieve highly selective ablation of lacZ-positive cells in a biological milieu in vivo, we developed an activatable photosensitizer, SPiDER-killer-βGal, targeted to β-galactosidase encoded by the lacZ reporter gene. Hydrolysis of SPiDER-killer-βGal by β-galactosidase simultaneously activates both its photosensitizing ability and its reactivity to nucleophiles, so that the phototoxic products generated by light irradiation are trapped inside the lacZ-positive cells. The combination of SPiDER-killer-βGal and light irradiation specifically killed lacZ-positive cells in coculture with cells without lacZ expression. Furthermore, β-galactosidase-expressing cells in the posterior region of cultured Drosophila wing discs and in pupal notum of live Drosophila pupae were selectively killed with single-cell resolution.

Microinjection Techniques in Fly Embryos to Study the Function and Dynamics of SMC Complexes,31147923,10.1007/978-1-4939-9520-2_19,"Structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) proteins are critical to maintain mitotic fidelity in all organisms. Over the last decades, acute inactivation of these complexes, together with the analysis of their dynamic binding to mitotic chromatin, has provided important insights on the molecular mechanism of these complexes as well as into the consequences of their failure at different stages of mitosis.Here, we describe a methodology to study both SMC function and dynamics using Drosophila melanogaster syncytial embryos. This system presents several advantages over canonical inactivation or imaging approaches. Efficient and fast inactivation of SMC complexes can be achieved by the use of tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease in vivo to cleave engineered versions of the SMC complexes. In contrast to genetically encoded TEV protease expression, Drosophila embryos enable prompt delivery of the protease by microinjection techniques, as detailed here, thereby allowing inactivation of the complexes within few minutes. Such an acute inactivation approach, when coupled with real-time imaging, allows for the analysis of the immediate consequences upon protein inactivation. As described here, this system also presents unique advantages to follow the kinetics of the loading of SMC complexes onto mitotic chromatin. We describe the use of Drosophila embryos to study localization and turnover of these molecules through live imaging and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) approaches.",2019,"Catarina Carmo, Raquel A Oliveira, Margarida Araújo"
Conserved regulation of neurodevelopmental processes and behavior by FoxP in Drosophila,30753188,10.1371/journal.pone.0211652,"FOXP proteins form a subfamily of evolutionarily conserved transcription factors involved in the development and functioning of several tissues, including the central nervous system. In humans, mutations in FOXP1 and FOXP2 have been implicated in cognitive deficits including intellectual disability and speech disorders. Drosophila exhibits a single ortholog, called FoxP, but due to a lack of characterized mutants, our understanding of the gene remains poor. Here we show that the dimerization property required for mammalian FOXP function is conserved in Drosophila. In flies, FoxP is enriched in the adult brain, showing strong expression in ~1000 neurons of cholinergic, glutamatergic and GABAergic nature. We generate Drosophila loss-of-function mutants and UAS-FoxP transgenic lines for ectopic expression, and use them to characterize FoxP function in the nervous system. At the cellular level, we demonstrate that Drosophila FoxP is required in larvae for synaptic morphogenesis at axonal terminals of the neuromuscular junction and for dendrite development of dorsal multidendritic sensory neurons. In the developing brain, we find that FoxP plays important roles in α-lobe mushroom body formation. Finally, at a behavioral level, we show that Drosophila FoxP is important for locomotion, habituation learning and social space behavior of adult flies. Our work shows that Drosophila FoxP is important for regulating several neurodevelopmental processes and behaviors that are related to human disease or vertebrate disease model phenotypes. This suggests a high degree of functional conservation with vertebrate FOXP orthologues and established flies as a model system for understanding FOXP related pathologies.",2019,"Sheren Christine, Lisa van Ninhuijs, Simon E Fisher, Christine Quentin, Radoslaw Ejsmont, Anne F Simon, Falko Hofmann, Dova B Brenman-Suttner, Jamie M Kramer, Anna Castells-Nobau, Rosa L Schellevis, Ilse Eidhof, Annette Schenck, Kiran van der Laan, Michaela Fenckova, Jolanda M Scheffer-de Gooyert, Stephan J Sigrist"
On the Regulatory Evolution of New Genes Throughout Their Life History,30395322,10.1093/molbev/msy206,"Every gene has a birthplace and an age, that is, a cis-regulatory environment and an evolution lifespan since its origination, yet how the two shape the evolution trajectories of genes remains unclear. Here, we address this basic question by comparing phylogenetically dated new genes in the context of both their ages and origination mechanisms. In both Drosophila and vertebrates, we confirm a clear ""out of the testis"" transition from the specifically expressed young genes to the broadly expressed old housekeeping genes, observed only in testis but not in other tissues. Many new genes have gained important functions during embryogenesis, manifested as either specific activation at maternal-zygotic transition, or different spatiotemporal expressions from their parental genes. These expression patterns are largely driven by an age-dependent evolution of cis-regulatory environment. We discover that retrogenes are more frequently born in a pre-existing repressive regulatory domain, and are more diverged in their enhancer repertoire than the DNA-based gene duplications. During evolution, new gene duplications gradually gain active histone modifications and undergo more enhancer turnovers when becoming older, but exhibit complex trends of gaining or losing repressive histone modifications in Drosophila or vertebrates, respectively. Interestingly, vertebrate new genes exhibit an ""into the testis"" epigenetic transition that older genes become more likely to be co-occupied by both active and repressive (""bivalent"") histone modifications specifically in testis. Our results uncover the regulatory mechanisms underpinning the stepwise acquisition of novel and complex functions by new genes, and illuminate the general evolution trajectory of genes throughout their life history.",2019,"Qi Zhou, Jia-Yu Zhang"
Stromalin Constrains Memory Acquisition by Developmentally Limiting Synaptic Vesicle Pool Size,30503644,10.1016/j.neuron.2018.11.003,"Stromalin, a cohesin complex protein, was recently identified as a novel memory suppressor gene, but its mechanism remained unknown. Here, we show that Stromalin functions as a negative regulator of synaptic vesicle (SV) pool size in Drosophila neurons. Stromalin knockdown in dopamine neurons during a critical developmental period enhances learning and increases SV pool size without altering the number of dopamine neurons, their axons, or synapses. The developmental effect of Stromalin knockdown persists into adulthood, leading to strengthened synaptic connections and enhanced olfactory memory acquisition in adult flies. Correcting the SV content in dopamine neuron axon terminals by impairing anterograde SV trafficking motor protein Unc104/KIF1A rescues the enhanced-learning phenotype in Stromalin knockdown flies. Our results identify a new mechanism for memory suppression and reveal that the size of the SV pool is controlled genetically and independent from other aspects of neuron structure and function through Stromalin.",2019,"Connon I Thomas, Jacob A Berry, Naomi Kamasawa, Anna Phan, Molee Chakraborty, Ronald L Davis"

We show that the role of the salvage pathway in Wnt signaling is evolutionarily conserved in zebrafish and Drosophila. Finally, we show that GlcNAc is essential for the growth of intestinal enteroids, which are highly dependent on Wnt signaling for growth and maintenance. We propose that the Wnt pathway is sensitive to alterations in the glycosylation state of a cell and acts as a nutritional sensor in order to couple growth/proliferation with its metabolic status.

Interactions Between Mitochondrial Haplotype and Dietary Macronutrient Ratios Confer Sex-Specific Effects on Longevity in Drosophila melanogaster,31044222,10.1093/gerona/glz104,"Recent studies have demonstrated that modifications to the ratio of dietary macronutrients affect longevity in a diverse range of species. However, the degree to which levels of natural genotypic variation shape these dietary effects on longevity remains unclear. The mitochondria have long been linked to the aging process. The mitochondria possess their own genome, and previous studies have shown that mitochondrial genetic variation affects longevity in insects. Furthermore, the mitochondria are the sites in which dietary nutrients are oxidized to produce adenosine triphosphate, suggesting a capacity for dietary quality to mediate the link between mitochondrial genotype and longevity. Here, we measured longevity of male and female fruit flies, across a panel of genetic strains of Drosophila melanogaster, which vary only in their mitochondrial haplotype, when fed one of the two isocaloric diets that differed in their protein-to-carbohydrate ratio. The mitochondrial haplotype affected the longevity of flies, but the pattern of these effects differed across the two diets in males, but not in females. We discuss the implications of these results in relation to an evolutionary theory linking maternal inheritance of mitochondria to the accumulation of male-harming mitochondrial mutations, and to the theory exploring the evolution of phenotypic plasticity to novel environments.",2019,"John Hunt, James Rapkin, Venkatesh Nagarajan-Radha, Damian K Dowling"

Results: The individuals in our cohort carried 2 deletions, 8 likely gene-disruptive, 2 splice-site, and 20 different missense variants, most of them de novo. Two cases were familial. The associated phenotype was of variable severity extending from mild developmental delay or normal IQ to severe intellectual disability. Feeding difficulties and behavioral abnormalities were common, and variable other findings including growth restriction and cardiac defects were observed. RNA-sequencing in five individuals identified 3828 deregulated genes enriched for known NDD genes and biological processes such as transcriptional regulation. Ctcf dosage alteration in Drosophila resulted in impaired gross neurological functioning and learning and memory deficits.

"Oviposition Preference and Larval Performance of Drosophila suzukii (Diptera: Drosophilidae), Spotted-Wing Drosophila: Effects of Fruit Identity and Composition",31157861,10.1093/ee/nvz062,"A better understanding of the factors affecting host plant use by spotted-wing drosophila (Drosophila suzukii) could aid in the development of efficient management tools and practices to control this pest. Here, proxies of both preference (maternal oviposition behavior) and performance (adult emergence) were evaluated for 12 different fruits in the form of purees. The effect of the chemical composition of the fruits on preference and performance traits was then estimated. We synthesized the literature to interpret our findings in the light of previous studies that measured oviposition preference and larval performance of D. suzukii. We show that fruit identity influences different parts of the life cycle, including oviposition preference under both choice and no-choice conditions, emergence rate, development time, and number of emerging adults. Blackcurrant was always among the most preferred fruit we used, while grape and tomato were the least preferred fruits. Larvae performed better in cranberry, raspberry, strawberry, and cherry than in the other fruits tested. We found that fruit chemical compounds can explain part of the effect of fruit on D. suzukii traits. In particular, oviposition preference under choice conditions was strongly influenced by fruit phosphorus content. In general, the consensus across studies is that raspberry, blackberry, and strawberry are among the best hosts while blackcurrant, grape and rose hips are poor hosts. Our results generally confirm this view but also suggest that oviposition preferences do not necessarily match larval performances.

Induction and Suppression of NF-κB Signalling by a DNA Virus of Drosophila,30404807,10.1128/JVI.01443-18,"Interactions between the insect immune system and RNA viruses have been extensively studied in Drosophila, in which RNA interference, NF-κB, and JAK-STAT pathways underlie antiviral immunity. In response to RNA interference, insect viruses have convergently evolved suppressors of this pathway that act by diverse mechanisms to permit viral replication. However, interactions between the insect immune system and DNA viruses have received less attention, primarily because few Drosophila-infecting DNA virus isolates are available. In this study, we used a recently isolated DNA virus of Drosophila melanogaster, Kallithea virus (KV; family Nudiviridae), to probe known antiviral immune responses and virus evasion tactics in the context of DNA virus infection. We found that fly mutants for RNA interference and immune deficiency (Imd), but not Toll, pathways are more susceptible to Kallithea virus infection. We identified the Kallithea virus-encoded protein gp83 as a potent inhibitor of Toll signalling, suggesting that Toll mediates antiviral defense against Kallithea virus infection but that it is suppressed by the virus. We found that Kallithea virus gp83 inhibits Toll signalling through the regulation of NF-κB transcription factors. Furthermore, we found that gp83 of the closely related Drosophila innubila nudivirus (DiNV) suppresses D. melanogaster Toll signalling, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved function of Toll in defense against DNA viruses. Together, these results provide a broad description of known antiviral pathways in the context of DNA virus infection and identify the first Toll pathway inhibitor in a Drosophila virus, extending the known diversity of insect virus-encoded immune inhibitors.IMPORTANCE Coevolution of multicellular organisms and their natural viruses may lead to an intricate relationship in which host survival requires effective immunity and virus survival depends on evasion of such responses. Insect antiviral immunity and reciprocal virus immunosuppression tactics have been well studied in Drosophila melanogaster, primarily during RNA, but not DNA, virus infection. Therefore, we describe interactions between a recently isolated Drosophila DNA virus (Kallithea virus [KV]) and immune processes known to control RNA viruses, such as RNA interference (RNAi) and Imd pathways. We found that KV suppresses the Toll pathway and identified gp83 as a KV-encoded protein that underlies this suppression. This immunosuppressive ability is conserved in another nudivirus, suggesting that the Toll pathway has conserved antiviral activity against DNA nudiviruses, which have evolved suppressors in response. Together, these results indicate that DNA viruses induce and suppress NF-κB responses, and they advance the application of KV as a model to study insect immunity.",2019,"Darren J Obbard, Pascal W Jansen, Gijs J Overheul, William H Palmer, Ronald P Van Rij, Joep Joosten, Michiel Vermeulen"
Dynamic Evolution of Antimicrobial Peptides Underscores Trade-Offs Between Immunity and Ecological Fitness,31781114,10.3389/fimmu.2019.02620,"There is a developing interest in how immune genes may function in other physiological roles, and how traditionally non-immune peptides may, in fact, be active in immune contexts. In the absence of infection, the induction of the immune response is costly, and there are well-characterized trade-offs between immune defense and fitness. The agents behind these fitness costs are less understood. Here we implicate antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) as particularly costly effectors of immunity using an evolutionary framework. We describe the independent loss of AMPs in multiple lineages of Diptera (true flies), tying these observations back to life history. We then focus on the intriguing case of the glycine-rich AMP, Diptericin, and find several instances of loss, pseudogenization, and segregating null alleles. We suggest that Diptericin may be a particularly toxic component of the Dipteran immune response lost in flies either with reduced pathogen pressure or other environmental factors. As Diptericins have recently been described to have neurological roles, these findings parallel a developing interest in AMPs as potentially harmful neuropeptides, and AMPs in other roles beyond immunity.",2019,"Bruno Lemaitre, Robert L Unckless, Mark A Hanson"
AMP Kinase Activation is Selectively Disrupted in the Ventral Midbrain of Mice Deficient in Parkin or PINK1 Expression,30411223,10.1007/s12017-018-8517-7,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative movement disorder that is characterized pathologically by the progressive loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) of the midbrain. Despite intensive research, the etiology of PD remains poorly understood. Interestingly, recent studies have implicated neuronal energy dysregulation as one of the key perpetrators of the disease. Supporting this, we have recently demonstrated that pharmacological or genetic activation of AMP kinase (AMPK), a master regulator of cellular energy homeostasis, rescues the pathological phenotypes of Drosophila models of PD. However, little is known about the role of AMPK in the mammalian brain. As an initial attempt to clarify this, we examined the expression of AMPK in rodent brains and found that phospho-AMPK (pAMPK) is disproportionately distributed in the adult mouse brain, being high in the ventral midbrain where the SN resides and relatively lower in regions such as the cortex-reflecting perhaps the unique energy demands of midbrain DA neurons. Importantly, the physiologically higher level of midbrain pAMPK is significantly reduced in aged mice and also in Parkin-deficient mice; the loss of function of which in humans causes recessive Parkinsonism. Not surprisingly, the expression of PGC-1α, a downstream target of AMPK activity, and a key regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, mirrors the expression pattern of pAMPK. Similar observations were made with PINK1-deficient mice. Finally, we showed that metformin administration restores the level of midbrain pAMPK and PGC-1α expression in Parkin-deficient mice. Taken together, our results suggest that the disruption of AMPK-PGC-1α axis in the brains of individuals with Parkin or PINK1 mutations may be a precipitating factor of PD, and that pharmacological AMPK activation may represent a neuroprotective strategy for the disease.",2019,"Geraldine W Y Goh, John Thundyil, Liting Hang, Kah-Leong Lim"
Parcas is the predominant Rab11-GEF for rhodopsin transport in Drosophila photoreceptors,31296556,10.1242/jcs.231431,"Rab11 is essential for polarized post-Golgi vesicle trafficking to photosensitive membrane rhabdomeres in Drosophila photoreceptors. Here, we found that Parcas (Pcs), recently shown to have guanine nucleotide exchange (GEF) activity toward Rab11, co-localizes with Rab11 on the trans-side of Golgi units and post-Golgi vesicles at the base of the rhabdomeres in pupal photoreceptors. Pcs fused with the electron micrography tag APEX2 localizes on 150-300 nm vesicles at the trans-side of Golgi units, which are presumably fly recycling endosomes. Loss of Pcs impairs Rab11 localization on the trans-side of Golgi units and induces the cytoplasmic accumulation of post-Golgi vesicles bearing rhabdomere proteins, as observed in Rab11 deficiency. In contrast, loss of Rab11-specific subunits of the TRAPPII complex, another known Rab11-GEF, does not cause any defects in eye development nor the transport of rhabdomere proteins; however, simultaneous loss of TRAPPII and Pcs results in severe defects in eye development. These results indicate that both TRAPPII and Pcs are required for eye development, but Pcs functions as the predominant Rab11-GEF for post-Golgi transport to photosensitive membrane rhabdomeres.",2019,"Yuna Otsuka, Takunori Satoh, Ryota Inaba, Hitomi Yamashita, Akiko K Satoh, Nozomi Nakayama"
Drosophila anion exchanger 2 is required for proper ovary development and oogenesis,31071312,10.1016/j.ydbio.2019.04.018,"Understanding how cell fate decisions are regulated is a central question in stem cell biology. Recent studies have demonstrated that intracellular pH (pHi) dynamics contribute to this process. Indeed, the pHi of cells within a tissue is not simply a consequence of chemical reactions in the cytoplasm and other cellular activity, but is actively maintained at a specific setpoint in each cell type. We found previously that the pHi of cells in the follicle stem cell (FSC) lineage in the Drosophila ovary increases progressively during differentiation from an average of 6.8 in the FSCs, to 7.0 in newly produced daughter cells, to 7.3 in more differentiated cells. Two major regulators of pHi in this lineage are Drosophila sodium-proton exchanger 2 (dNhe2) and a previously uncharacterized gene, CG8177, that is homologous to mammalian anion exchanger 2 (AE2). Based on this homology, we named the gene anion exchanger 2 (ae2). Here, we generated null alleles of ae2 and found that homozygous mutant flies are viable but have severe defects in ovary development and adult oogenesis. Specifically, we find that ae2 null flies have smaller ovaries, reduced fertility, and impaired follicle formation. In addition, we find that the follicle formation defect can be suppressed by a decrease in dNhe2 copy number and enhanced by the overexpression of dNhe2, suggesting that this phenotype is due to the dysregulation of pHi. These findings support the emerging idea that pHi dynamics regulate cell fate decisions and our studies provide new genetic tools to investigate the mechanisms by which this occurs.",2019,"Diane L Barber, Marimar Benitez, Todd G Nystul, Yi Liu, Sumitra Tatapudy"

To investigate these issues in Drosophila, we assayed behavior as well as molecular rhythms within individual brain clock neurons while blocking communication within the ca. 150 neuron clock network. We also generated CRISPR-mediated neuron-specific circadian clock knockouts. The results point to two key clock neuron groups: loss of the clock within both regions but neither one alone has a strong behavioral phenotype in darkness; communication between these regions also contributes to circadian period determination. Under these dark conditions, the clock within one region persists without network communication. The clock within the famous PDF-expressing s-LNv neurons however was strongly dependent on network communication, likely because clock gene expression within these vulnerable sLNvs depends on neuronal firing or light.",2019,"Michael Rosbash, Madelen M Díaz, Jason Xin, Matthias Schlichting"
Multi-modal and multiscale imaging approaches reveal novel cardiovascular pathophysiology in Drosophila melanogaster,31455664,10.1242/bio.044339,"Establishing connections between changes in linear DNA sequences and complex downstream mesoscopic pathology remains a major challenge in biology. Herein, we report a novel, multi-modal and multiscale imaging approach for comprehensive assessment of cardiovascular physiology in Drosophila melanogaster We employed high-speed angiography, optical coherence tomography (OCT) and confocal microscopy to reveal functional and structural abnormalities in the hdp2 mutant, pre-pupal heart tube and aorta relative to controls. hdp2 harbor a mutation in wupA, which encodes an ortholog of human troponin I (TNNI3). TNNI3 variants frequently engender cardiomyopathy. We demonstrate that the hdp2 aortic and cardiac muscle walls are disrupted and that shorter sarcomeres are associated with smaller, stiffer aortas, which consequently result in increased flow and pulse wave velocities. The mutant hearts also displayed diastolic and latent systolic dysfunction. We conclude that hdp2 pre-pupal hearts are exposed to increased afterload due to aortic hypoplasia. This may in turn contribute to diastolic and subtle systolic dysfunction via vascular-heart tube interaction, which describes the effect of the arterial loading system on cardiac function. Ultimately, the cardiovascular pathophysiology caused by a point mutation in a sarcomeric protein demonstrates that complex and dynamic micro- and mesoscopic phenotypes can be mechanistically explained in a gene sequence- and molecular-specific manner.",2019,"Michael A Choma, Anthony Cammarato, Constance G Weismann, Stephan M Jonas, Joyce Li, Anna Blice-Baum, Brendan K Huang, Tangji Tong"

We show that the null sov phenotype is lethal and map the locus to the uncharacterized gene CG14438, which encodes a nuclear zinc-finger protein that colocalizes with the essential Heterochromatin Protein 1 (HP1a). We demonstrate Sov functions to repress inappropriate gene expression in the ovary, silence transposons, and suppress position-effect variegation in the eye, suggesting a central role in heterochromatin stabilization.",2019,"Leif Benner, Dorothy A Lerit, Haiwang Yang, Brian Oliver, Kevin R Cook, Koen J T Venken, Junnan Fang, Elias A Castro, Cale Whitworth"
The histone demethylase KDM5 controls developmental timing in Drosophila by promoting prothoracic gland endocycles,31862793,10.1242/dev.182568,"In Drosophila, the larval prothoracic gland integrates nutritional status with developmental signals to regulate growth and maturation through the secretion of the steroid hormone ecdysone. While the nutritional signals and cellular pathways that regulate prothoracic gland function are relatively well studied, the transcriptional regulators that orchestrate the activity of this tissue remain less characterized. Here, we show that lysine demethylase 5 (KDM5) is essential for prothoracic gland function. Indeed, restoring kdm5 expression only in the prothoracic gland in an otherwise kdm5 null mutant animal is sufficient to rescue both the larval developmental delay and the pupal lethality caused by loss of KDM5. Our studies show that KDM5 functions by promoting the endoreplication of prothoracic gland cells, a process that increases ploidy and is rate limiting for the expression of ecdysone biosynthetic genes. Molecularly, we show that KDM5 activates the expression of the receptor tyrosine kinase torso, which then promotes polyploidization and growth through activation of the MAPK signaling pathway. Taken together, our studies provide key insights into the biological processes regulated by KDM5 and expand our understanding of the transcriptional regulators that coordinate animal development.",2019,"Michael F Rogers, Helen M Belalcazar, Coralie Drelon, Julie Secombe"
Brain and bone cancer targeting by a ferrofluid composed of superparamagnetic iron-oxide/silica/carbon nanoparticles (earthicles),30711662,10.1016/j.actbio.2019.01.064,"Despite the advances in molecularly targeted therapies, delivery across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the targeting of brain tumors remains a challenge. Like brain, bone is a common site of metastasis and requires therapies capable of discerning the tumor from its healthy cellular milieu. To tackle these challenges, we made a variation on the previously proposed concept of the earthicle and fabricated an aqueous, surfactant-free ferrofluid containing superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) coated with silicate mesolayers and carbon shells, having 13 nm in size on average. Nanoparticles were synthesized hydrothermally and characterized using a range of spectroscopic, diffractometric, hydrodynamic and electron microscopy techniques. The double coating on SPIONs affected a number of physicochemical and biological properties, including colloidal stability and cancer targeting efficacy. Nanoparticles decreased the viability of glioblastoma and osteosarcoma cells and tumors more than that of their primary and non-transformed analogues. They showed a greater preference for cancer cells because of a higher rate of uptake by these cells and a pronounced adherence to cancer cell membrane. Even in an ultralow alternate magnetic field, nanoparticles generated sufficient heat to cause tumor death. Nanoparticles in MDCK-MDR1 BBB model caused mislocalization of claudin-1 at the tight junctions, underexpression of ZO-1 and no effect on occludin-1 and transepithelial resistance. Nanoparticles were detected in the basolateral compartments and examination of LAMP1 demonstrated that nanoparticles escaped the lysosome, traversed the BBB transcellularly and localized to the optic lobes of the third instar larval brains of Drosophila melanogaster. The passage was noninvasive and caused no adverse systemic effects to the animals. In conclusion, these nanoparticulate ferrofluids preferentially bind to cancer cells and, hence, exhibit a greater toxicity in these cells compared to the primary cells. They are also effective against solid tumors in vitro, can cross the BBB in Drosophila, and are nontoxic based on the developmental studies of flies raised in ferrofluid-infused media. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: We demonstrate that a novel, hydrothermally synthesized composite nanoparticle-based ferrofluid is effective in reducing the viability of osteosarcoma and glioblastoma cells in vitro, while having minimal effects on primary cell lines. In 3D tumor spheroids, nanoparticles greatly reduced the metastatic migration of cancer cells, while the tumor viability was reduced compared to the control group by applying magnetic hyperthermia to nanoparticle-treated spheroids. Both in vitro and in vivo models of the blood-brain barrier evidence the ability of nanoparticles to cross the barrier and localize to the brain tissue. These composite nanoparticles show great promise as an anticancer biomaterial for the treatment of different types of cancer and may serve as an alternative or addendum to traditional chemotherapies.",2019,"Sean Tang, Vuk Uskoković, Victoria M Wu, Eric Huynh"
The ATPase TER94 regulates Notch signaling during Drosophila wing development,30530809,10.1242/bio.038984,"The evolutionarily conserved Notch signaling pathway plays crucial roles in various developmental contexts. Multiple mechanisms are involved in the regulation of Notch pathway activity. Identified through a genetic mosaic screen, we show that the ATPase TER94 acts as a positive regulator of Notch signaling during Drosophila wing development. Depletion of TER94 causes marginal notches in the adult wing and the reduction of Notch target genes wingless and cut during wing margin formation. We provide evidence that TER94 is likely required for proper Notch protein localization and activation. Furthermore, we show that knockdown of the TER94 adaptor p47 leads to similar Notch signaling defects. Although the TER94 complex is implicated in various cellular processes, its role in the regulation of Notch pathways was previously uncharacterized. Our study demonstrates that TER94 positively regulates Notch signaling and thus reveals a novel role of TER94 in development.This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper.",2019,"Junzheng Zhang, Yunlong Li, Tong Liu"
"mag-1, a homolog of Drosophila mago nashi, regulates hermaphrodite germ-line sex determination in Caenorhabditis elegans",10656761,10.1006/dbio.1999.9593,"The Caenorhabditis elegans gene mag-1 can substitute functionally for its homolog mago nashi in Drosophila and is predicted to encode a protein that exhibits 80% identity and 88% similarity to Mago nashi (P. A. Newmark et al., 1997, Development 120, 3197-3207). We have used RNA-mediated interference (RNAi) to analyze the phenotypic consequences of impairing mag-1 function in C. elegans. We show here that mag-1(RNAi) causes masculinization of the germ line (Mog phenotype) in RNA-injected hermaphrodites, suggesting that mag-1 is involved in hermaphrodite germ-line sex determination. Epistasis analysis shows that ectopic sperm production caused by mag-1(RNAi) is prevented by loss-of-function (lf) mutations in fog-2, gld-1, fem-1, fem-2, fem-3, and fog-1, all of which cause germ-line feminization in XX hermaphrodites, but not by a her-1(lf) mutation which causes germ-line feminization only in XO males. These results suggest that mag-1 interacts with the fog, fem, and gld genes and acts independently of her-1. We propose that mag-1 normally allows oogenesis by inhibiting function of one or more of these masculinizing genes, which act during the fourth larval stage to promote transient sperm production in the hermaphrodite germ line. When the Mog phenotype is suppressed by a fog-2(lf) mutation, mag-1(RNAi) also causes lethality in the progeny embryos of RNA-injected, mated hermaphrodites, suggesting an essential role for mag-1 during embryogenesis. The defective embryos arrest during morphogenesis with an apparent elongation defect. The distribution pattern of a JAM-1::GFP reporter, which is localized to boundaries of hypodermal cells, shows that hypodermis is disorganized in these embryos. The temporal expression pattern of the mag-1 gene prior to and during morphogenesis appears to be consistent with an essential role of mag-1 in embryonic hypodermal organization and elongation.",2000,"R Boswell, W B Wood, W Li"
Phylogenetic analysis of the repleta species group of the genus Drosophila using multiple sources of characters,10942616,10.1006/mpev.2000.0824,"The species in the repleta group of the genus Drosophila have been placed into five subgroups-the mulleri, hydei, mercatorum, repleta, and fasciola subgroups. Each subgroup has been further subdivided into complexes and clusters. Extensive morphological and cytological analyses of the members of this species group have formed the foundation for the proposed relationships among the members of the repleta species group. Fifty-four taxa, including 46 taxa belonging to the repleta species group, were sequenced for fragments of four genes-16S ribosomal DNA (16S), cytochrome oxidase II (COII), and nitrogen dehydrogenase 1 (ND1) of the mitochondrial genome and a region of the hunchback (hb) nuclear gene. We also generated a partial data set of elongation factor 1-alpha (Ef1alpha) sequences for a subset of taxa. Our analysis used both DNA characters and chromosomal inversion data. The phylogenetic hypothesis we obtained supports many of the traditionally accepted clades within the mulleri subgroup, but the monophyly of taxonomic groups outside of this subgroup appears not to be supported. Phylogenetic analysis revealed one well-supported, highly resolved clade that consists of closely related members of the mulleri and buzzatii complexes. The remaining taxa, a wide assortment of taxonomic groups, ranging from members of other species groups to members of several subgroups and members of three species complexes from the mulleri subgroup are found in poorly supported arrangements at the base of the tree.",2000,"R H Baker, C M Durando, W B Heed, W J Etges, M Wasserman, R DeSalle"

Purified recombinant hCKI epsilon (but not a kinase negative mutant of hCKI epsilon, hCKI epsilon-K38R) phosphorylated hPER I in vitro. When co-transfected with wild-type hCKI epsilon, in 293T cells, hPER I showed a significant increase in phosphorylation as evidenced by a shift in molecular mass. Furthermore, phosphorylation of hPER I by hCKI epsilon caused a decrease in protein stability in hPER I. Whereas phosphorylated hPER I had a half-life of approximately 12 h, unphosphorylated hPER I remained stable in the cell for > 24 h. hPER I protein could also be co-immunoprecipitated with transfected hCKI epsilon as well as endogenous hCKI epsilon, indicating physical association between hPER I and hCKI epsilon proteins in vivo.",2000,"G A Keesler, Y Guo, F Camacho, Z Yao, C Mondadori, D Virshup"
The mus308 locus of Drosophila melanogaster is implicated in the bypass of ENU-induced O-alkylpyrimidine adducts,10732683,10.1007/s004380050041,"The mus308 locus of D. melanogaster was originally characterized by virtue of a mutant phenotype that resulted in specific hypersensitivity to cross-linking agents. However, the gene product has also been implicated in the repair of lesions other than cross-links. The gene was recently sequenced, and it encodes a protein with motifs characteristic of both DNA polymerases and helicases. We present mutability studies, using the recessive lethal (RL) test, which show that N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) induces hypermutability in mus308-deficient conditions, although only in early broods. Further studies elucidated the role of MUS308 in repair processes by characterizing the spectrum of molecular mutations induced by in vivo ENU in postmeiotic germ cells, in mus308 conditions. These revealed that, in comparison to repair-proficient conditions, there is an increase in the frequency of GC --> AT and AT --> GC transitions, and AT --> TA transversions. Moreover, frameshift mutations, which have not previously been reported to form part of the ENU spectrum, were also found. These results indicate that MUS308 is needed to process ENU-induced lesions, and support the hypothesis that the mus308 gene plays a role in post-replication bypass of O-alkylpyrimidines, probably mediated by recombination, which serves to increase the time available for error-free repair of these persistent and highly mutagenic lesions.",2000,"M A Comendador, L Tosal, L M Sierra"
Aspartyl beta -hydroxylase (Asph) and an evolutionarily conserved isoform of Asph missing the catalytic domain share exons with junctin,10956665,10.1074/jbc.M006753200,"The mouse aspartyl beta-hydroxylase gene (Asph, BAH) has been cloned and characterized. The mouse BAH gene spans 200 kilobase pairs of genomic DNA and contains 24 exons. Of three major BAH-related transcripts, the two largest (6,629 and 4,419 base pairs) encode full-length protein and differ only in the use of alternative polyadenylation signals. The smallest BAH-related transcript (2,789 base pairs) uses an alternative 3' terminal exon, resulting in a protein lacking a catalytic domain. Evolutionary conservation of this noncatalytic isoform of BAH (humbug) is demonstrated in mouse, man, and Drosophila. Monoclonal antibody reagents were generated, epitope-mapped, and used to definitively correlate RNA bands on Northern blots with protein species on Western blots. The gene for mouse junctin, a calsequestrin-binding protein, was cloned and characterized and shown to be encoded from the same locus. When expressed in heart tissue, BAH/humbug preferably use the first exon and often the fourth exon of junctin while preserving the reading frame. Thus, three individual genes share common exons and open reading frames and use separate promoters to achieve differential expression, splicing, and function in a variety of tissues. This unusual form of exon sharing suggests that the functions of junctin, BAH, and humbug may be linked.",2000,"G F Hollis, S P Ho, K T O'Neil, J E Dinchuk, J Link, R Huber, M S Scully, J M Hollis, R J Focht, N L Henderson, P A Friedman, T C Burn"

Evidence that members of the Cut/Cux/CDP family may be involved in AER positioning and polarizing activity during chick limb development,11060239,,"In vertebrates, the apical ectodermal ridge (AER) is a specialized epithelium localized at the dorsoventral boundary of the limb bud that regulates limb outgrowth. In Drosophila, the wing margin is also a specialized region located at the dorsoventral frontier of the wing imaginal disc. The wingless and Notch pathways have been implicated in positioning both the wing margin and the AER. One of the nuclear effectors of the Notch signal in the wing margin is the transcription factor cut. Here we report the identification of two chick homologues of the Cut/Cux/CDP family that are expressed in the developing limb bud. Chick cux1 is expressed in the ectoderm outside the AER, as well as around ridge-like structures induced by (&bgr;)-catenin, a downstream target of the Wnt pathway. cux1 overexpression in the chick limb results in scalloping of the AER and limb truncations, suggesting that Cux1 may have a role in limiting the position of the AER by preventing the ectodermal cells around it from differentiating into AER cells. The second molecule of the Cut family identified in this study, cux2, is expressed in the pre-limb lateral plate mesoderm, posterior limb bud and flank mesenchyme, a pattern reminiscent of the distribution of polarizing activity. The polarizing activity is determined by the ability of a certain region to induce digit duplications when grafted into the anterior margin of a host limb bud. Several manipulations of the chick limb bud show that cux2 expression is regulated by retinoic acid, Sonic hedgehog and the posterior AER. These results suggest that Cux2 may have a role in generating or mediating polarizing activity. Taking into account the probable involvement of Cut/Cux/CDP molecules in cell cycle regulation and differentiation, our results raise the hypothesis that chick Cux1 and Cux2 may act by modulating proliferation versus differentiation in the limb ectoderm and polarizing activity regions, respectively.",2000,"A T Tavares, T Tsukui, J C Izpisúa Belmonte"

The period E-box is sufficient to drive circadian oscillation of transcription in vivo,11106063,10.1177/074873040001500603,"The minimum element from the Drosophila period promoter capable of driving in vivo cycling mRNA is the 69 bp circadian regulatory sequence (CRS). In cell culture, an 18 bp E-box element from the period promoter is regulated by five genes that are involved in the regulation of circadian expression in flies. This E-box is a target for transcriptional activation by bHLH-PAS proteins dCLOCK (dCLK) and CYCLE (CYC), this activation is inhibited by PERIOD (PER) and TIMELESS (TIM) together, and inhibition of dCLK/CYC by PER and TIM is blocked by CRYPTOCHROME (CRY) in the presence of light. Here, the same 18 bp E-box region generated rhythmic expression of luciferase in flies under both light-dark cycling and constant conditions. Flies heterozygous for the Clke(jrk) mutation maintained rhythmic expression from the E-box although at a lower level than wild type. Homozygous mutant Clk(jrk) animals had drastically lowered and arrhythmic expression. In a per01 background, expression from the E-box was high and not rhythmic. Transcription mediated by the per E-box was restricted to the same spatial pattern as the CRS. The per E-box DNA element and cognate binding proteins can confer per-like temporal and spatial expression. This demonstrates in vivo that the known circadian genes that form the core of the circadian oscillator in Drosophila integrate their activities at a single DNA element.",2000,"P E Hardin, S A Kay, T K Darlington, L C Lyons"
Molecular mechanism and cellular distribution of insect circadian clocks,10761596,10.1146/annurev.ento.45.1.769,"Circadian clocks are endogenous timing mechanisms that control molecular, cellular, physiological, and behavioral rhythms in all organisms from unicellulars to humans. Circadian rhythms influence many aspects of insect biology, finetuning life functions to the light and temperature cycles associated with the solar day.

Periodic transcription and translation of these clock genes form the basis of a molecular feedback loop that has a ""circa"" 24-hour period. Rhythmic expression of clock genes in specific brain neurons appears to control behavioral rhythms in adult flies. However, clock genes are also expressed in other tissues, both within and outside of the nervous system.

Temporal and spatial expression of the cell-cycle regulator cul-1 in Drosophila and its stimulation by radiation-induced apoptosis,10952875,,"Cul-1 protein is part of the ubiquitin ligase complex that is conserved from yeast to humans.

Although in both these organisms the cul-1 gene executes essentially the same function, the manifestation of its lack-of-function mutations differs considerably. In yeast the mutation causes arrest at the G(1)/S-phase transition, whereas in nematodes excessive cell divisions occur because mutant cells are unable to exit the mitotic cycle. We isolated cul-1 orthologues from two model organisms, Drosophila melanogaster and mouse. We show that the Drosophila full-length cul-1 gene restores the yeast mutant's inability to pass through the G(1)/S-phase transition. We also characterize expression of this gene at the transcript and protein levels during Drosophila development and show that cul-1 gene is maternally supplied as a protein, but not as an RNA transcript. Zygotic transcription of the gene, however, resumes at early stages of embryogenesis.

Here, for the first time, we examine the functions of Cdc42 in developing tissues using loss-of-function mutations in the Drosophila Cdc42 gene. We find that Cdc42(-) epithelial cells fail to elongate into a columnar cell shape and cannot maintain a monolayered epithelial structure. In contrast to previous studies, we find no requirement for Cdc42 in cell division or in activation of the Jun N-terminal kinase pathway. In addition, Cdc42 function is not required for cytoplasmic actin filament assembly in the nurse cells during oogenesis, although it may facilitate this process. Furthermore, our results indicate that Cdc42 plays a role in intercellular interactions between the germ line and the somatic follicle cells.

In the present paper, we screened the Berkeley ""Drosophila Genome Project"" database with ""electronic probes"" corresponding to the conserved regions of the four rat (delta, kappa, mu, nociceptin/orphanin FQ) opioid receptors. This yielded alignment with a Drosophila genomic database clone that contained a DNA sequence coding for a protein having, again, structural similarities with the rat galanin receptors.

Misexpression of Gcm causes crystal cells to be transformed into plasmatocytes.

Htra2-beta 1 stimulates an exonic splicing enhancer and can restore full-length SMN expression to survival motor neuron 2 (SMN2),10931943,10.1073/pnas.160181697,"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a common motor neuron disease in humans, results from loss of functional survival motor neuron (SMN1) alleles. A nearly identical copy of the gene, SMN2, fails to provide protection from SMA because of a single translationally silent nucleotide difference in exon 7. This likely disrupts an exonic splicing enhancer and causes exon 7 skipping, leading to abundant production of a shorter isoform, SMN2Delta7. The truncated transcript encodes a less stable protein with reduced self-oligomerization activity that fails to compensate for the loss of SMN1. This report describes the identification of an in vivo regulator of SMN mRNA processing. Htra2-beta1, an SR-like splicing factor and ortholog of Drosophila melanogaster transformer-2, promoted the inclusion of SMN exon 7, which would stimulate full-length SMN2 expression. Htra2-beta1 specifically functioned through and bound an AG-rich exonic splicing enhancer in SMN exon 7. This effect is not species-specific as expression of Htra2-beta1 in human or mouse cells carrying an SMN2 minigene dramatically increased production of full-length SMN2. This demonstrates that SMN2 mRNA processing can be modulated in vivo. Because all SMA patients retain at least one SMN2 copy, these results show that an in vivo modulation of SMN RNA processing could serve as a therapeutic strategy to prevent SMA.",2000,"Y Hofmann, S Stamm, C L Lorson, B Wirth, E J Androphy"

Titin is a giant sarcomeric protein responsible for the elasticity of striated muscle. Titin may also function as a molecular scaffold during myofibril assembly.

The extended spatial distribution of the neuronal Golgi apparatus, particularly in spinal motorneurons, allowed the confocal immunohistochemical colocalization of mST3GalV with markers for medial/trans-Golgi but not the cis-Golgi or trans-Golgi network, consistent with previous observations suggesting that ganglioside glycosyltransferases are enriched in late Golgi compartments. Among non-neural tissues, liver and testes demonstrate cell-type specific CS2 staining. In liver, endothelial cells lining a ring of sinusoids, concentric with the central vein, express mST3GalV. Kupffer cells are also stained with CS2 antiserum but hepatocyte expression is undetectable. In the seminiferous tubules of the testes, ST3GalV is found in somatic (Leydig, Sertoli) and early germline cells (spermatogonia and primary spermatocytes); the epididymal epithelium exhibits intense ST3GalV expression. Since GM3 is a precursor for the synthesis of a- and b-series gangliosides, the range of mST3GalV/GM3 synthase expression among various cell populations indicates that certain cell types possess greater reliance on ganglioside function than others.",2000,"T R Braverman, C A Stern, M Tiemeyer"

Transcriptional activity of Drosophila melanogaster ecdysone receptor isoforms and ultraspiracle in Saccharomyces cerevisiae,10750019,10.1677/jme.0.0240183,"The Drosophila melanogaster ecdysone receptor (EcR) is produced in three isoforms, which mediate developmental processes such as metamorphosis. These isoforms were expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to elucidate aspects of receptor transcription activity in a highly defined genetic model system. All three EcR isoforms showed ligand-independent transcriptional activation of an ecdysone reporter gene and the amount of activation correlated with the size of the N-terminal A/B (transactivation) domain present in the isoform: EcR-B1>EcR-A>>EcR-B2. Upon co-expression with ultraspiracle (Usp), transcriptional activation was further increased with EcR-B1 or EcR-A, but was unchanged with EcR-B2 or a truncated EcR lacking the A/B N-terminal domain (EcRDeltaA/B). Thus, the enhanced activity from Usp may depend on the presence of an N-terminal domain of EcR. Co-expression with Usp of several chimeric receptors of the EcR and the mouse androgen receptor (mAR) identified one chimera, composed of the mAR N-terminus and the remainder from EcR (mAR¿EcR-CDEF) that was transcriptionally silent and inducible by Usp. In contrast, the vertebrate homologue, human retinoic acid receptor (RXRalpha), showed ligand-independent transcription when co-expressed with EcRDeltaA/B but not mAR¿ EcR-CDEF. Therefore, RXRalpha does not require its partner to possess an N-terminal domain, yet is intolerant of a heterologous N-terminus. Similarly, the human vitamin D receptor, which has a short N-terminal region, showed greater ligand-independent transcription in the presence of RXRalpha than in the presence of Usp. These results reveal a mechanistic basis for the differential activities among the EcR isoforms, and between Usp and RXRalpha. Furthermore, they provided the foundation for a genetic screen to identify potential insecticides as well as accessory proteins for Usp and EcR.",2000,"F E Dela Cruz, J N Heinrich, D R Kirsch"

A reexamination of spreading of position-effect variegation in the white-roughest region of Drosophila melanogaster,10628986,,"In Drosophila, heterochromatin causes mosaic silencing of euchromatic genes brought next to it by chromosomal rearrangements. Silencing has been observed to ""spread"": genes closer to the heterochromatic rearrangement breakpoint are silenced more frequently than genes farther away. We have examined silencing of the white and roughest genes in the variegating rearrangements In(1)w(m4), In(1)w(mMc), and In(1)w(m51b). Eleven stocks bearing these chromosomes differ widely in the strength of silencing of white and roughest. Stock-specific differences in the relative frequencies of inactivation of white and roughest were found that map to the white-roughest region or the adjacent heterochromatin. Most stock-specific differences did not correlate with gross differences in the heterochromatic content of the rearranged chromosomes; however, two stocks, In(1)w(m51b) and In(1)w(mMc), were found to have anomalous additional heterochromatin that may act in trans to suppress variegating alleles. In comparing different stocks, the frequency of silencing of the roughest gene, which is more distant from heterochromatin, does not correlate with the frequency of silencing of the more proximal white gene on the same chromosome, in contradiction to the expectation of models of continuous linear propagation of silencing. We frequently observed rough eye tissue that is pigmented, as though an active white gene is skipped.",2000,"P B Talbert, S Henikoff"
Divergence of larval morphology between Drosophila sechellia and its sibling species caused by cis-regulatory evolution of ovo/shaven-baby,10781057,10.1073/pnas.97.9.4530,"We report an extreme morphological difference between Drosophila sechellia and related species of the pattern of hairs on first-instar larvae. On the dorsum of most species, the posterior region of the anterior compartment of most segments is covered by a carpet of fine hairs. In D. sechellia, these hairs have been lost and replaced with naked cuticle. Genetic mapping experiments and interspecific complementation tests indicate that this difference is caused, in its entirety, by evolution at the ovo/shaven-baby locus. The pattern of expression of the ovo/shaven-baby transcript is correlated with this morphological change. The altered dorsal cuticle pattern is probably caused by evolution of the cis-regulatory region of ovo/shaven-baby in the D. sechellia lineage.",2000,"E Sucena, D L Stern"

Identification and validation of a gene involved in anchorage-independent cell growth control using a library of randomized hairpin ribozymes,10873382,10.1006/geno.2000.6230,"We have developed a library of hairpin ribozyme genes that can be delivered and expressed in mammalian cells with the purpose of identifying genes involved in a specific phenotype. By applying the appropriate phenotypic selection criteria in tissue culture, we can enrich for ribozymes that knock down expression of an unknown gene or genes in a particular pathway. Once specific ribozymes are selected, their target binding sequence is used to identify and clone the target gene. We have applied this technology to identify a putative tumor suppressor gene that has been activated in HF cells, a nontransformed revertant of HeLa cells. Using soft agar growth as the selection criteria for gain of transformation, we have isolated ribozymes capable of triggering anchorage-independent growth. Isolation of one of these ribozymes, Rz 568, led to the identification and cloning of the human homologue of the Drosophila gene ppan, a gene involved in DNA replication, cell proliferation, and larval development. This novel human gene, PPAN, was verified as the biologically relevant target of Rz 568 by creating five additional ""target validation"" ribozymes directed against additional sites in the PPAN mRNA. Rz 568 and all of the target validation ribozymes reduced the level of PPAN mRNA in cells and promoted anchorage-independent growth. Exogenous expression of PPAN in HeLa and A549 tumor cells reduced their ability to grow in soft agar, underscoring its role in regulating anchorage-dependent growth.

Transient expression and heat-stress-induced co-aggregation of endogenous and heterologous small heat-stress proteins in tobacco protoplasts,11069712,10.1046/j.1365-313x.2000.00887.x,"Heat-stress granules (HSG) are highly ordered, cytoplasmic chaperone complexes found in all heat-stressed plant cells. We have developed an experimental system involving expression of cytosolic class I and class II small heat-stress proteins (Hsps) of pea, Arabidopsis and tomato in tobacco protoplasts to study the structural prerequisites for the assembly of HSG or HSG-like complexes. Class I and class II small Hsps formed class-specific dodecamers of 210-280 kDa, which, upon heat stress, were incorporated into HSG complexes. Interestingly, class II dodecamers alone could form HSG-like complexes (auto-aggregation), whereas class I dodecamers could do so only in the presence of class II proteins (recruitment). By analysing C-terminal deletion forms of Hsp17 class II, we obtained evidence that the intact C-terminus is critical for the oligomerization state, for the heat-stress-induced auto-aggregation and for recruitment of class I proteins. The class-specific formation of dimers as a prerequisite for oligomerization was analysed by the yeast two-hybrid system. In the presence of the endogenous (tobacco) set of heat-stress-induced proteins, all heterologous class I and class II proteins were incorporated into HSG complexes, whose ultrastructure was different from that of complexes formed by class I and class II proteins alone. Although other, more distantly related, members of the Hsp20 family, i.e. the plastidic pea Hsp21, the Drosophila Hsp23 and the mouse Hsp25, were well expressed in tobacco protoplasts and formed homo-oligomers of 200-700 kDa, none of them could be recruited to HSG complexes.",2000,"J M Thierfelder, L Nover, S Winkelhaus, M Kirschner"
Evolution of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and CDK-activating kinases (CAKs): differential conservation of CAKs in yeast and metazoa,10889219,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a026387,"Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) function as central regulators of both the cell cycle and transcription. CDK activation depends on phosphorylation by a CDK-activating kinase (CAK). Different CAKs have been identified in budding yeast, fission yeast, and metazoans. All known CAKs belong to the extended CDK family. The sole budding yeast CAK, CAK1, and one of the two CAKs in fission yeast, csk1, have diverged considerably from other CDKs. Cell cycle regulatory components have been largely conserved in eukaryotes; however, orthologs of neither CAK1 nor csk1 have been identified in other species to date. To determine the evolutionary relationships of yeast and metazoan CAKs, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of the extended CDK family in budding yeast, fission yeast, humans, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, and the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We observed that there were 10 clades for CDK-related genes, of which seven appeared ancestral, containing both yeast and metazoan genes. The four clades that contain CDKs that regulate transcription by phosphorylating the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA Polymerase II generally have only a single orthologous gene in each species of yeast and metazoans. In contrast, the ancestral cell cycle CDK (analogous to budding yeast CDC28) gave rise to a number of genes in metazoans, as did the ancestor of budding yeast PHO85. One ancestral clade is unique in that there are fission yeast and metazoan members, but there is no budding yeast ortholog, suggesting that it was lost subsequent to evolutionary divergence. Interestingly, CAK1 and csk1 branch together with high bootstrap support values. We used both the relative apparent synapomorphy analysis (RASA) method in combination with the S-F method of sampling reduced character sets and gamma-corrected distance methods to confirm that the CAK1/csk1 association was not an artifact of long-branch attraction. This result suggests that CAK1 and csk1 are orthologs and that a central aspect of CAK regulation has been conserved in budding and fission yeast. Although there are metazoan CDK-family members for which we could not define ancestral lineage, our analysis failed to identify metazoan CAK1/csk1 orthologs, suggesting that if the CAK1/csk1 gene existed in the metazoan ancestor, it has not been conserved.",2000,"J Liu, E T Kipreos"

Laser ablation of persistent twist cells in Drosophila: muscle precursor fate is not segmentally restricted,9847241,,"In Drosophila the precursors of the adult musculature arise during embryogenesis. These precursor cells have been termed Persistent Twist Cells (PTCs), as they continue to express the transcription factor Twist after that gene ceases expression elsewhere in the mesoderm. In the larval abdomen, the PTCs are associated with peripheral nerves in stereotypic ventral, dorsal, and lateral clusters, which give rise, respectively, to the ventral, dorsal, and lateral muscle fiber groups of the adult. We tested the developmental potential of the PTCs by using a microbeam laser to ablate specific clusters in larvae. We found that the ablation of a single segmental PTC cluster does not usually result in the deletion of the corresponding adult fibers of that segment. Instead, normal or near normal numbers of adult fibers can form after the ablation. Examination of pupae following ablation showed that migrating PTCs from adjacent segments are able to invade the affected segment, replenishing the ablated cells. However, the ablation of homologous PTCs in multiple segments does result in the deletion of the corresponding adult muscle fibers. These data indicate that the PTCs in an abdominal segment can contribute to the formation of muscle fibers in adjacent abdominal segments, and thus are not inherently restricted to the formation of muscle fibers within their segment of origin.",1999,"H Keshishian, E R Farrell"
"The role of cell adhesion molecules in Drosophila heart morphogenesis: faint sausage, shotgun/DE-cadherin, and laminin A are required for discrete stages in heart development",10075841,10.1006/dbio.1998.9188,"Heart development in the Drosophila embryo starts with the specification of cardiac precursors from the dorsal edge of the mesoderm through signaling from the epidermis. Cardioblasts then become aligned in a single row of cells that migrate dorsally. After contacting their contralateral counterparts, cardioblasts undergo a cytoskeletal rearrangement and form a lumen. Its simple architecture and cellular composition makes the heart a good system to study mesodermal patterning, intergerm layer signaling, and the function of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) during morphogenesis. In this paper we focus on three adhesion molecules, faint sausage (fas), shotgun/DE-cadherin (shg/DE-Cad), and laminin A (lam A), that are essential for heart development. fas encodes an Ig-like CAM and is required for the correct number of cardioblasts to become specified, as well as proper alignment of cardioblasts. shg/DE-Cad is expressed and required at a later stage than fas; in embryos lacking this gene, cardioblasts are specified normally and become aligned, but do not form a lumen. Additionally, cardioblasts of shg mutant embryos show a redistribution of phosphotyrosine as well as a loss of Armadillo from the membrane, indicating defects in cell polarity. The shg phenotype could be phenocopied by applying EGTA or cytochalasin D, supporting the view that Ca2+-dependent adhesion and the actin cytoskeleton are instrumental for heart lumen formation. As opposed to cell-cell adhesion, cell-substrate adhesion mechanisms are not required for heart morphogenesis, but only for maintenance of the differentiated heart. Embryos lacking the lam A gene initially developed a normal heart, but showed twists and breaks of cardioblasts at late embryonic stages. We discuss our findings in light of recent results that elucidate the function of different adhesion systems in vertebrate heart development.",1999,"N P Haag, T A Haag, V Hartenstein, A C Lekven"
Requirement of Drosophila I(2)gl function for survival of the germline cells and organization of the follicle cells in a columnar epithelium during oogenesis,10410900,,"The lethal(2)giant larvae gene, or 1(2)gl, encodes a widely expressed cytoskeletal protein which acts in numerous biological processes during embryogenesis and oogenesis, including cell proliferation, and morphogenetic movements. Having identified the nucleotide change occurring in the l(2)gl(ts3) sequence, we produced by site-directed mutagenesis the identical change leading to the substitution of a serine by a phenylalanine at position 311 of p127l(2)gl and introduced the modified l(2)glF311 gene into l(2)gl flies. The transgene can fully rescue the development of l(2)gl flies raised at 22 degrees C but causes drastic effects on their development at 29 degrees C confirming the temperature sensitivity of the phenylalanine substitution at position 311. Fertility of females, albeit not of males, was strongly affected. Temperature-shift experiments and microscopic examination of ovaries showed that the mutation blocked egg chamber development at the onset of vitellogenesis (stages 8-9) with growth arrest of the oocyte, incomplete follicle cell migration over the oocyte associated with abnormal organization of the follicular epithelium, and apoptosis of the germline cells, as measured by TUNEL assays. By comparison to wildtype, we found that p127F311 is already reduced in amount at 22 degrees C and delocalized from the cytoskeletal matrix, albeit without affecting the apical localization of myosin II, a major partner of p127. At 29 degrees C, the level of p127F311 is even more reduced and the distribution of myosin-II becomes markedly altered at the apices of the follicle cells. These data indicate that during oogenesis p127 plays a critical function at the onset of vitellogenesis and regulates growth of the oocyte, follicle cell migration over the oocyte and their organization in a palisadic epithelium, as well as viability of the germline cells.",1999,"D Strand, C De Lorenzo, B M Mechler"

The choice of ethanol over a medium without ethanol was evaluated by measuring the duration of extension of the proboscis of the flies in each of the media. A slight preference for the ethanol-supplemented medium was observed in the naive flies, which was enhanced by previous exposure to ethanol. Exposure to ethanol and 4-MP, however, led to an avoidance of ethanol. There was a reduction in ADH activity on treatment of the flies with 4-MP, and signs of malaise (reduced locomotor activity, loss of balance) were observed in the flies who ingested both ethanol and inhibitor. We concluded that the preference for ethanol stems from an associative learning related to ethanol utilization.

The new laminin chain appears to be the Drosophila counterpart of both vertebrate alpha2 (also called merosin) and alpha1 chains, with a slightly higher degree of homology to alpha2, suggesting that this chain is an ancestral version of both alpha1 and alpha2 chains. During embryogenesis, the protein is associated with basement membranes of the digestive system and muscle attachment sites, and during larval stage it is found in a specific pattern in wing and eye discs. The gene is assigned to a locus called wing blister (wb), which is essential for embryonic viability. Embryonic phenotypes include twisted germbands and fewer pericardial cells, resulting in gaps in the presumptive heart and tracheal trunks, and myotubes detached from their target muscle attachment sites. Most phenotypes are in common with those observed in Drosophila laminin alpha3, 5 mutant embryos and many are in common with those observed in integrin mutations. Adult phenotypes show blisters in the wings in viable allelic combinations, similar to phenotypes observed in integrin genes.

In many cases, the connectors were mutated versions of the flanked microsatellites whose sequence pattern gradually vanished with the distance from the microsatellite center. Hence many microsatellites have hundreds rather than dozens of nucleotides in length, and their ends are diffuse. In contrast, some microsatellites containing predominantly C and/or G, did not influence their neighborhood at all. These results make us change notions about the microsatellite nature. They also indicate that the microsatellites are the dominant part of eukaryotic genomes.",1999,"J Kypr, M Matula"

Role of Notch pathway in terminal follicle cell differentiation during Drosophila oogenesis,11252183,10.1007/s004270050256,"During Drosophila oogenesis the body axes are determined by signaling between the oocyte and the somatic follicle cells that surround the egg chamber. A key event in the establishment of oocyte anterior-posterior polarity is the differential patterning of the follicle cell epithelium along the anterior-posterior axis. Both the Notch and epithelial growth factor (EGF) receptor pathways are required for this patterning. To understand how these pathways act in the process we have analyzed markers for anterior and posterior follicle cells accompanying constitutive activation of the EGF receptor, loss of Notch function, and ectopic expression of Delta. We find that a constitutively active EGF receptor can induce posterior fate in anterior but not in lateral follicle cells, showing that the EGF receptor pathway can act only on predetermined terminal cells. Furthermore, Notch function is required at both termini for appropriate expression of anterior and posterior markers, while loss of both the EGF receptor and Notch pathways mimic the Notch loss-of-function phenotype. Ectopic expression of the Notch ligand, Delta, disturbs EGF receptor dependent posterior follicle cell differentiation and anterior-posterior polarity of the oocyte. Our data are consistent with a model in which the Notch pathway is required for early follicle cell differentiation at both termini, but is then repressed at the posterior for proper determination of the posterior follicle cells by the EGF receptor pathway.",1999,"M Keller Larkin, K Holder, W M Deng, N Clegg, H Ruohola-Baker, M Tworoger"
Effects of several preservation methods on the isotopic content of Drosophila samples,10047952,10.1016/s0764-4469(99)80015-8,"Researchers working with stable isotopes are faced with the problem of preserving animal samples without altering their isotope ratios. We evaluated the effects of several preservation treatments on the isotopic content of Drosophila samples. Results show that, when there is a danger of rotting, preservation treatment is indispensable to preserve intact isotope ratios, but that not all treatments are equally appropriate. The best is freezing without liquid nitrogen. Ethanol or ethylene glycol preserve the delta 15N, but change the delta 13C. Formalin should be avoided. Storage in a NaCl solution may be a good short-term alternative to freezing for both elements. In the control males and females, the trophic isotopic shift was, respectively, +2.9 and +2.6/1000 for delta 15N, and +1.1/1000 for delta 13C (no difference between sexes). Despite a standardised rearing protocol, there were small but significant inter-tube differences, caused by microenvironmental rather than by genetic factors.",1999,"M Amlou, S Ponsard"
Functional counterparts of mammalian protein kinases PDK1 and SGK in budding yeast,10074427,10.1016/s0960-9822(99)80088-8,"Background: In animal cells, recruitment of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase by growth factor receptors generates 3-phosphoinositides, which stimulate 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1). Activated PDK1 then phosphorylates and activates downstream protein kinases, including protein kinase B (PKB)/c-Akt, p70 S6 kinase, PKC isoforms, and serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase (SGK), thereby eliciting physiological responses. Results: We found that two previously uncharacterised genes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which we term PKH1 and PKH2, encode protein kinases with catalytic domains closely resembling those of human and Drosophila PDK1. Both Pkh1 and Pkh2 were essential for cell viability. Expression of human PDK1 in otherwise inviable pkh1Delta pkh2Delta cells permitted growth. In addition, the yeast YPK1 and YKR2 genes were found to encode protein kinases each with a catalytic domain closely resembling that of SGK; both Ypk1 and Ykr2 were also essential for viability. Otherwise inviable ypk1Delta ykr2Delta cells were fully rescued by expression of rat SGK, but not mouse PKB or rat p70 S6 kinase. Purified Pkh1 activated mammalian SGK and PKBalpha in vitro by phosphorylating the same residue as PDK1. Pkh1 activated purified Ypk1 by phosphorylating the equivalent residue (Thr504) and was required for maximal Ypk1 phosphorylation in vivo. Unlike PKB, activation of Ypk1 and SGK by Pkh1 did not require phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, consistent with the absence of pleckstrin homology domains in these proteins. The phosphorylation consensus sequence for Ypk1 was similar to that for PKBalpha and SGK. Conclusions: Pkh1 and Pkh2 function similarly to PDK1, and Ypk1 and Ykr2 to SGK. As in animal cells, these two groups of yeast kinases constitute two tiers of a signalling cascade required for yeast cell growth.",1999,"J Thorner, A Casamayor, D R Alessi, T Kobayashi, P D Torrance"
"Analysis of an insect neuropeptide, Schistocerca gregaria ion transport peptide (ITP), expressed in insect cell systems",10578114,10.1002/(SICI)1520-6327(199912)42:4<245::AID-ARCH3>3.0.CO;2-W,"We have produced an active form of Schistocerca gregaria ion transport peptide (ITP) in an insect cell expression system. Transformed Drosophila Kc1 cells secreted a form of ITP into the cell culture medium that was proteolytically cleaved correctly at the amino (N)-terminus. Concentrated culture supernatant from transformed Kc1 and Hi5 cells had high biological activity when tested on isolated locust ilea. Conversely, ITP expressed by baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells was larger in size and had decreased specific activity compared to ITP produced by Kc1 cells due to incorrect cleavage of the peptide at the N-terminus in the baculovirus system. This demonstrates how processing of the secreted foreign protein (ITP) expressed under the late polyhedrin promoter is compromised in a baculovirus-infected cell. Transient transformation of Kc1 cells results in supernatants containing two forms of ITP; one form (A) co-elutes with synthetic ITP and the other form (B) has reduced electrophoretic mobility. In contrast, in stably transformed Kc1 cell supernatant, ITP is expressed in a single form, which has the same electrophoretic mobility and specific biological activity as form A produced by transiently transformed Kc1 cells.

Specific myosin heavy chain mutations suppress troponin I defects in Drosophila muscles,10085296,10.1083/jcb.144.5.989,"We show that specific mutations in the head of the thick filament molecule myosin heavy chain prevent a degenerative muscle syndrome resulting from the hdp2 mutation in the thin filament protein troponin I. One mutation deletes eight residues from the actin binding loop of myosin, while a second affects a residue at the base of this loop. Two other mutations affect amino acids near the site of nucleotide entry and exit in the motor domain. We document the degree of phenotypic rescue each suppressor permits and show that other point mutations in myosin, as well as null mutations, fail to suppress the hdp2 phenotype. We discuss mechanisms by which the hdp2 phenotypes are suppressed and conclude that the specific residues we identified in myosin are important in regulating thick and thin filament interactions. This in vivo approach to dissecting the contractile cycle defines novel molecular processes that may be difficult to uncover by biochemical and structural analysis. Our study illustrates how expression of genetic defects are dependent upon genetic background, and therefore could have implications for understanding gene interactions in human disease.",1999,"W A Kronert, S I Bernstein, A Ferrús, A Acebes"
TLR6: A novel member of an expanding toll-like receptor family,10231569,10.1016/s0378-1119(99)00098-0,"Drosophila Toll protein is shown to activate the innate immune system in adult and regulate the dorsoventral patterning in the developing embryo. Recently, five human homologs of Drosophila Toll, designated as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), have been identified and shown to play a role in the innate immune response. We report here the molecular cloning and characterization of a new member of Toll-like receptor family, Toll-like receptor 6 (TLR6). Human and murine TLR6 are type-I transmembrane receptors that contain both an extracellular leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain and a cytoplasmic Toll/IL-1 receptor (IL-1R)-like region. The amino acid sequence of human TLR6 (hTLR6) is most similar to that of hTLR1 with 69% identity. RT-PCR analysis revealed that murine TLR6 is expressed predominantly in spleen, thymus, ovary and lung. Like other TLR family members, constitutively active TLR6 activates both NF-kappaB and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). The TLR6 gene, as well as the TLR1 gene, mapped to the proximal region of murine chromosome 5 within 1.7cM of each other. These results suggest that TLR6 is a novel member of an expanding TLR family.",1999,"S Akira, N A Jenkins, D J Gilbert, T Kawai, N G Copeland, H Sanjo, O Takeuchi, K Takeda"
The subcellular localization of PBX1 and EXD proteins depends on nuclear import and export signals and is modulated by association with PREP1 and HTH,10215622,10.1101/gad.13.8.946,"Nuclear localization of the Extradenticle (EXD) and PBX1 proteins is regionally restricted during Drosophila and mammalian development. We studied the subcellular localization of EXD, PBX, and their partners Homothorax (HTH) and PREP1, in different cell contexts. HTH and PREP1 are cytoplasmic and require association with EXD/PBX for nuclear localization. EXD and PBX1 are nuclear in murine fibroblasts but not in Drosophila Schneider cells, in which they are actively exported to the cytoplasm. Coexpression of EXD/PBX with HTH/PREP1 causes nuclear localization of their heterodimers in both cell contexts. We propose that heterodimerization with HTH/PREP induces nuclear translocation of EXD and PBX1 in specific cell contexts by blocking their nuclear export.",1999,"C Kilstrup-Nielsen, F Blasi, V Zappavigna, F Mavilio, J Berthelsen"
Proteolysis of cubitus interruptus in Drosophila requires phosphorylation by protein kinase A,10477300,,"The Hedgehog signal transduction pathway is involved in diverse patterning events in many organisms. In Drosophila, Hedgehog signaling regulates transcription of target genes by modifying the activity of the DNA-binding protein Cubitus interruptus (Ci). Hedgehog signaling inhibits proteolytic cleavage of full-length Ci (Ci-155) to Ci-75, a form that represses some target genes, and also converts the full-length form to a potent transcriptional activator. Reduction of protein kinase A (PKA) activity also leads to accumulation of full-length Ci and to ectopic expression of Hedgehog target genes, prompting the hypothesis that PKA might normally promote cleavage to Ci-75 by directly phosphorylating Ci-155. Here we show that a mutant form of Ci lacking five potential PKA phosphorylation sites (Ci5m) is not detectably cleaved to Ci-75 in Drosophila embryos. Moreover, changes in PKA activity dramatically altered levels of full-length wild-type Ci in embryos and imaginal discs, but did not significantly alter full-length Ci5m levels. We corroborate these results by showing that Ci5m is more active than wild-type Ci at inducing ectopic transcription of the Hh target gene wingless in embryos and that inhibition of PKA enhances induction of wingless by wild-type Ci but not by Ci5m. We therefore propose that PKA phosphorylation of Ci is required for the proteolysis of Ci-155 to Ci-75 in vivo. We also show that the activity of Ci5m remains Hedgehog responsive if expressed at low levels, providing further evidence that the full-length form of Ci undergoes a Hedgehog-dependent activation step.",1999,"D Kalderon, M A Price"
A targeted gene silencing technique shows that Drosophila myosin VI is required for egg chamber and imaginal disc morphogenesis,10523504,,"We report that Drosophila unconventional myosin VI, encoded by Myosin heavy chain at 95F (Mhc95F), is required for both imaginal disc and egg chamber morphogenesis. During oogenesis, Mhc95F is expressed in migrating follicle cells, including the border cells, which migrate between the nurse cells to lie at the anterior of the oocyte; the columnar cells that migrate over the oocyte; the centripetal cells that migrate between the oocyte and nurse cells; and the dorsal-anterior follicle cells, which migrate to secrete the chorionic appendages. Its function during development has been studied using a targeted gene silencing technique, combining the Gal4-UAS targeted expression system and the antisense RNA technique. Antibody staining shows that the expression of myosin 95F is greatly decreased in follicle cells when antisense Mhc95F RNA is expressed. Interfering with expression of Drosophila myosin VI at various developmental stages frequently results in lethality. During metamorphosis it results in adult flies with malformed legs and wings, indicating that myosin VI is essential for imaginal disc morphogenesis. During oogenesis, abnormal follicle cell shapes and aberrant follicle cell migrations are observed when antisense Mhc95F is expressed in follicle cells during stages 9 to 10, suggesting that the Drosophila myosin VI is required for follicle cell epithelial morphogenesis.",1999,"W Deng, K Leaper, M Bownes"
Focal cortical dysplasia: a neuropathological and developmental perspective,10515163,10.1016/s0920-1211(99)00049-2,"Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) is a rare, sporadic disorder which is a recognised cause of chronic epilepsy. It is proposed to result from disordered neuronal migration and differentiation and has characteristic histological features which include disturbed cortical lamination, large abnormal neurons and the presence of large balloon cells with glassy eosinophilic cytoplasm and pleomorphic eccentric nuclei. These latter express both glial and neuronal markers indicative of abnormal neuroglial differentiation. In this paper we review the current literature on the neuropathology of FCD and discuss potential mechanisms. We focus on growth factors, signalling pathways and candidate genes with known roles in Drosophila and vertebrate brain development that could be responsible for the developmental brain changes seen in FCD. At issue are the factors that influence cell fate and differentiation and which regulate neural migration. Some of the molecular pathways, such as those involving the Notch and the Wnt pathways have particularly important roles in neuroglial differentiation in vertebrates, and these are proposed as potential candidates.",1999,"D R Cotter, M Honavar, I Everall"
A novel positive regulatory element that enhances hamster CYP2A8 gene expression mediated by xenobiotic responsive element,9927619,10.1124/mol.55.2.279,"CYP2A8 is a major form of cytochrome P-450 inducible by 3-methylcholanthrene in Syrian hamster liver. To identify DNA elements necessary for the transcriptional activation of the CYP2A8 gene, we analyzed the regulatory region of the CYP2A8 gene and conducted transient transfection experiments of CYP2A8-luciferase fusion plasmids in primary cultures of hamster hepatocytes. We analyzed up to -5 kb of the 5'-flanking region and found the region sufficient for the 3-methylcholanthrene-inducible gene expression. This region contained a consensus sequence for xenobiotic responsive element (XRE) between -2366 and -2349, which was shown to be essential for induction of the gene expression. Furthermore, we found a novel positive regulatory element for XRE-mediated gene expression (PREX) located upstream of the XRE. This element is not identified in any genes inducible by 3-methylcholanthrene so far reported. Without PREX, the XRE-mediated promoter activity was enhanced nearly 10-fold, whereas with PREX, the activity was enhanced 20-fold over the basal level. Gel mobility shift assays revealed specific binding of nuclear proteins to PREX. Mutations and deletions of PREX caused a loss of the binding and promoter-enhancing activities, respectively. Moreover, transient expression experiments showed that the enhancing activity of PREX was not observed in Drosophila Schneider's line 2 cells, which were shown to lack the PREX binding proteins.",1999,"M Tohkin, M Fukuhara, K Kurose"
Analysis of snail genes in the crustacean Parhyale hawaiensis: insight into snail gene family evolution,22466422,10.1007/s00427-012-0396-6,"The transcriptional repressor snail was first discovered in Drosophila melanogaster, where it initially plays a role in gastrulation and mesoderm formation, and later plays a role in neurogenesis. Among arthropods, this role of snail appears to be conserved in the insects Tribolium and Anopheles gambiae, but not in the chelicerates Cupiennius salei and Achaearanea tepidariorum, the myriapod Glomeris marginata, or the Branchiopod crustacean Daphnia magna. These data imply that within arthropoda, snail acquired its role in gastrulation and mesoderm formation in the insect lineage. However, crustaceans are a diverse group with several major taxa, making analysis of more crustaceans necessary to potentially understand the ancestral role of snail in Pancrustacea (crustaceans + insects) and thus in the ancestor of insects as well. To address these questions, we examined the snail family in the Malacostracan crustacean Parhyale hawaiensis. We found three snail homologs, Ph-snail1, Ph-snail2 and Ph-snail3, and one scratch homolog, Ph-scratch. Parhyale snail genes are expressed after gastrulation, during germband formation and elongation. Ph-snail1, Ph-snail2, and Ph-snail3 are expressed in distinct patterns in the neuroectoderm. Ph-snail1 is the only Parhyale snail gene expressed in the mesoderm, where its expression cycles in the mesodermal stem cells, called mesoteloblasts. The mesoteloblasts go through a series of cycles, where each cycle is composed of a migration phase and a division phase. Ph-snail1 is expressed during the migration phase, but not during the division phase. We found that as each mesoteloblast division produces one segment's worth of mesoderm, Ph-snail1 expression is linked to both the cell cycle and the segmental production of mesoderm.",2012,"Alivia L Price, Roberta L Hannibal, Ronald J Parchem, Nipam H Patel"
Algorithms to detect multiprotein modularity conserved during evolution,21968956,10.1109/TCBB.2011.125,"Detecting essential multiprotein modules that change infrequently during evolution is a challenging algorithmic task that is important for understanding the structure, function, and evolution of the biological cell. In this paper, we define a measure of modularity for interactomes and present a linear-time algorithm, Produles, for detecting multiprotein modularity conserved during evolution that improves on the running time of previous algorithms for related problems and offers desirable theoretical guarantees. We present a biologically motivated graph theoretic set of evaluation measures complementary to previous evaluation measures, demonstrate that Produles exhibits good performance by all measures, and describe certain recurrent anomalies in the performance of previous algorithms that are not detected by previous measures. Consideration of the newly defined measures and algorithm performance on these measures leads to useful insights on the nature of interactomics data and the goals of previous and current algorithms. Through randomization experiments, we demonstrate that conserved modularity is a defining characteristic of interactomes. Computational experiments on current experimentally derived interactomes for Homo sapiens and Drosophila melanogaster, combining results across algorithms, show that nearly 10 percent of current interactome proteins participate in multiprotein modules with good evidence in the protein interaction data of being conserved between human and Drosophila.",2012,"Richard M Karp, Luqman Hodgkinson"
Efficient reverse-engineering of a developmental gene regulatory network,22807664,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002589,"Understanding the complex regulatory networks underlying development and evolution of multi-cellular organisms is a major problem in biology. Computational models can be used as tools to extract the regulatory structure and dynamics of such networks from gene expression data. This approach is called reverse engineering. It has been successfully applied to many gene networks in various biological systems. However, to reconstitute the structure and non-linear dynamics of a developmental gene network in its spatial context remains a considerable challenge. Here, we address this challenge using a case study: the gap gene network involved in segment determination during early development of Drosophila melanogaster. A major problem for reverse-engineering pattern-forming networks is the significant amount of time and effort required to acquire and quantify spatial gene expression data. We have developed a simplified data processing pipeline that considerably increases the throughput of the method, but results in data of reduced accuracy compared to those previously used for gap gene network inference. We demonstrate that we can infer the correct network structure using our reduced data set, and investigate minimal data requirements for successful reverse engineering. Our results show that timing and position of expression domain boundaries are the crucial features for determining regulatory network structure from data, while it is less important to precisely measure expression levels. Based on this, we define minimal data requirements for gap gene network inference. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of reverse-engineering with much reduced experimental effort. This enables more widespread use of the method in different developmental contexts and organisms. Such systematic application of data-driven models to real-world networks has enormous potential. Only the quantitative investigation of a large number of developmental gene regulatory networks will allow us to discover whether there are rules or regularities governing development and evolution of complex multi-cellular organisms.",2012,"Karl R Wotton, Maksat Ashyraliyev, Anton Crombach, Johannes Jaeger, Damjan Cicin-Sain"

Berberine Prolongs Life Span and Stimulates Locomotor Activity of Drosophila melanogaster,26167392,10.4236/ajps.2012.327123,"Drosophila melanogaster mutants with deficient kynurenine (KYN) formation from tryptophan (TRP) have longer life span than wild type flies. Administration of alpha-methyl-TRP and 5-methyl-TRY, the inhibitors of TRP-KYN metabolism, prolonged life span in wild-type flies. Both inhibitors are not available for human use. Berberine, an isoquinoline alkaloid isolated from Berberis aristata, is known as the herb widely used in traditional Chinese and Indian medicine. Berberin is a strong inhibitor of the enzyme catalyzing TRP conversion into KYN. Considering this particular feature we investigated the effect of berberine on life- and health-span in wild-type Drosophila melanogaster. The results of our study showed that Berberine extended mean, median and maximum life span of female flies. Berberine did not affect the number of pupae of filial generation and decreased their lethality. Berberine increased locomotor activity (vertical climbing).

DLK1 as a potential target against cancer stem/progenitor cells of hepatocellular carcinoma,22238367,10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-11-0531,"Delta-like 1 homolog (DLK1; Drosophila) is a hepatic stem/progenitor cell marker in fetal livers that plays a vital role in oncogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of this study is to investigate whether DLK1 could serve as a potential therapeutic target against cancer stem/progenitor cells of HCC. DLK1(+) and DLK1(-) cells were sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and magnetic-activated cell sorting, respectively, and then were evaluated by flow cytometry. The biological behaviors of these isolated cells and those with DLK1 knockdown were assessed by growth curve, colony formation assay, spheroid colony formation, chemoresistance, and in vivo tumorigenicity. Adenovirus-mediated RNA interference was used to knockdown the endogenous DLK1. We found that DLK1(+) population was less than 10% in almost all 17 HCC cell lines examined. DLK1(+) HCC cells showed stronger ability of chemoresistance, colony formation, spheroid colony formation, and in vivo tumorigenicity compared with DLK1(-) cells. The DLK1(+) HCC cells could generate the progeny without DLK1 expression. Furthermore, DLK1 knockdown could suppress the ability of proliferation, colony formation, spheroid colony formation, and in vivo tumorigenicity of Hep3B and Huh-7 HCC cells. Our data suggested that DLK1(+) HCC cells have characteristics similar to those of cancer stem/progenitor cells.

Chemical cues influence pupation behavior of Drosophila simulans and Drosophila buzzatii in nature and in the laboratory,22737236,10.1371/journal.pone.0039393,"In the wild, larvae of several species of Drosophila develop in heterogeneous and rapidly changing environments sharing resources as food and space. In this scenario, sensory systems contribute to detect, localize and recognize congeners and heterospecifics, and provide information about the availability of food and chemical features of environments where animals live. We investigated the behavior of D. simulans and D. buzzatii larvae to chemicals emitted by conspecific and heterospecific larvae. Our goal was to understand the role of these substances in the selection of pupation sites in the two species that cohabit within decaying prickly pear fruits (Opuntia ficus-indica). In these breeding sites, larvae of D. simulans and D. buzzatii detect larvae of the other species changing their pupation site preferences. Larvae of the two species pupated in the part of the fruit containing no or few heterospecifics, and spent a longer time in/on spots marked by conspecifics rather than heterospecifics. In contrast, larvae of the two species reared in isolation from conspecifics pupated randomly over the substrate and spent a similar amount of time on spots marked by conspecifics and by heterospecifics. Our results indicate that early chemically-based experience with conspecific larvae is critical for the selection of the pupation sites in D. simulans and D. buzzatii, and that pupation site preferences of Drosophila larvae depend on species-specific chemical cues. These preferences can be modulate by the presence of larvae of the same or another species.",2012,"Francisco Del Pino, Marcial Beltramí, María Cristina Medina-Muñoz, Raúl Godoy-Herrera, Jean-Francois Ferveur"
Tandem repeat markers as novel diagnostic tools for high resolution fingerprinting of Wolbachia,22375862,10.1186/1471-2180-12-S1-S12,"Background: Strains of the endosymbiotic bacterium Wolbachia pipientis are extremely diverse both genotypically and in terms of their induced phenotypes in invertebrate hosts. Despite extensive molecular characterisation of Wolbachia diversity, little is known about the actual genomic diversity within or between closely related strains that group tightly on the basis of existing gene marker systems, including Multiple Locus Sequence Typing (MLST). There is an urgent need for higher resolution fingerprinting markers of Wolbachia for studies of population genetics, horizontal transmission and experimental evolution. Results: The genome of the wMel Wolbachia strain that infects Drosophila melanogaster contains inter- and intragenic tandem repeats that may evolve through expansion or contraction. We identified hypervariable regions in wMel, including intergenic Variable Number Tandem Repeats (VNTRs), and genes encoding ankyrin (ANK) repeat domains. We amplified these markers from 14 related Wolbachia strains belonging to supergroup A and were successful in differentiating size polymorphic alleles. Because of their tandemly repeated structure and length polymorphism, the markers can be used in a PCR-diagnostic multilocus typing approach, analogous to the Multiple Locus VNTR Analysis (MLVA) established for many other bacteria and organisms. The isolated markers are highly specific for supergroup A and not informative for other supergroups. However, in silico analysis of completed genomes from other supergroups revealed the presence of tandem repeats that are variable and could therefore be useful for typing target strains. Conclusions: Wolbachia genomes contain inter- and intragenic tandem repeats that evolve through expansion or contraction. A selection of polymorphic tandem repeats is a novel and useful PCR diagnostic extension to the existing MLST typing system of Wolbachia, as it allows rapid and inexpensive high-throughput fingerprinting of closely related strains for which polymorphic markers were previously lacking.",2012,"Markus Riegler, Megan Woolfit, Scott L O'Neill, Wolfgang J Miller, Iñaki Iturbe-Ormaetxe"
piRNA-mediated transgenerational inheritance of an acquired trait,22555593,10.1101/gr.136614.111,"The maintenance of genome integrity is an essential trait to the successful transmission of genetic information. In animal germ cells, piRNAs guide PIWI proteins to silence transposable elements (TEs) in order to maintain genome integrity. In insects, most TE silencing in the germline is achieved by secondary piRNAs that are produced by a feed-forward loop (the ping-pong cycle), which requires the piRNA-directed cleavage of two types of RNAs: mRNAs of functional euchromatic TEs and heterochromatic transcripts that contain defective TE sequences. The first cleavage that initiates such an amplification loop remains poorly understood. Taking advantage of the existence of strains that are devoid of functional copies of the LINE-like I-element, we report here that in such Drosophila ovaries, the initiation of a ping-pong cycle is exclusively achieved by secondary I-element piRNAs that are produced in the ovary and deposited in the embryonic germline. This unusual secondary piRNA biogenesis, detected in the absence of functional I-element copies, results from the processing of sense and antisense transcripts of several different defective I-element. Once acquired, for instance after ancestor aging, this capacity to produce heterochromatic-only secondary piRNAs is partially transmitted through generations via maternal piRNAs. Furthermore, such piRNAs acting as ping-pong initiators in a chromatin-independent manner confer to the progeny a high capacity to repress the I-element mobility. Our study explains, at the molecular level, the basis for epigenetic memory of maternal immunity that protects females from hybrid dysgenesis caused by transposition of paternally inherited functional I-element.",2012,"Claudia Armenise, Thomas Grentzinger, Séverine Chambeyron, Alain Pelisson, Christine Brun, Vincent Serrano, Bruno Mugat"

Here, we present a genetic screen for potential gcm/glide interactors and identify genes encoding chromatin factors of the Trithorax and of the Polycomb groups. These proteins maintain the heritable epigenetic state, among others, of HOX genes throughout development, but their regulatory role on transiently expressed genes remains elusive. Here we show that Polycomb negatively affects Gcm/Glide autoregulation, a positive feedback loop that allows timely accumulation of Gcm/Glide threshold levels. Such temporal fine-tuning of gene expression tightly controls gliogenesis. This work performed at the levels of individual cells reveals an undescribed mode of Polycomb action in the modulation of transiently expressed fate determinants and hence in the acquisition of specific cell identity in the nervous system.",2012,"Angela Giangrande, Celine Diebold, Inma González, Anna Popkova, Roberto Bernardoni, Giacomo Cavalli, Ana Busturia, Véronique Van de Bor, Bernd Schuettengruber"
In silico prediction and analysis of Caenorhabditis EF-hand containing proteins,22701514,10.1371/journal.pone.0036770,"Calcium (Ca⁺²) is a ubiquitous messenger in eukaryotes including Caenorhabditis.

Here, we have performed homology modelling of CaM-like proteins using the crystal structure of Drosophila melanogaster CaM as a template. Molecular docking was applied to explore the binding mechanism of CaM-like proteins and IQ1 motif which is a ∼25 residues and conform to the consensus sequence (I, L, V)QXXXRXXXX(R,K) to serve as a binding site for different EF hand proteins. We made an attempt to identify all the EF-hand (a helix-loop-helix structure characterized by a 12 residues loop sequence involved in metal coordination) containing proteins and their Ca⁺² binding affinity in Caenorhabditis by analysing the complete genome sequence. Docking studies revealed that F165, F169, L29, E33, F44, L57, M61, M96, M97, M108, G65, V115, F93, N104, E144 of CaM-like protein is involved in the interaction with IQ1 motif. A maximum of 170 EF-hand proteins and 39 non-EF-hand proteins with Ca⁺²/metal binding motif were identified. Diverse proteins including enzyme, transcription, translation and large number of unknown proteins have one or more putative EF-hands. Phylogenetic analysis revealed seven major classes/groups that contain some families of proteins. Various domains that we identified in the EF-hand proteins (uncharacterized) would help in elucidating their functions. It is the first report of its kind where calcium binding loop sequences of EF-hand proteins were analyzed to decipher their calcium affinities. Variation in Ca⁺²-binding affinity of EF-hand CaBP could be further used to study the behaviour of these proteins. Our analyses postulated that Ca⁺² is likely to be key player in Caenorhabditis cell signalling.",2012,"Rizwan Hasan Khan, Manish Kumar, Ejaz Ahmad, Shadab Ahmad, Muheet Alam Saifi"
Transcriptional regulation of Profilin during wound closure in Drosophila larvae,22976306,10.1242/jcs.107490,"Injury is an inevitable part of life, making wound healing essential for survival. In postembryonic skin, wound closure requires that epidermal cells recognize the presence of a gap and change their behavior to migrate across it. In Drosophila larvae, wound closure requires two signaling pathways [the Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway and the Pvr receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathway] and regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. In this and other systems, it remains unclear how the signaling pathways that initiate wound closure connect to the actin regulators that help execute wound-induced cell migrations. Here, we show that chickadee, which encodes the Drosophila Profilin, a protein important for actin filament recycling and cell migration during development, is required for the physiological process of larval epidermal wound closure. After injury, chickadee is transcriptionally upregulated in cells proximal to the wound. We found that JNK, but not Pvr, mediates the increase in chic transcription through the Jun and Fos transcription factors. Finally, we show that chic-deficient larvae fail to form a robust actin cable along the wound edge and also fail to form normal filopodial and lamellipodial extensions into the wound gap. Our results thus connect a factor that regulates actin monomer recycling to the JNK signaling pathway during wound closure. They also reveal a physiological function for an important developmental regulator of actin and begin to tease out the logic of how the wound repair response is organized.",2012,"Michael J Galko, Yan Wang, Susanne Berger, Yujane Wu, Renate Renkawitz-Pohl, Amanda R Brock, Violet C Han"
Seeing the light: photobehavior in fruit fly larvae,22222349,10.1016/j.tins.2011.11.003,"Understanding how sensory stimuli drive behavior requires a detailed understanding of the molecular and neural nature through which the stimuli are received and processed. The visual system of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster shares marked similarities to that of mammals. Although much focus has been given to the fly visual system, an even further simplified eye and brain makes the visual system of Drosophila larvae an excellent model for dissecting sensory processing and behavioral responses to light. Recent work has identified sensory and central brain neurons required for larval visual behaviors, including circadian rhythms. Here, we review the genes and neurons regulating visual processing in Drosophila larvae and discuss the implications of this work for furthering understanding of more complex visual systems.",2012,"Alex C Keene, Simon G Sprecher"
Neurofibromin mediates FAK signaling in confining synapse growth at Drosophila neuromuscular junctions,23175848,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1756-12.2012,"Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1), caused by the mutation in the NF1 gene, is characterized by multiple pathological symptoms. Importantly, ~50% of NF1 patients also suffer learning difficulty. Although downstream pathways are well studied, regulation of the NF1-encoded neurofibromin protein is less clear. Here, we focused on the pathophysiology of Drosophila NF1 mutants in synaptic growth at neuromuscular junctions. Our analysis suggests that the Drosophila neurofibromin protein NF1 is required to constrain synaptic growth and transmission. NF1 functions downstream of the Drosophila focal adhesion kinase (FAK) Fak56 and physically interacts with Fak56. The N-terminal region of NF1 mediates the interaction with Fak56 and is required for the signaling activity and presynaptic localization of NF1. In presynapses, NF1 acts via the cAMP pathway, but independent of its GAP activity, to restrain synaptic growth. Thus, presynaptic FAK signaling may be disrupted, causing abnormal synaptic growth and transmission in the NF1 genetic disorder.",2012,"Cheng-Ting Chien, Ruey-Hwa Chen, Manyu Wang, Hsiu-Hua Kao, James A Walker, Ying-Ju Cheng, Pei-I Tsai"
Effects of mTOR Inhibitors on Components of the Salvador-Warts-Hippo Pathway,24710534,10.3390/cells1040886,"The MST/Salvador-Warts-Hippo and mTOR/Akt/PI3K growth signaling pathways have been established as important modulators of cell growth, proliferation and cell survival in controlling organ size in Drosophila and mammals. Here, we sought to determine the role of the MST family of kinases, some of which are components of the Hippo pathway, and their closely related Sterile 20-like kinases (STK) as candidates for mediating cross-talk between the Hippo and mTOR pathways. Expression analysis in the HepG2 and MCF7 cell lines demonstrated common expression of MST1/2/4, MAP4K3/4/5, STK 24 (MST3), STK25, STK39, Pak1, SLK, Stradα/β and TAO2. All components of the Hippo signaling pathway are present in both cell lines except for YAP1 in MCF7 cells. mTOR inhibition via rapamycin decreases TAZ levels in HepG2 but not MCF7 cells and increases TEAD1 levels in MCF7 but not HepG2 cells, suggesting a selective role of the mTOR pathway in regulating these Hippo targets in a cell type-specific manner. Furthermore, the cellular localization of TAZ changes in response to mTORC1/2 inhibitors and Akt inhibition. These findings demonstrate the mTOR-dependent regulation of Hippo signaling at the level of the transcriptional regulators TAZ and TEAD1 and highlight the potential role for mTOR inhibitors in regulating Hippo-signaling dependent tumors.",2012,"Jonathan Chiang, Julian A Martinez-Agosto"
A mechanism for robust circadian timekeeping via stoichiometric balance,23212247,10.1038/msb.2012.62,"Circadian (∼24 h) timekeeping is essential for the lives of many organisms. To understand the biochemical mechanisms of this timekeeping, we have developed a detailed mathematical model of the mammalian circadian clock. Our model can accurately predict diverse experimental data including the phenotypes of mutations or knockdown of clock genes as well as the time courses and relative expression of clock transcripts and proteins. Using this model, we show how a universal motif of circadian timekeeping, where repressors tightly bind activators rather than directly binding to DNA, can generate oscillations when activators and repressors are in stoichiometric balance. Furthermore, we find that an additional slow negative feedback loop preserves this stoichiometric balance and maintains timekeeping with a fixed period. The role of this mechanism in generating robust rhythms is validated by analysis of a simple and general model and a previous model of the Drosophila circadian clock. We propose a double-negative feedback loop design for biological clocks whose period needs to be tightly regulated even with large changes in gene dosage.",2012,"Daniel B Forger, Jae Kyoung Kim"
The biological function of the WD40 repeat-containing protein p55/Caf1 in Drosophila,22241697,10.1002/dvdy.23730,"Background: The p55 family WD40 repeat-containing histone chaperone proteins are components of several chromatin regulatory complexes (such as PRC2, NURF and CAF-1) and interact with histone H4, yet their functional relevance in vivo is unclear. Results: Here we use Drosophila as a genetic model to dissect the function of p55/Caf1 during development. In agree with a recent report, we find that p55 is essential for Drosophila development and is required for cell proliferation and viability. However, our data further demonstrate that histone H3K27 di-/tri-methylation and PRC2-mediated gene silencing still occur normally when p55 is missing. p55 is also implicated in bridging chromatin regulatory complexes to the chromatin by binding to histone H4, but we find that a transgene of p55 whose binding pocket is disrupted could still functionally substitute the wild-type p55 for the survival. Conclusions: Our studies suggest that p55 is not crucial for PRC2-mediated gene silencing in vivo, and the vital function of p55 is probably not dependent on its interaction with histone H4.",2012,"Zhenghui Quan, Pei Wen, Rongwen Xi"
Cold tolerance and cold-induced modulation of gene expression in two Drosophila virilis group species with different distributions,22122733,10.1111/j.1365-2583.2011.01119.x,"The importance of high and low temperature tolerance in adaptation to changing environmental conditions has evoked new interest in modulations in gene expression and metabolism linked with stress tolerance. We investigated the effects of rapid cold hardening and cold acclimatization on the chill coma recovery times of two Drosophila virilis group species, Drosophila montana and D. virilis, with different distributions and utilized a candidate gene approach to trace changes in their gene expression during and after the cold treatments. The study showed that cold acclimatization clearly decreases chill coma recovery times in both species, whereas rapid cold hardening did not have a significant effect. Microarray analysis revealed several genes showing expression changes during different stages of cold response. Amongst the 219 genes studied, two genes showed rather consistent expression changes: hsr-omega, which was up-regulated in both study species during cold acclimatization, and Eip71CD, which was down-regulated in nearly all of the cold treatments. In addition, 29 genes showed expression changes that were more treatment- and/or species specific. Overall, different stages of cold response elicited changes mainly in genes involved in heat shock response, circadian rhythm and metabolism.",2012,"A Laiho, A Hoikkala, M Kankare, Laura Vesala, T S Salminen"
Evolutionary optimum for male sexual traits characterized using the multivariate Robertson-Price Identity,22615415,10.1073/pnas.1116828109,"Phenotypes tend to remain relatively constant in natural populations, suggesting a limit to trait evolution. Although stationary phenotypes suggest stabilizing selection, directional selection is more commonly reported. However, selection on phenotypes will have no evolutionary consequence if the traits do not genetically covary with fitness, a covariance known as the Robertson-Price Identity. The nature of this genetic covariance determines if phenotypes will evolve directionally or whether they reside at an evolutionary optimum. Here, we show how a set of traits can be shown to be under net stabilizing selection through an application of the multivariate Robertson-Price Identity. We characterize how a suite of male sexual displays genetically covaries with fitness in a population of Drosophila serrata. Despite strong directional sexual selection on these phenotypes directly and significant genetic variance in them, little genetic covariance was detected with overall fitness. Instead, genetic analysis of trait deviations showed substantial stabilizing selection on the genetic variance of these traits with respect to overall fitness, indicating that they reside at an evolutionary optimum. In the presence of widespread pleiotropy, stabilizing selection on focal traits will arise through the net effects of selection on other, often unmeasured, traits and will tend to be stronger on trait combinations than single traits. Such selection may be difficult to detect in phenotypic analyses if the environmental covariance between the traits and fitness obscures the underlying genetic associations. The genetic analysis of trait deviations provides a way of detecting the missing stabilizing selection inferred by recent metaanalyses.",2012,"Matthieu Delcourt, Mark W Blows, Howard D Rundle, J David Aguirre"
Comparison of cardiolipins from Drosophila strains with mutations in putative remodeling enzymes,22465155,10.1016/j.chemphyslip.2012.03.001,"Cardiolipin is a dimeric phospholipid with a characteristic acyl composition that is generated by fatty acid remodeling after de novo synthesis. Several enzymes have been proposed to participate in acyl remodeling of cardiolipin. In order to compare the effect of these enzymes, we determined the pattern of cardiolipin molecular species in Drosophila strains with specific enzyme deletions, using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry with internal standards. We established the linear range of the method for cardiolipin quantification, determined the relative signal intensities of several cardiolipin standards, and demonstrated satisfying signal-to-noise ratios in cardiolipin spectra from a single fly. Our data demonstrate changes in the cardiolipin composition during the Drosophila life cycle. Comparison of cardiolipin spectra, using vector algebra, showed that inactivation of tafazzin had a large effect on the molecular composition of cardiolipin, inactivation of calcium-independent phospholipase A(2) had a small effect, whereas inactivation of acyl-CoA:lysocardiolipin-acyltransferase and of the trifunctional enzyme did not affect the cardiolipin composition.",2012,"Steven Blais, Yang Xu, Mindong Ren, Irit Edelman-Novemsky, Michael Schlame, Fleurise Montecillo, Colin K L Phoon, Thomas A Neubert"
Daphnia HR96 is a promiscuous xenobiotic and endobiotic nuclear receptor,22466357,10.1016/j.aquatox.2012.03.005,"Daphnia pulex is the first crustacean to have its genome sequenced. The genome project provides new insight and data into how an aquatic crustacean may respond to environmental stressors, including toxicants. We cloned Daphnia pulex HR96 (DappuHR96), a nuclear receptor orthologous to the CAR/PXR/VDR group of nuclear receptors. In Drosophila melanogaster, (hormone receptor 96) HR96 responds to phenobarbital exposure and has been hypothesized as a toxicant receptor. Therefore, we set up a transactivation assay to test whether DappuHR96 is a promiscuous receptor activated by xenobiotics and endobiotics similar to the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and the pregnane X-receptor (PXR). Transactivation assays performed with a GAL4-HR96 chimera demonstrate that HR96 is a promiscuous toxicant receptor activated by a diverse set of chemicals such as pesticides, hormones, and fatty acids. Several environmental toxicants activate HR96 including estradiol, pyriproxyfen, chlorpyrifos, atrazine, and methane arsonate. We also observed repression of HR96 activity by chemicals such as triclosan, androstanol, and fluoxetine. Nearly 50% of the chemicals tested activated or inhibited HR96. Interestingly, unsaturated fatty acids were common activators or inhibitors of HR96 activity, indicating a link between diet and toxicant response. The omega-6 and omega-9 unsaturated fatty acids linoleic and oleic acid activated HR96, but the omega-3 unsaturated fatty acids alpha-linolenic acid and docosahexaenoic acid inhibited HR96, suggesting that these two distinct sets of lipids perform opposing roles in Daphnia physiology. This also provides a putative mechanism by which the ratio of dietary unsaturated fats may affect the ability of an organism to respond to a toxic insult. In summary, HR96 is a promiscuous nuclear receptor activated by numerous endo- and xenobiotics.",2012,"William S Baldwin, Gautam K Ginjupalli, Yangchun Li, Elina Karimullina"
ALS-linked SOD1 in glial cells enhances ß-N-Methylamino L-Alanine (BMAA)-induced toxicity in Drosophila,24627764,10.12688/f1000research.1-47.v1,"Environmental factors have been implicated in the etiology of a number of neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, the role of environmental agents in ALS remains poorly understood. To this end, we used transgenic fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) to explore the interaction between mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) and chemicals such as ß-N-methylamino L-alanine (BMAA), the herbicide agent paraquat, and superoxide species. We expressed ALS-linked human SOD1 (hSOD1A4V, and hSOD1G85R), hSOD1wt as well as the Drosophila native SOD1 (dSOD1) in motoneurons (MNs) or in glial cells alone and simultaneously in both types of cells. We then examined the effect of BMAA (3 mM), paraquat (20 mM), and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, 1%) on the lifespan of SOD1-expressing flies. Our data show that glial expression of mutant and wild type hSOD1s reduces the ability of flies to climb. Further, we show that while all three chemicals significantly shorten the lifespan of flies, mutant SOD1 does not have a significant additional effect on the lifespan of flies fed on paraquat, but further shortens the lifespan of flies fed on H2O2. Finally, we show that BMAA shows a dramatic cell-type specific effect with mutant SOD1. Flies with expression of mutant hSOD1 in MNs survived longer on BMAA compared to control flies. In contrast, BMAA significantly shortened the lifespan of flies expressing mutant hSOD1 in glia. Consistent with a neuronal protection role, flies expressing these mutant hSOD1s in both MNs and glia also lived longer. Hence, our studies reveal a synergistic effect of mutant SOD1 with H2O2 and novel roles for mutant hSOD1s in neurons to reduce BMAA toxicity and in glia to enhance the toxicity of BMAA in flies.",2012,"Hong Bao, Bing Zhang, Emily L Kumimoto, Rafique Islam"
Drosophila cyclin D/Cdk4 regulates mitochondrial biogenesis and aging and sensitizes animals to hypoxic stress,22293404,10.4161/cc.11.3.19062,"Drosophila cyclinD (CycD) is the single fly ortholog of the mammalian cyclin D1 and promotes both cell cycle progression and cellular growth. However, little is known about how CycD promotes cell growth. We show here that CycD/Cdk4 hyperactivity leads to increased mitochondrial biogenesis (mitobiogenesis), mitochondrial mass, NRF-1 activity (Tfam transcript levels) and metabolic activity in Drosophila, whereas loss of CycD/Cdk4 activity has the opposite effects. Surprisingly, both CycD/Cdk4 addition and loss of function increase mitochondrial superoxide production and decrease lifespan, indicating that an imbalance in mitobiogenesis may lead to oxidative stress and aging. In addition, we provide multiple lines of evidence indicating that CycD/Cdk4 activity affects the hypoxic status of cells and sensitizes animals to hypoxia. Both mitochondrial and hypoxia-related effects can be detected at the global transcriptional level. We propose that mitobiogenesis and the hypoxic stress response have an antagonistic relationship, and that CycD/Cdk4 levels regulate mitobiogenesis contemporaneous to the cell cycle, such that only when cells are sufficiently oxygenated can they proliferate.",2012,"Amalia Icreverzi, Aida Flor de la Cruz, Bruce A Edgar, Wayne A Van Voorhies"
The evolution of Dscam genes across the arthropods,22500922,10.1186/1471-2148-12-53,"Background: One way of creating phenotypic diversity is through alternative splicing of precursor mRNAs. A gene that has evolved a hypervariable form is Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule (Dscam-hv), which in Drosophila melanogaster can produce thousands of isoforms via mutually exclusive alternative splicing. The extracellular region of this protein is encoded by three variable exon clusters, each containing multiple exon variants. The protein is vital for neuronal wiring where the extreme variability at the somatic level is required for axonal guidance, and it plays a role in immunity where the variability has been hypothesised to relate to recognition of different antigens. Dscam-hv has been found across the Pancrustacea. Additionally, three paralogous non-hypervariable Dscam-like genes have also been described for D. melanogaster. Here we took a bioinformatics approach, building profile Hidden Markov Models to search across species for putative orthologs to the Dscam genes and for hypervariable alternatively spliced exons, and inferring the phylogenetic relationships among them. Our aims were to examine whether Dscam orthologs exist outside the Bilateria, whether the origin of Dscam-hv could lie outside the Pancrustacea, when the Dscam-like orthologs arose, how many alternatively spliced exons of each exon cluster were present in the most common recent ancestor, and how these clusters evolved. Results: Our results suggest that the origin of Dscam genes may lie after the split between the Cnidaria and the Bilateria and supports the hypothesis that Dscam-hv originated in the common ancestor of the Pancrustacea. Our phylogeny of Dscam gene family members shows six well-supported clades: five containing Dscam-like genes and one containing all the Dscam-hv genes, a seventh clade contains arachnid putative Dscam genes. Furthermore, the exon clusters appear to have experienced different evolutionary histories. Conclusions: Dscam genes have undergone independent duplication events in the insects and in an arachnid genome, which adds to the more well-known tandem duplications that have taken place within Dscam-hv genes. Therefore, two forms of gene expansion seem to be active within this gene family. The evolutionary history of this dynamic gene family will be further unfolded as genomes of species from more disparate groups become available.",2012,"Ignacio G Bravo, Joachim Kurtz, Sophie A O Armitage, Rebecca Y Freiburg"
Re-analysis of the larval testis data on meiotic sex chromosome inactivation revealed evidence for tissue-specific gene expression related to the drosophila X chromosome,22691264,10.1186/1741-7007-10-49,"Background: Meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI) during spermatogenesis has been proposed as one of the evolutionary driving forces behind both the under-representation of male-biased genes on, and the gene movement out of, the X chromosome in Drosophila. However, the relevance of MSCI in shaping sex chromosome evolution is controversial. Here we examine two aspects of a recent study on testis gene expression (Mikhaylova and Nurminsky, BMC Biol 2011, 9:29) that failed to support the MSCI in Drosophila. First, Mikhaylova and Nurminsky found no differences between X-linked and autosomal genes based on the transcriptional profiling of the early testis development, and thus concluded that MSCI does not occur in D. melanogaster. Second, they also analyzed expression data from several D. melanogaster tissues and concluded that under-representation on the X chromosome is not an exclusive property of testis-biased genes, but instead, a general property of tissue-specific genes. Results: By re-analyzing the Mikhaylova and Nurminsky's testis data and the expression data on several D. melanogaster tissues, we made two major findings that refuted their original claims. First, the developmental testis data has generally greater experimental error than conventional analyses, which reduced significantly the power to detect chromosomal differences in expression. Nevertheless, our re-analysis observed significantly lower expression of the X chromosome in the genomic transcriptomes of later development stages of the testis, which is consistent with the MSCI hypothesis. Second, tissue-specific genes are also in general enriched with genes more expressed in testes than in ovaries, that is testis-biased genes. By completely excluding from the analyses the testis-biased genes, which are known to be under-represented in the X, we found that all the other tissue-specific genes are randomly distributed between the X chromosome and the autosomes. Conclusions: Our findings negate the original study of Mikhaylova and Nurminsky, which concluded a lack of MSCI and generalized the pattern of paucity in the X chromosome for tissue-specific genes in Drosophila. Therefore, MSCI and other selection-based models such as sexual antagonism, dosage compensation, and meiotic-drive continue to be viable models as driving forces shaping the genomic distribution of male-related genes in Drosophila.",2012,"Yong E Zhang, Maria D Vibranovski, Timothy L Karr, Manyuan Long, Hedibert F Lopes, Claus Kemkemer"
Autocrine and paracrine unpaired signaling regulate intestinal stem cell maintenance and division,23038775,10.1242/jcs.113100,"The Janus kinase (JAK) signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway is involved in the regulation of intestinal stem cell (ISC) activity to ensure a continuous renewal of the adult Drosophila midgut.

Using newly generated upd mutants and cell-specific RNAi, we showed that Upd1 is required throughout the fly life to maintain basal turnover of the midgut epithelium by controlling ISC maintenance in an autocrine manner. A role of Upd2 and Upd3 in basal conditions is discernible only in old gut, where they contribute to increased ISC abnormal division. Finally, upon an acute stress such as oral bacterial infection, we showed that Upd3 is released from enterocytes and has an additive effect with Upd2 to promote rapid epithelial regeneration. Taken together, our results show that Upd ligands are required to maintain the midgut homeostasis under both normal and pathological states.",2012,"Yu-Chen Tsai, Mickaël Poidevin, Wan-Chi Su, Dani Osman, Yu-Ting Huang, Nicolas Buchon, Bruno Lemaitre, Sveta Chakrabarti"
The cis-regulatory code of Hox function in Drosophila,22781127,10.1038/emboj.2012.179,"Precise gene expression is a fundamental aspect of organismal function and depends on the combinatorial interplay of transcription factors (TFs) with cis-regulatory DNA elements. While much is known about TF function in general, our understanding of their cell type-specific activities is still poor. To address how widely expressed transcriptional regulators modulate downstream gene activity with high cellular specificity, we have identified binding regions for the Hox TF Deformed (Dfd) in the Drosophila genome. Our analysis of architectural features within Hox cis-regulatory response elements (HREs) shows that HRE structure is essential for cell type-specific gene expression. We also find that Dfd and Ultrabithorax (Ubx), another Hox TF specifying different morphological traits, interact with non-overlapping regions in vivo, despite their similar DNA binding preferences. While Dfd and Ubx HREs exhibit comparable design principles, their motif compositions and motif-pair associations are distinct, explaining the highly selective interaction of these Hox proteins with the regulatory environment. Thus, our results uncover the regulatory code imprinted in Hox enhancers and elucidate the mechanisms underlying functional specificity of TFs in vivo.",2012,"Jana Friedrich, Maria Polychronidou, Ingrid Lohmann, Fani Papagiannouli, Daniela Bezdan, Martin H Schaefer, Jenny Rätzer, Sebastian Sorge, Stephan Ossowski, Nati Ha, Stefan R Henz, Juliane Mundorf, Petra Kaspar"

From a more fundamental perspective, the study of intestinal chemosensation is revealing novel, non-neuronal modes of communication involving differentiated epithelial cells. It is also identifying signalling mechanisms downstream of not only canonical receptors but also nutrient transporters, thereby supporting a chemosensory role for ""transceptors"" in the intestine. This review describes known and proposed mechanisms of intestinal carbohydrate, protein and lipid sensing, best characterized in mammalian systems.

Gamma neurons mediate dopaminergic input during aversive olfactory memory formation in Drosophila,22425153,10.1016/j.cub.2012.02.014,"Mushroom body (MB)-dependent olfactory learning in Drosophila provides a powerful model to investigate memory mechanisms. MBs integrate olfactory conditioned stimulus (CS) inputs with neuromodulatory reinforcement (unconditioned stimuli, US), which for aversive learning is thought to rely on dopaminergic (DA) signaling to DopR, a D1-like dopamine receptor expressed in MBs. A wealth of evidence suggests the conclusion that parallel and independent signaling occurs downstream of DopR within two MB neuron cell types, with each supporting half of memory performance. For instance, expression of the Rutabaga (Rut) adenylyl cyclase in γ neurons is sufficient to restore normal learning to rut mutants, whereas expression of Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) in α/β neurons is sufficient to rescue NF1 mutants. DopR mutations are the only case where memory performance is fully eliminated, consistent with the hypothesis that DopR receives the US inputs for both γ and α/β lobe traces. We demonstrate, however, that DopR expression in γ neurons is sufficient to fully support short- and long-term memory. We argue that DA-mediated CS-US association is formed in γ neurons followed by communication between γ and α/β neurons to drive consolidation.",2012,"Stephanie A Izzi, Michael Cressy, Hongtao Qin, Wanhe Li, Joshua Dubnau, Jonathan S Coravos"
Integration of endocrine signals that regulate insect ecdysis,11950244,10.1006/frne.2002.0228,"The extremely large number of insects and members of allied groups alive today suggests that molting--shedding of an old cuticle--may be one of the most commonly performed behaviors on our planet. Removal of an old cuticle in insects is associated with stereotyped, species-specific patterns of behavior referred to as ecdysis. It has been recognized for decades that the initiation of ecdysis is under hormonal control, but until recently many of the key peptides that regulate ecdysis were unknown. The report in 1996 of a new ecdysis-triggering hormone (ETH) sparked an era of significant advances in our understanding of the regulation of molting. This article summarizes the current model of peptide regulation of ecdysis, a model that is based on a positive feedback loop between ETH and a brain peptide, eclosion hormone. Then the relationship of these regulatory peptides to the neural circuitry that is the ultimate driver of the behavior are described. Because insects can undergo both status quo (larval-larval) and metamorphic (larval-pupal and pupal-adult) molts, differences in ecdysis behavior at different life stages are described and potential sources of these differences are identified. Most of the work described is based on studies of ecdysis in the hawkmoth, Manduca sexta, but results from studies of ecdysis in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster are also discussed.",2002,"Karen A Mesce, Susan E Fahrbach"
Identification and characterisation of novel mammalian homologues of Drosophila polyhomeoticpermits new insights into relationships between members of the polyhomeotic family,12384788,10.1007/s00439-002-0814-3,"We have identified and characterised novel members of the mammalian polyhomeotic gene family, comprising a third human homologue, PHC3, and its mouse counterpart, Phc3. The two new genes have essentially the same genomic organisation, with 15 exons specifying proteins of 983 (PHC3) or 981 (Phc3) amino acids, with an overall sequence identity of 93%. Northern blot hybridisations have identified a single large transcript in a variety of adult mouse tissues and in situ hybridisation analyses indicate apparently ubiquitous expression during early human and mouse development. Exhaustive database screening suggests a maximum of three polyhomeotic homologues in humans and in mice and, for completeness, we have also derived the full-length coding sequence of the PHC2 gene (formerly called EDR2). The availability of full-length coding sequences for PHC2, PHC3 and Phc3 completes the profile of human and mouse polyhomeotic homologues and has enabled comprehensive comparative analyses of the human, mouse and Drosophilapolyhomeotic proteins. The mammalian paralogues are located on three different chromosomes and pairwise comparisons of their protein products typically show about 34% amino acid sequence identity, except for some highly conserved domains for which we present consensus mammalian sequences. The data indicate that the novel PHC3 and Phc3 proteins are significantly more closely related to PHC2/Phc2 than either is to PHC1/Phc1 and reveal two hitherto unknown but highly conserved N-terminal domains that are shared by the PHC2/Phc2 and PHC3/Phc3 proteins but that are poorly conserved or absent in other polyhomeotic family members.",2002,"Donna-Marie Hagan, Weiping Li, Emma Tonkin, Tom Strachan"

Genetic analysis of nicotinic signaling in worms and flies,12436418,10.1002/neu.10154,"The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor is among the most thoroughly characterized molecules in the nervous system, and its role in mediating fast cholinergic neurotransmission has been broadly conserved in both vertebrates and invertebrates. However, the accessory molecules that facilitate or regulate nicotinic signaling remain mostly unknown. One approach to identify such molecules is to use molecular genetics in a simple, experimentally accessible organism to identify genes required for nicotinic signaling and to determine the molecular identity of the mutant genes through molecular cloning. Because cellular signaling pathways are often highly conserved between different animal phyla, the information gained from studies of simple organisms has historically provided many critical insights into more complex organisms, including humans. Genetic screens essentially make no prior assumptions about the types of molecules involved in the process being studied; thus, they are well suited for identifying previously unknown components of cell signaling pathways. The sophisticated genetic tools available in organisms such as the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster have also proven extremely powerful in elucidating complex biologic pathways in the absence of prior biochemical information and for assessing a molecule's in vivo function of in the context of an intact nervous system. This review describes how genetic analysis has been used to investigate nicotinic signaling mechanisms in worms and flies, and the prospects for using these studies to gain insight into nicotinic receptor function and regulation in humans.",2002,William R Schafer
Characterization of the short neuropeptide F receptor from Drosophila melanogaster,12372405,10.1016/s0006-291x(02)02351-3,"A seven transmembrane G-protein coupled receptor has been cloned from Drosophila melanogaster. This receptor shows structural similarities to vertebrate Neuropeptide Y(2) receptors and is activated by endogenous Drosophila peptides, recently designated as short neuropeptide Fs (sNPFs). sNPFs have so far been found in neuroendocrine tissues of four other insect species and of the horseshoe crab. In locusts, they accelerate ovarian maturation, and in mosquitoes, they inhibit host-seeking behavior. Expression analysis by RT-PCR shows that the sNPF receptor (Drm-sNPF-R) is present in several tissues (brain, gut, Malpighian tubules and fat body) from Drosophila larvae as well as in ovaries of adult females. All 4 Drosophila sNPFs clearly elicited a calcium response in receptor expressing mammalian Chinese hamster ovary cells. The response is dose-dependent and appeared to be very specific. The short NPF receptor was not activated by any of the other tested arthropod peptides, not even by FMRFamide-related peptides (also ending in RFamide), indicating that the Arg residue at position 4 from the amidated C-terminus appears to be crucial for the response elicited by the sNPFs.",2002,"Tom Meeusen, Liliane Schoofs, Inge Mertens, Arnold De Loof, Roger Huybrechts"
Transcription factors underlying the development and endocrine functions of the placenta,12017545,10.1210/rp.57.1.221,"The placenta has been the subject of extensive basic research efforts in two distinct fields. The developmental biology of placenta has been studied because it is the first organ to develop during embryogenesis and because a number of different gene mutations in mice result in embryonic lethality due to placental defects. The trophoblast cell lineage is relatively simple such that only two major, terminally differentiated cell types appear: an ""invasive trophoblast"" cell subtype such as extravillous cytotrophoblast cells in humans and trophoblast giant cells in mice, and a ""transport trophoblast"" cell subtype that is a syncytium (syncytiotrophoblast) in humans and mice. These two cell types also have been the focus of endocrinologists because they are the source of major placental hormones. Understanding the transcriptional regulation of placental hormone genes has given insights into the control of specificity of gene expression. Because most placental hormones are produced by very specific trophoblast cell subtypes, the transcriptional details promise to give insights into cell-subtype specification. The fields of developmental biology and molecular endocrinology appear to be meeting on this common ground with the recent discovery of key transcription factors. Specifically, the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor Hand1 is essential for differentiation of trophoblast giant cells in mice and also regulates the promoter for the giant cell-specific hormone, placental lactogen I gene (Pl1). In contrast, formation of syncytiotrophoblast cells in mice is controlled by a distinct genetic pathway that is governed by the Gcm1 transcription factor, a homologue of the Drosophila glial cells missing gene. Human GCM I has been shown to regulate the activity of the placental-specific enhancer of the aromatase gene (CYP19), which is specifically expressed in syncytiotrophoblast. Together, these findings imply that some key transcription factors have the dual functions of controlling both critical cell fate decisions in the trophoblast cell lineage and later the transcription of cell subtype-specific genes unrelated to development.",2002,"James C Cross, Ian C Scott, Lynn Anson-Cartwright"
Targeted expression of tetanus toxin: a new tool to study the neurobiology of behavior,12000095,10.1016/s0065-2660(02)47001-0,"Over the past few decades, the explosion of molecular genetic knowledge, particularly in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, has led to the identification of a large number of genes, which, when mutated, directly or indirectly affect fly behavior. Beyond the genetic and molecular characterization of genes and their associated molecular pathways, recent advances in molecular genetics also have allowed the development of new tools dedicated more directly to the dissection of the neural bases for various behaviors. In particular, the conjunction of the development of two techniques--the enhancer-trap detection system and the targeted gene expression system, based on the yeast GAL4 transcription factor--has led to the development of the binary enhancer-trap P[GAL4] expression system, which allows the selective activation of any cloned gene in a wide variety of tissue- and cell-specific patterns. Thus, this development, in addition to allowing the anatomical characterization of neuronal circuitry, also allows, via the expression of tetanus toxin light chain (known to specifically block synaptic transmission), an investigation of the role of specific neurons in certain behaviors. Using this system of ""toxigenetics,"" several forms of behavior--from those mediated by sensory systems, such as olfaction, mechanoreception, and vision, to those mediated by higher brain function, such as learning, memory and locomotion--have been studied. These studies aim to map neuronal circuitry underlying specific behaviors and thereby unravel relevant neurophysiological mechanisms. The advantage of this approach is that it is noninvasive and permits the investigation of behavior in the free moving animal. We review a number of behavioral studies that have successfully employed this toxigenetic approach, and we hope to persuade the reader that transgenic tetanus toxin light chain is a useful and appropriate tool for the armory of neuroethologists.",2002,"Jean-René Martin, Andreas Keller, Sean T Sweeney"
Is LRIG1 a tumour suppressor gene at chromosome 3p14.3?,12234026,10.1080/028418602760169398,"The LRIG1 gene (formerly LIG-1), recently cloned by us, displays structural similarities to the Drosophila Kek I gene. Kek I encodes a cell surface protein, Kekkon-1, which inhibits epidermal growth factor receptor-mediated signalling. We localized the LRIG1 gene to chromosome band 3p14.3, a region known to be deleted in various human cancers. In the present study LRIG1 gene expression was examined in different tumour cell lines and corresponding normal tissues by real-time RT-PCR. In many tumour cell lines, LRIG1 expression appeared absent or was down regulated compared to corresponding normal tissues. The results are consistent with LRIG1 being a tumour suppressor gene in humans. However, further studies are justified to elucidate the explicit role of LRIG1 as a negative regulator of oncogenesis.",2002,"Roger Henriksson, Håkan Hedman, Jonas Nilsson, Dongsheng Guo"
The evolution of sex determination systems in dipteran insects other than Drosophila,12484524,10.1023/a:1020955507978,"The multitude of sex determination mechanisms displayed in dipteran insects has usually been described in terms of variations on a single principle in which the primary signal of the primitive pathway consists of a single allelic difference at one locus. Evolution of sex determination mechanisms is thought to have occurred by the addition of genes below the top gene of the pathway. The elucidation of the complex sex determination pathway of Drosophila melanogaster, as well as recent evidence that the basal genes of the pathway seem to be conserved across metazoan genera both in structure and, to a lesser degree, in function, points towards the possibility that sex determination pathways may have evolved from the bottom-up. Further to this is the question of whether the dominant male-determining factor, M, which is found in a number of insect species, represents part of the ancient sex determination pathway or is a later addition to the pathway. This, together with the possibility that the M factors found in numerous dipteran insect species may have a common origin, is discussed. The similarities of the sex determination pathways under the control of M and the implications in relation to the construction of genetic sexing strains for biological control are also discussed.",2002,D C A Shearman
"Telomere elongation (Tel), a new mutation in Drosophila melanogaster that produces long telomeres",11805059,,"In most eukaryotes telomeres are extended by telomerase. Drosophila melanogaster, however, lacks telomerase, and telomere-specific non-LTR retrotransposons, HeT-A and TART, transpose specifically to chromosome ends. A Drosophila strain, Gaiano, that has long telomeres has been identified. We extracted the major Gaiano chromosomes into an Oregon-R genetic background and examined the resulting stocks after 60 generations. In situ hybridization using HeT-A and TART sequences showed that, in stocks carrying either the X or the second chromosome from Gaiano, only the Gaiano-derived chromosomes display long telomeres. However, in stocks carrying the Gaiano third chromosome, all telomeres are substantially elongated, indicating that the Gaiano chromosome 3 carries a factor that increases HeT-A and TART addition to the telomeres. We show that this factor, termed Telomere elongation (Tel), is dominant and localizes as a single unit to 69 on the genetic map. The long telomeres tend to associate with each other in both polytene and mitotic cells. These associations depend on telomere length rather than the presence of Tel. Associations between metaphase chromosomes are resolved during anaphase, suggesting that they are mediated by either proteinaceous links or DNA hydrogen bonding, rather than covalent DNA-DNA bonds.",2002,"Giovanni Cenci, Maurizio Gatti, James M Mason, Giorgia M Siriaco, Larry E Champion, Chun Zhou, Abdelali Haoudi"
Sprouty2 inhibits the Ras/MAP kinase pathway by inhibiting the activation of Raf,11698404,10.1074/jbc.M108368200,"Several genetic studies in Drosophila have shown that the dSprouty (dSpry) protein inhibits the Ras/mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway induced by various activated receptor tyrosine kinase receptors, most notably those of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR). Currently, the mode of action of dSpry is unknown, and the point of inhibition remains controversial. There are at least four mammalian Spry isoforms that have been shown to co-express preferentially with FGFRs as compared with EGFRs. In this study, we investigated the effects of the various mammalian Spry isoforms on the Ras/MAP kinase pathway in cells overexpressing constitutively active FGFR1. hSpry2 was significantly more potent than mSpry1 or mSpry4 in inhibiting the Ras/MAP kinase pathway. Additional experiments indicated that full-length hSpry2 was required for its full potency. hSpry2 had no inhibitory effect on either the JNK or the p38 pathway and displayed no inhibition of FRS2 phosphorylation, Akt activation, and Ras activation. Constitutively active mutants of Ras, Raf, and Mek were employed to locate the prospective point of inhibition of hSpry2 downstream of activated Ras. Results from this study indicated that hSpry2 exerted its inhibitory effect at the level of Raf, which was verified in a Raf activation assay in an FGF signaling context.",2002,"Jormay Lim, Esther Sook Miin Wong, Permeen Yusoff, Siew Hwa Ong, Graeme R Guy, Ting Ling Lo, Hwei Fen Leong, Chee Wai Fong, Dieu-Hung Lao"
Pax3 induces cell aggregation and regulates phenotypic mesenchymal-epithelial interconversion,11861759,,"Paired box-containing transcription factors play fundamental roles in pattern formation during embryonic development of diverse organisms ranging from Drosophila to mammals. Although mutations to Pax3 and other Pax-family genes in both mice and humans result in numerous tissue-specific morphological defects, little is known about the cellular processes that Pax genes regulate. We show that extopic Pax3 expression in two distinct phenotypically mesenchymal mammalian cell lines induces the formation of multi-layered condensed cell aggregates with epithelial characteristics. For one of these lines, we showed further that Pax3-induced cell aggregation is accompanied by specific morphological changes, including a significant reduction in cell size, altered cell shape and dramatic alterations to both membrane and cytoskeleton architecture. In addition to mediating a phenotypic mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition, Pax3 also establishes the conditions in these cells for a subsequent hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF)-induced phenotypic epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Thus, our data show a novel morphogenetic activity for Pax3 which, when absent in vivo, is predicted to give rise to the observed structural defects in somites and the neural tube during embryonic development.",2002,"O'Neil Wiggan, Marc P Fadel, Paul A Hamel"

Genetic and inhibitor studies indicate a function for Nicastrin in the gamma-secretase step of Notch processing, similar to Presenilin. Further, Nicastrin is genetically required for signaling from membrane-anchored activated Notch. In the absence of Nicastrin, Presenilin is destabilized and mature C-terminal subunits are absent. Nicastrin might recruit gamma-secretase substrates into the proteolytic complex as a prerequisite for Presenilin maturation and active complex assembly.",2002,"Mark E Fortini, Yue Hu, Yihong Ye"
"Molecular identification and localization of Trp homologues, putative calcium channels, in pregnant human uterus",12356946,10.1093/molehr/8.10.946,"The mechanisms underlying the switch from uterine quiescence to contractile activity in labour are not clearly understood. Increasing evidence suggests that pathways of myometrial calcium homeostasis, including store-operated calcium entry (SOCE), may play an important role. The molecular basis of the membrane-associated calcium channels contributing to SOCE in pregnant human myometrium is not known, but they are likely to be hetero- or homo-oligomeric assemblies of transient receptor potential channel (TrpC) proteins, encoded by the mammalian homologues of Drosophila Trp genes. This study has therefore determined Trp gene expression and also TrpC protein expression and localization in term pregnant human myometrial tissue and primary cultured human myometrial smooth muscle (HMSM) cells.

A Drosophila dopamine 2-like receptor: Molecular characterization and identification of multiple alternatively spliced variants,12391323,10.1073/pnas.202498299,"Dopamine is an important neurotransmitter in the central nervous system of both Drosophila and mammals. Despite the evolutionary distance, functional parallels exist between the fly and mammalian dopaminergic systems, with both playing roles in modulating locomotor activity, sexual function, and the response to drugs of abuse. In mammals, dopamine exerts its effects through either dopamine 1-like (D1-like) or D2-like G protein-coupled receptors. Although pharmacologic data suggest the presence of both receptor subtypes in insects, only cDNAs encoding D1-like proteins have been isolated previously. Here we report the cloning and characterization of a newly discovered Drosophila dopamine receptor. Sequence analysis reveals that this putative protein shares highest homology with known mammalian dopamine 2-like receptors. Eight isoforms of the Drosophila D2-like receptor (DD2R) transcript have been identified, each the result of alternative splicing. The encoded heptahelical receptors range in size from 461 to 606 aa, with variability in the length and sequence of the third intracellular loop. Pharmacologic assessment of three DD2R isoforms, DD2R-606, DD2R-506, and DD2R-461, revealed that among the endogenous biogenic amines, dopamine is most potent at each receptor. As established for mammalian D2-like receptors, stimulation of the Drosophila homologs with dopamine triggers pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi/o-mediated signaling. The D2-like receptor agonist, bromocriptine, has nanomolar potency at DD2R-606, -506, and -461, whereas multiple D2-like receptor antagonists (as established with mammalian receptors) have markedly reduced if any affinity when assessed at the fly receptor isoforms. The isolation of cDNAs encoding Drosophila D2-like receptors extends the range of apparent parallels between the dopaminergic system in flies and mammals. Pharmacologic and genetic manipulation of the DD2Rs will provide the opportunity to better define the physiologic role of these proteins in vivo and further explore the utility of invertebrates as a model system for understanding dopaminergic function in higher organisms.",2002,"Martin Beinborn, Alan S Kopin, Mark G Hearn, Yong Ren, Isabelle Reveillaud, Edward W McBride"
spalt-induced specification of distinct dorsal and ventral domains is required for Drosophila tracheal patterning,12376110,,"Morphogenesis of the Drosophila tracheal system relies on different signalling pathways that have distinct roles in specifying both the migration of the tracheal cells and the particular morphological features of the primary branches. The current view is that the tracheal cells are initially specified as an equivalent group of cells whose diversification depends on signals from the surrounding cells. In this work, we show that the tracheal primordia are already specified as distinct dorsal and ventral cell populations. This subdivision depends on the activity of the spalt (sal) gene and occurs prior to the activity of the signalling pathways that dictate the development of the primary branches. Finally, we show that the specification of these two distinct cell populations, which are not defined by cell lineage, are critical for proper tracheal patterning. These results indicate that tracheal patterning depends not only on signalling from surrounding cells but also in the different response of the tracheal cells depending on their allocation to the dorsal or ventral domains.",2002,"Xavier Franch-Marro, Jordi Casanova"

Short Stop provides an essential link between F-actin and microtubules during axon extension,11874915,,"Coordination of F-actin and microtubule dynamics is important for cellular motility and morphogenesis, but little is known about underlying mechanisms. short stop (shot) encodes an evolutionarily conserved, neuronally expressed family of rod-like proteins required for sensory and motor axon extension in Drosophila melanogaster. We identify Shot isoforms that contain N-terminal F-actin and C-terminal microtubule-binding domains, and that crosslink F-actin and microtubules in cultured cells. The F-actin- and microtubule-binding domains of Shot are required in the same molecule for axon extension, though the length of the connecting rod domain can be dramatically reduced without affecting activity. Shot therefore functions as a cytoskeletal crosslinker in axon extension, rather than mediating independent interactions with F-actin and microtubules. A Ca(2+)-binding motif located adjacent to the microtubule-binding domain is also required for axon extension, suggesting that intracellular Ca(2+) release may regulate Shot activity. These results suggest that Shot coordinates regulated interactions between F-actin and microtubules that are crucial for neuronal morphogenesis.",2002,"Seungbok Lee, Peter A Kolodziej"
Evolution of the A+T-rich region of mitochondrial DNA in the melanogaster species subgroup of Drosophila,12399931,10.1007/s00239-002-2353-x,"We determined the nucleotide sequences of two regions in the A+T-rich region of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in the siI and siII types of D. simulans, the maII type of D. mauritiana, and D. sechellia.

The type I and type II elements and the T-stretches were detected in all eight of the mtDNA types compared, indicating that the three elements are essential in the A+T-rich region of this species subgroup. The alignment revealed several short repetitive sequences and relatively large deletions in the central portions of the region. In the highly conserved sequence elements in the type II elements, the substitution rates were not uniform among lineages and acceleration in the substitution rate might have been due to loss of functional constraint in the stem-loop-forming sequences predicted in the type II elements. Patterns of nucleotide substitutions observed in the A+T-rich region were further compared with those in the coding regions and in the intergenic regions of mtDNA. Substitutions between A and T were particularly repressed in the highly conserved sequence elements and in the intergenic regions compared with those in the A+T-rich region excluding the highly conserved sequence elements and in the fourfold degenerate sites in the coding regions.

Notch and Wingless modulate the response of cells to Hedgehog signalling in the Drosophila wing,12142023,10.1006/dbio.2002.0720,"During Drosophila wing development, Hedgehog (Hh) signalling is required to pattern the imaginal disc epithelium along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis. The Notch (N) and Wingless (Wg) signalling pathways organise the dorsal-ventral (DV) axis, including patterning along the presumptive wing margin. Here, we describe a functional hierarchy of these signalling pathways that highlights the importance of competing influences of Hh, N, and Wg in establishing gene expression domains. Investigation of the modulation of Hh target gene expression along the DV axis of the wing disc revealed that collier/knot (col/kn), patched (ptc), and decapentaplegic (dpp) are repressed at the DV boundary by N signalling. Attenuation of Hh signalling activity caused by loss of fused function results in a striking down-regulation of col, ptc, and engrailed (en) symmetrically about the DV boundary. We show that this down-regulation depends on activity of the canonical Wg signalling pathway. We propose that modulation of the response of cells to Hh along the future proximodistal (PD) axis is necessary for generation of the correctly patterned three-dimensional adult wing. Our findings suggest a paradigm of repression of the Hh response by N and/or Wnt signalling that may be applicable to signal integration in vertebrate appendages.",2002,"Bruno Glise, D Leanne Jones, Philip W Ingham"
Gliogenesis in Drosophila: genome-wide analysis of downstream genes of glial cells missing in the embryonic nervous system,12091301,,"In Drosophila, the glial cells missing (gcm) gene encodes a transcription factor that controls the determination of glial versus neuronal fate. In gcm mutants, presumptive glial cells are transformed into neurons and, conversely, when gcm is ectopically misexpressed, presumptive neurons become glia. Although gcm is thought to initiate glial cell development through its action on downstream genes that execute the glial differentiation program, little is known about the identity of these genes. To identify gcm downstream genes in a comprehensive manner, we used genome-wide oligonucleotide arrays to analyze differential gene expression in wild-type embryos versus embryos in which gcm is misexpressed throughout the neuroectoderm. Transcripts were analyzed at two defined temporal windows during embryogenesis. During the first period of initial gcm action on determination of glial cell precursors, over 400 genes were differentially regulated. Among these are numerous genes that encode other transcription factors, which underscores the master regulatory role of gcm in gliogenesis. During a second later period, when glial cells had already differentiated, over 1200 genes were differentially regulated. Most of these genes, including many genes for chromatin remodeling factors and cell cycle regulators, were not differentially expressed at the early stage, indicating that the genetic control of glial fate determination is largely different from that involved in maintenance of differentiated cells. At both stages, glial-specific genes were upregulated and neuron-specific genes were downregulated, supporting a model whereby gcm promotes glial development by activating glial genes, while simultaneously repressing neuronal genes. In addition, at both stages, numerous genes that were not previously known to be involved in glial development were differentially regulated and, thus, identified as potential new downstream targets of gcm. For a subset of the differentially regulated genes, tissue-specific in vivo expression data were obtained that confirmed the transcript profiling results. This first genome-wide analysis of gene expression events downstream of a key developmental transcription factor presents a novel level of insight into the repertoire of genes that initiate and maintain cell fate choices in CNS development.",2002,"Boris Egger, Tanja Radimerski, Thomas Loop, Lars Kammermeier, Ulrich Certa, Ronny Leemans, Heinrich Reichert, Yun Fan, Martin C Strahm"
Zebrafish trilobite identifies new roles for Strabismus in gastrulation and neuronal movements,12105418,10.1038/ncb828,"Embryonic morphogenesis is driven by a suite of cell behaviours, including coordinated shape changes, cellular rearrangements and individual cell migrations, whose molecular determinants are largely unknown. In the zebrafish, Dani rerio, trilobite mutant embryos have defects in gastrulation movements and posterior migration of hindbrain neurons. Here, we have used positional cloning to demonstrate that trilobite mutations disrupt the transmembrane protein Strabismus (Stbm)/Van Gogh (Vang), previously associated with planar cell polarity (PCP) in Drosophila melanogaster, and PCP and canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signalling in vertebrates. Our genetic and molecular analyses argue that during gastrulation, trilobite interacts with the PCP pathway without affecting canonical Wnt signalling. Furthermore, trilobite may regulate neuronal migration independently of PCP molecules. We show that trilobite mediates polarization of distinct movement behaviours. During gastrulation convergence and extension movements, trilobite regulates mediolateral cell polarity underlying effective intercalation and directed dorsal migration at increasing velocities. In the hindbrain, trilobite controls effective migration of branchiomotor neurons towards posterior rhombomeres. Mosaic analyses show trilobite functions cell-autonomously and non-autonomously in gastrulae and the hindbrain.

The Drosophila tweety family: molecular candidates for large-conductance Ca2+-activated Cl- channels,16219661,10.1113/expphysiol.2005.031773,"Calcium-activated chloride currents (I(Cl(Ca))) can be recorded in almost all cells, but the molecular identity of the channels underlying this Cl- conductance is still incompletely understood. Here, I report that tweety, a gene located in Drosophila flightless, possesses five or six transmembrane segments, and that a human homologue of tweety (hTTYH3) is a novel large-conductance Ca2+-activated Cl- channel, while the related gene, hTTYH1, is a swelling-activated Cl- current. hTTYH3 is expressed in excitable tissues, including the heart, brain and skeletal muscle, whereas hTTYH1 is expressed mainly in the brain. Expression of hTTYH3 in CHO cells generated a unique Cl- current activated by an increase in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration. The hTTYH3-induced Cl- current had a linear current-voltage (I-V) relationship, a large single-channel conductance (260 pS) and the anion permeability sequence I- > Br- > Cl-. Like native Ca2+-activated Cl- channels, the hTTYH3 channel showed complex gating kinetics and voltage-dependent inactivation, and was dependent on micromolar intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Expression in CHO cells of an hTTYH1 splice variant that lacks the C-terminal glutamate-rich domain of hTTYH1 (hTTYH1sv) generated a swelling-activated Cl- current. I conclude that investigation of the tweety family will provide important information about large-conductance Cl- channel molecules.",2006,Makoto Suzuki
Drosophila nuclear receptor E75 is a thiolate hemoprotein,16893174,10.1021/bi060537a,"Drosophila E75 is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily. These eukaryotic transcription factors are involved in almost all physiological processes. They regulate transcription in response to binding of rigid hydrophobic hormone ligands. As it is the case for many nuclear receptors, the E75 hormone ligand was originally unknown. Recently, however, it was shown that the ligand binding domain (LBD) of E75 contains a tightly bound heme prosthetic group and is gas responsive. Here we have used site-directed mutagenesis along with UV-visible and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopies to characterize and assign the heme iron axial ligands in E75. The F370Y mutation and addition of hemin to the growth medium during expression of the protein in Escherichia coli were necessary to produce good yields of heme-enriched E75 LBD. EPR studies revealed the presence of several species containing a strongly iron bound thiolate. The involvement of cysteines 396 and 468 in heme binding was subsequently shown by single and double mutations. Using a similar approach, we have also established that the sixth iron ligand of a well-defined coordination conformation, which accounts for approximately half of the total species, is histidine 574. The other iron coordination pairs are discussed. We conclude that E75 is a new example of a thiolate hemoprotein and that it may be involved in hormone synthesis regulation.",2006,"Eve de Rosny, Jacques Gaillard, Arjan de Groot, Franck Borel, Eva Pebay-Peyroula, Celine Jullian-Binard, Juan Carlos Fontecilla-Camps, Hélène M Jouve"
Spectrin functions upstream of ankyrin in a spectrin cytoskeleton assembly pathway,17060500,10.1083/jcb.200602095,"Prevailing models place spectrin downstream of ankyrin in a pathway of assembly and function in polarized cells. We used a transgene rescue strategy in Drosophila melanogaster to test contributions of four specific functional sites in beta spectrin to its assembly and function. (1) Removal of the pleckstrin homology domain blocked polarized spectrin assembly in midgut epithelial cells and was usually lethal. (2) A point mutation in the tetramer formation site, modeled after a hereditary elliptocytosis mutation in human erythrocyte spectrin, had no detectable effect on function. (3) Replacement of repetitive segments 4-11 of beta spectrin with repeats 2-9 of alpha spectrin abolished function but did not prevent polarized assembly. (4) Removal of the putative ankyrin-binding site had an unexpectedly mild phenotype with no detectable effect on spectrin targeting to the plasma membrane.

Acetylcholinesterase genes within the Diptera: takeover and loss in true flies,17002944,10.1098/rspb.2006.3621,"It has recently been reported that the synaptic acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in mosquitoes is encoded by the ace-1 gene, distinct and divergent from the ace-2 gene, which performs this function in Drosophila. This is an unprecedented situation within the Diptera order because both ace genes derive from an old duplication and are present in most insects and arthropods. Nevertheless, Drosophila possesses only the ace-2 gene. Thus, a secondary loss occurred during the evolution of Diptera, implying a vital function switch from one gene (ace-1) to the other (ace-2). We sampled 78 species, representing 50 families (27% of the Dipteran families) spread over all major subdivisions of the Diptera, and looked for ace-1 and ace-2 by systematic PCR screening to determine which taxonomic groups within the Diptera have this gene change. We show that this loss probably extends to all true flies (or Cyclorrhapha), a large monophyletic group of the Diptera. We also show that ace-2 plays a non-detectable role in the synaptic AChE in a lower Diptera species, suggesting that it has non-synaptic functions. A relative molecular evolution rate test showed that the intensity of purifying selection on ace-2 sequences is constant across the Diptera, irrespective of the presence or absence of ace-1, confirming the evolutionary importance of non-synaptic functions for this gene. We discuss the evolutionary scenarios for the takeover of ace-2 and the loss of ace-1, taking into account our limited knowledge of non-synaptic functions of ace genes and some specific adaptations of true flies.",2006,"Georges Lutfalla, Claire Berticat, Arnaud Berthomieu, Mylène Weill, Haoues Alout, Emmanuel J P Douzery, Michel Martinez, Elise Huchard, Michel Raymond"
The role of Sp1 and Sp3 in the constitutive DPYD gene expression,16806531,10.1016/j.bbaexp.2006.05.001,"Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), the initial and rate-limiting enzyme in the 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) catabolic pathway, has been implicated as one of the factors determining the efficacy and toxicity of the anticancer agent 5-FU. Studies have attributed variation in DPD activity partially to alterations at the transcriptional level of DPYD gene. We investigated the transcription factors implicated in the constitutive expression of DPYD by utilizing a 174-bp fragment of the DPYD promoter region in which three consensus Sp protein binding sites (SpA, SpB and SpC) were predicted. The binding of Sp1 and Sp3 transcription factors to this region was detected by electrophoretic mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. By ectopically expressing human Sp1 and Sp3 in Sp-deficient Drosophila S2 cells, we demonstrated that Sp1 is a strong activator, while Sp3 by its own is a weak activator of the DPYD promoter. Moreover, Sp3 may serve as a competitor of Sp1, thus decreasing the Sp1 induced promoter activity. SpA, SpB and SpC sites are all Sp1 inducible. In the full activation of the DPYD promoter in human cell lines, the SpB site is essential; the SpC site works cooperatively with SpB, while SpA has minor promoter activity. These studies provide further insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the heterogeneity of DPD activity, and may facilitate the efficacy and safety of 5-FU-based chemotherapy.",2006,"Robert B Diasio, James R Davie, Lin Li, Jeanne Fourie, Vincenzo Guarcello, Xue Zhang"
Helitron Transposons on the Sex Chromosomes of the Platyfish Xiphophorus maculatus and Their Evolution in Animal Genomes,18248245,10.1089/zeb.2006.3.39,"The sex-determining region of the sex chromosomes of the platyfish Xiphophorus maculatus contains several copies of a recently described class of DNA transposons called Helitrons, which probably transpose through a mechanism involving rolling circle replication. The unique open reading frame of platyfish elements encodes a 2816 amino-acid protein with helicase and replication initiator (Rep) domains, which are hallmarks of Helitrons. Like previously described elements from zebrafish but unlike sequences from plants, insects and nematodes, platyfish Helitrons also encode a C-terminal apurinic-apyrimidinic-like endonuclease probably captured from a non-long-terminal- repeat retrotransposon. A cysteine protease domain related to the Drosophila ovarian tumor (OTU) protein was identified in the N-terminal part of the platyfish sequence. Putative endonuclease and protease have been acquired sequentially at least 600 million years ago and maintained functional in elements from sea urchin, lancelet and teleost fish, implying an important role for these domains in the transposition mechanism. Apparently intact Helitron elements are transcribed in Xiphophorus, and insertion polymorphism was observed between related fishes in different poeciliids. These observations suggest that Helitron transposons are still active in the genome of platyfish and related species, where they might play a role in the evolution of sex chromosomes and other genomic regions.",2006,"Cornelia Schmidt, Gerd P Bienert, Alexander Froschauer, Jean-Nicolas Volff, Christina Schultheis, Marina Wenning, Agnès Dettai, Qingchun Zhou"
A multispecies comparison of the metazoan 3'-processing downstream elements and the CstF-64 RNA recognition motif,16542450,10.1186/1471-2164-7-55,"Background: The Cleavage Stimulation Factor (CstF) is a required protein complex for eukaryotic mRNA 3'-processing. CstF interacts with 3'-processing downstream elements (DSEs) through its 64-kDa subunit, CstF-64; however, the exact nature of this interaction has remained unclear. We used EST-to-genome alignments to identify and extract large sets of putative 3'-processing sites for mRNA from ten metazoan species, including Homo sapiens, Canis familiaris, Rattus norvegicus, Mus musculus, Gallus gallus, Danio rerio, Takifugu rubripes, Drosophila melanogaster, Anopheles gambiae, and Caenorhabditis elegans. In order to further delineate the details of the mRNA-protein interaction, we obtained and multiply aligned CstF-64 protein sequences from the same species. Results: We characterized the sequence content and specific positioning of putative DSEs across the range of organisms studied. Our analysis characterized the downstream element (DSE) as two distinct parts - a proximal UG-rich element and a distal U-rich element. We find that while the U-rich element is largely conserved in all of the organisms studied, the UG-rich element is not. Multiple alignment of the CstF-64 RNA recognition motif revealed that, while it is highly conserved throughout metazoans, we can identify amino acid changes that correlate with observed variation in the sequence content and positioning of the DSEs. Conclusion: Our analysis confirms the early reports of separate U- and UG-rich DSEs. The correlated variations in protein sequence and mRNA binding sequences provide novel insights into the interactions between the precursor mRNA and the 3'-processing machinery.",2006,"Jesse Salisbury, Joel H Graber, Keith W Hutchison"
A genomewide screen for suppressors of par-2 uncovers potential regulators of PAR protein-dependent cell polarity in Caenorhabditis elegans,16816419,10.1534/genetics.106.060517,"The PAR proteins play an essential role in establishing and maintaining cell polarity. While their function is conserved across species, little is known about their regulators and effectors. Here we report the identification of 13 potential components of the C. elegans PAR polarity pathway, identified in an RNAi-based, systematic screen to find suppressors of par-2(it5ts) lethality. Most of these genes are conserved in other species. Phenotypic analysis of double-mutant animals revealed that some of the suppressors can suppress lethality associated with the strong loss-of-function allele par-2(lw32), indicating that they might impinge on the PAR pathway independently of the PAR-2 protein. One of these is the gene nos-3, which encodes a homolog of Drosophila Nanos. We find that nos-3 suppresses most of the phenotypes associated with loss of par-2 function, including early cell division defects and maternal-effect sterility. Strikingly, while PAR-1 activity was essential in nos-3; par-2 double mutants, its asymmetric localization at the posterior cortex was not restored, suggesting that the function of PAR-1 is independent of its cortical localization. Taken together, our results identify conserved components that regulate PAR protein function and also suggest a role for NOS-3 in PAR protein-dependent cell polarity.",2006,"Thomas Marty, Anne Pacquelet, Jean-Claude Labbé, Monica Gotta"
Towards understanding CRUMBS function in retinal dystrophies,16987889,10.1093/hmg/ddl195,"Mutations in the Crumbs homologue 1 (CRB1) gene cause autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (arRP) and autosomal Leber congenital amaurosis (arLCA).

Human CRB1 and its two paralogues, CRB2 and CRB3, are highly conserved throughout the animal kingdom. Both in Drosophila and in vertebrates, the short intracellular domain of Crb/CRB organizes an evolutionary conserved protein scaffold. Several lines of evidence, obtained both in Drosophila and in mouse, show that loss-of-function of crb/CRB1 or some of its intracellular interactors lead to morphological defects and light-induced degeneration of photoreceptor cells, features comparable to those observed in patients lacking CRB1 function.

In this study, we used mating trials to compare the mating success of male Drosophila melanogaster adapted for 10 years to two different temperatures, 18 and 25 degrees C. In competition for female partners, males had significantly higher mating success at their adapted temperature compared with males adapted to a different temperature.

EcRB1 is normally induced with a form of USP that is missing its DNA-binding domain (DBD), although potentiation by juvenile hormone (JH) III is reduced. The EcRA and B2 isoforms, however, display almost no response to ecdysteroids with the DBD(-) USP.

"Dysfusion transcriptional control of Drosophila tracheal migration, adhesion, and fusion",16914738,10.1128/MCB.00284-06,"The Drosophila dysfusion basic-helix-loop-helix-PAS transcription factor gene is expressed in specialized fusion cells that reside at the tips of migrating tracheal branches. dysfusion mutants were isolated, and genetic analysis of live embryos revealed that mutant tracheal branches migrate to close proximity but fail to recognize and adhere to each other. Misexpression of dysfusion throughout the trachea further indicated that dysfusion has the ability to both inhibit cell migration and promote ectopic tracheal fusion. Nineteen genes whose expression either increases or decreases in fusion cells during development were analyzed in dysfusion mutant embryos. dysfusion upregulates the levels of four genes, including the shotgun cell adhesion protein gene and the zona pellucida family transmembrane protein gene, CG13196. Misexpression experiments with CG13196 result in ectopic tracheal fusion events, suggesting that it also encodes a cell adhesion protein. Another target gene of dysfusion is members only, which inhibits protein nuclear export and influences tracheal fusion. dysfusion also indirectly downregulates protein levels of Trachealess, an important regulator of tracheal development. These results indicate that fusion cells undergo dynamic changes in gene expression as they switch from migratory to fusion modes and that dysfusion regulates a discrete, but important, set of these genes.",2006,"Stephen T Crews, Lan Jiang"
The function of a Drosophila glypican does not depend entirely on heparan sulfate modification,17055473,10.1016/j.ydbio.2006.09.011,"Division abnormally delayed (Dally) is one of two glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked heparan sulfate proteoglycans in Drosophila. Numerous studies have shown that it influences Decapentaplegic (Dpp) and Wingless signaling. It has been generally assumed that Dally affects signaling by directly interacting with these growth factors, primarily through its heparan sulfate (HS) chains. To understand the functional contributions of HS chains and protein core we have (1) assessed the growth factor binding properties of purified Dally using surface plasmon resonance, (2) generated a form of Dally that is not HS modified and evaluated its signaling capacity in vivo. Purified Dally binds directly to FGF2, FGF10, and the functional Dpp homolog BMP4. FGF binding is abolished by preincubation with HS, but BMP4 association is partially HS-resistant, suggesting the Dally protein core contributes to binding. Cell binding and co-immunoprecipitation studies suggest that non-HS-modified Dally retains some ability to bind Dpp or BMP4. Expression of HS-deficient Dally in vivo showed it does not promote signaling as well as wild-type Dally, yet it can rescue several dally mutant phenotypes. These data reveal that heparan sulfate modification of Dally is not required for all in vivo activities and that significant functional capacity resides in the protein core.",2006,"William D Staatz, Bethany Fox, Scott B Selleck, Daniel M Lercher, Catherine A Kirkpatrick, Sarah M Knox"
Dynamics of the SPRY domain-containing SOCS box protein 2: flexibility of key functional loops,17088318,10.1110/ps.062477806,"The SPRY domain was identified originally as a sequence repeat in the dual-specificity kinase splA and ryanodine receptors and subsequently found in many other distinct proteins, including more than 70 encoded in the human genome. It is a subdomain of the B30.2/SPRY domain and is believed to function as a protein-protein interaction module. Three-dimensional structures of several B30.2/SPRY domain-containing proteins have been reported recently: murine SSB-2 in solution by NMR spectroscopy, a Drosophila SSB (GUSTAVUS), and human PRYSPRY protein by X-ray crystallography. The three structures share a core of two antiparallel beta-sheets for the B30.2/SPRY domain but show differences located mainly at one end of the beta-sandwich. Analysis of SSB-2 residues required for interactions with its intracellular ligands has provided insights into B30.2/SPRY binding specificity and identified loop residues critical for the function of this domain. We have investigated the backbone dynamics of SSB-2 by means of Modelfree analysis of its backbone (15)N relaxation parameters and carried out coarse-grained dynamics simulation of B30.2/SPRY domain-containing proteins using normal mode analysis. Translational self-diffusion coefficients of SSB-2 measured using pulsed field gradient NMR were used to confirm the monomeric state of SSB-2 in solution. These results, together with previously reported amide exchange data, highlight the underlying flexibility of the loop regions of B30.2/SPRY domain-containing proteins that have been shown to be important for protein-protein interactions.

We examined the onset of expression of the rhodopsin genes to determine the latest time point by which photoreceptor subtype commitment must have occurred. We found that the onset of rhodopsin expression in all photoreceptors of the compound eye occurs during a narrow window from 79% to 84% of pupal development (approximately 8 h), pupal stages P12-P14. Rhodopsin 1 has the earliest onset, followed by Rhodopsins 3, 4, and 5 at approximately the same time, and finally Rhodopsin 6.

Inhibition of viruses by RNA interference,16732482,10.1007/s11262-005-6914-0,"RNA-mediated interference (RNAi) is a recently discovered process by which dsRNA is able to silence specific gene functions. Although initially described in plants, nematodes and Drosophila, the process is currently considered to be an evolutionarily conserved process that is present in the entire eukaryotic kingdom in which its original function was as a defense mechanism against viruses and foreign nucleic acids. Similarly to the silencing of genes by RNAi, viral functions can be also silenced by the same mechanism, through the introduction of specific dsRNA molecules into cells, where they are targeted to essential genes or directly to the viral genome in case RNA viruses, thus arresting viral replication. Since the pioneering work of Elbashir and coworkers, who identified RNAi activity in mammalian cells, many publications have described the inhibition of viruses belonging to most if not all viral families, by targeting and silencing diverse viral genes as well as cell genes that are essential for virus replication.

Surprisingly, Hid-mediated apoptosis requires a broader range of caspases than apoptosis initiated by loss of the caspase inhibitor DIAP1, suggesting that Hid causes apoptosis not only by antagonizing DIAP1 but also by activating DIAP1-independent caspase cascades. While Hid killing requires Strica, Decay, Dronc/Dark and drICE, apoptosis triggered by DIAP1 depletion merely relied upon Dronc/Dark and drICE. Furthermore, we found that overexpression of DIAP2 can rescue diap1-RNAi-mediated apoptosis, suggesting that DIAP2 regulates caspases directly. Consistently, we show that DIAP2 binds active drICE.

Previously, two PcG mutants, polyhomeotic and Enhancer of zeste, were shown to exhibit mitotic segregation defects in embryos, and condensation defects in imaginal discs, respectively. We show that polyhomeotic(proximal) but not polyhomeotic(distal) is necessary for mitosis. To test if other PcG genes have roles in mitosis, we examined embryos derived from heterozygous PcG mutant females for mitotic defects. Severe defects in sister chromatid segregation and nuclear fallout, but not condensation are exhibited by Polycomb, Posterior sex combs and Additional sex combs. By contrast, mutations in Enhancer of zeste (which encodes the histone methyltransferase subunit of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2) exhibit condensation but not segregation defects.

"Global and local missions of cAMP signaling in neural plasticity, learning, and memory",26300775,10.3389/fphar.2015.00161,"The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has been a popular model to study cAMP signaling and resultant behaviors due to its powerful genetic approaches.

Interestingly, these two mutant genes were originally identified on the basis of associative learning deficits. This commentary summarizes findings on the role of cAMP in Drosophila neuronal excitability, synaptic plasticity and memory. It mainly focuses on two distinct mechanisms (global versus local) regulating excitatory and inhibitory synaptic plasticity related to cAMP homeostasis. This dual regulatory role of cAMP is to increase the strength of excitatory neural circuits on one hand, but to act locally on postsynaptic GABA receptors to decrease inhibitory synaptic plasticity on the other. Thus the action of cAMP could result in a global increase in the neural circuit excitability and memory.

EGFR/MAPK signaling regulates the proliferation of Drosophila renal and nephric stem cells,25619598,10.1016/j.jgg.2014.11.007,"Tissue homeostasis, accomplished through the self-renewal and differentiation of resident stem cells, is critical for the maintenance of adult tissues throughout an animal's lifetime. Adult Drosophila Malpighian tubules (MTs or fly kidney) are maintained by renal and nephric stem cells (RNSCs) via self-renewing divisions, however, it is unclear how RNSC proliferation and differentiation are regulated. Here we show that EGFR/MAPK signaling is dispensable for RNSC maintenance, but required for RNSC proliferation in vivo. Inactivation of the EGFR/MAPK pathway blocks or greatly retards RNSC cell cycle progression; conversely, over-activation of EGFR/MAPK signaling results in RNSC over-proliferation and disrupts the normal differentiation of renablasts (RBs), the immediate daughters of RNSC divisions. Our data further suggest that EGFR/MAPK signaling functions independently of JAK/STAT signaling and that dMyc and CycE partially mediate EGFR/MAPK signaling in MTs. Together, our data suggest a principal role of EGFR/MAPK signaling in regulating RNSC proliferation, which may provide important clues for understanding mammalian kidney repair and regeneration following injury.",2015,"Sen Liu, Zhouhua Li, Yu Cai"
EVOLUTION. Fruit flies diversify their offspring in response to parasite infection,26273057,10.1126/science.aab1768,"The evolution of sexual reproduction is often explained by Red Queen dynamics: Organisms must continually evolve to maintain fitness relative to interacting organisms, such as parasites. Recombination accompanies sexual reproduction and helps diversify an organism's offspring, so that parasites cannot exploit static host genotypes. Here we show that Drosophila melanogaster plastically increases the production of recombinant offspring after infection. The response is consistent across genetic backgrounds, developmental stages, and parasite types but is not induced after sterile wounding. Furthermore, the response appears to be driven by transmission distortion rather than increased recombination. Our study extends the Red Queen model to include the increased production of recombinant offspring and uncovers a remarkable ability of hosts to actively distort their recombination fraction in rapid response to environmental cues.",2015,"Todd A Schlenke, Shelly Skolfield, Erin S Keebaugh, Nadia D Singh, Dallas R Criscoe, Kathryn P Kohl"
Phenotype-based clustering of glycosylation-related genes by RNAi-mediated gene silencing,25940448,10.1111/gtc.12246,"Glycan structures are synthesized by a series of reactions conducted by glycosylation-related (GR) proteins such as glycosyltransferases, glycan-modifying enzymes, and nucleotide-sugar transporters. For example, the common core region of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) is sequentially synthesized by peptide-O-xylosyltransferase, β1,4-galactosyltransferase I, β1,3-galactosyltransferase II, and β1,3-glucuronyltransferase. This raises the possibility that functional impairment of GR proteins involved in synthesis of the same glycan might result in the same phenotypic abnormality. To examine this possibility, comprehensive silencing of genes encoding GR and proteoglycan core proteins was conducted in Drosophila. Drosophila GR candidate genes (125) were classified into five functional groups for synthesis of GAGs, N-linked, O-linked, Notch-related, and unknown glycans. Spatiotemporally regulated silencing caused a range of malformed phenotypes that fell into three types: extra veins, thick veins, and depigmentation. The clustered phenotypes reflected the biosynthetic pathways of GAGs, Fringe-dependent glycan on Notch, and glycans placed at or near nonreducing ends (herein termed terminal domains of glycans). Based on the phenotypic clustering, CG33145 was predicted to be involved in formation of terminal domains. Our further analysis showed that CG33145 exhibited galactosyltransferase activity in synthesis of terminal N-linked glycans. Phenotypic clustering, therefore, has potential for the functional prediction of novel GR genes.",2015,"Ryu Ueda, Shoko Nishihara, Megumi Maeda, Yoshinobu Kimura, Kiyoko F Aoki-Kinoshita, Miki Yamamoto-Hino, Hideki Yoshida, Akiko Kinoshita-Toyoda, Norihiko Sasaki, Hidenao Toyoda, Satoshi Goto, Tomomi Ichimiya, Sho Sakamura"
Photic entrainment in Drosophila assessed by locomotor activity recordings,25707274,10.1016/bs.mie.2014.10.017,"Light is the most important Zeitgeber to entrain the circadian clock of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster to the 24-h cycle on earth. The fruit fly's circadian clock is very light sensitive, mainly because about half of the 150 clock neurons in the fly's brain express the blue-light photopigment, Cryptochrome, which provokes an immediate degradation of the clock protein Timeless upon activation by light. Consequently, Drosophila's molecular clock can reset very fast to measure the changes in environmental-lighting conditions. However, usually the responses of the molecular clock to light are not directly measured, but conclusions about entrainment of the circadian clock are drawn from recording the flies' locomotor activity rhythms. Here, we review how the flies' locomotor activity can be recorded under different light regimes and how entrainment can be analyzed and properly judged. We also summarize the influence of different recording and lighting methods on the flies' activity pattern, highlight their advantages and disadvantages, and stress general pitfalls.",2015,"Charlotte Helfrich-Förster, Matthias Schlichting"
A role for E-cadherin in ensuring cohesive migration of a heterogeneous population of non-epithelial cells,26272476,10.1038/ncomms8998,"Collective cell migration is a key process underlying the morphogenesis of many organs as well as tumour invasion, which very often involves heterogeneous cell populations. Here we investigated how such populations can migrate cohesively in the Drosophila posterior midgut, comprised of epithelial and mesenchymal cells and show a novel role for the epithelial adhesion molecule E-cadherin (E-Cad) in mesenchymal cells. Despite a lack of junctions at the ultrastructure level, reducing E-Cad levels causes mesenchymal cells to detach from one another and from neighbouring epithelial cells; as a result, coordination between the two populations is lost. Moreover, Bazooka and recycling mechanisms are also required for E-Cad accumulation in mesenchymal cells. These results indicate an active role for E-Cad in mediating cohesive and ordered migration of non-epithelial cells, and discount the notion of E-Cad as just an epithelial feature that has to be switched off to enable migration of mesenchymal cells.",2015,"Jordi Casanova, Kyra Campbell"
Evolution of Drosophila resistance against different pathogens and infection routes entails no detectable maintenance costs,26496003,10.1111/evo.12782,"Pathogens exert a strong selective pressure on hosts, entailing host adaptation to infection. This adaptation often affects negatively other fitness-related traits. Such trade-offs may underlie the maintenance of genetic diversity for pathogen resistance. Trade-offs can be tested with experimental evolution of host populations adapting to parasites, using two approaches: (1) measuring changes in immunocompetence in relaxed-selection lines and (2) comparing life-history traits of evolved and control lines in pathogen-free environments. Here, we used both approaches to examine trade-offs in Drosophila melanogaster populations evolving for over 30 generations under infection with Drosophila C Virus or the bacterium Pseudomonas entomophila, the latter through different routes. We find that resistance is maintained after up to 30 generations of relaxed selection. Moreover, no differences in several classical life-history traits between control and evolved populations were found in pathogen-free environments, even under stresses such as desiccation, nutrient limitation, and high densities. Hence, we did not detect any maintenance costs associated with resistance to pathogens. We hypothesize that extremely high selection pressures commonly used lead to the disproportionate expression of costs relative to their actual occurrence in natural systems. Still, the maintenance of genetic variation for pathogen resistance calls for an explanation.",2015,"Tânia Paulo, Nelson E Martins, Sara Magalhães, Vítor G Faria, Élio Sucena, Luís Teixeira"

Speed and sensitivity of phototransduction in Drosophila depend on degree of saturation of membrane phospholipids,25673862,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1150-14.2015,"Drosophila phototransduction is mediated via a G-protein-coupled PLC cascade. Recent evidence, including the demonstration that light evokes rapid contractions of the photoreceptors, suggested that the light-sensitive channels (TRP and TRPL) may be mechanically gated, together with protons released by PLC-mediated PIP2 hydrolysis. If mechanical gating is involved we predicted that the response to light should be influenced by altering the physical properties of the membrane. To achieve this, we used diet to manipulate the degree of saturation of membrane phospholipids. In flies reared on a yeast diet, lacking polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), mass spectrometry showed that the proportion of polyunsaturated phospholipids was sevenfold reduced (from 38 to ∼5%) but rescued by adding a single species of PUFA (linolenic or linoleic acid) to the diet. Photoreceptors from yeast-reared flies showed a 2- to 3-fold increase in latency and time to peak of the light response, without affecting quantum bump waveform. In the absence of Ca(2+) influx or in trp mutants expressing only TRPL channels, sensitivity to light was reduced up to ∼10-fold by the yeast diet, and essentially abolished in hypomorphic G-protein mutants (Gαq). PLC activity appeared little affected by the yeast diet; however, light-induced contractions measured by atomic force microscopy or the activation of ectopic mechanosensitive gramicidin channels were also slowed ∼2-fold. The results are consistent with mechanosensitive gating and provide a striking example of how dietary fatty acids can profoundly influence sensory performance in a classical G-protein-coupled signaling cascade.",2015,"Michael J O Wakelam, Alex S Randall, Brian Chu, Che-Hsiung Liu, Roger C Hardie, Qifeng Zhang, Sidharta A Dongre, Kristian Franze, Mikko Juusola"
Spectroscopic characterization of radicals and radical pairs in fruit fly cryptochrome - protonated and nonprotonated flavin radical-states,25879256,10.1111/febs.13299,"Drosophila melanogaster cryptochrome is one of the model proteins for animal blue-light photoreceptors. Using time-resolved and steady-state optical spectroscopy, we studied the mechanism of light-induced radical-pair formation and decay, and the photoreduction of the FAD cofactor. Exact kinetics on a microsecond to minutes timescale could be extracted for the wild-type protein using global analysis. The wild-type exhibits a fast photoreduction reaction from the oxidized FAD to the FAD(•-) state with a very positive midpoint potential of ~ +125 mV, although no further reduction could be observed. We could also demonstrate that the terminal tryptophan of the conserved triad, W342, is directly involved in electron transfer; however, photoreduction could not be completely inhibited in a W342F mutant. The investigation of another mutation close to the FAD cofactor, C416N, rather unexpectedly reveals accumulation of a protonated flavin radical on a timescale of several seconds. The obtained data are critically discussed with the ones obtained from another protein, Escherichia coli photolyase, and we conclude that the amino acid opposite N(5) of the isoalloxazine moiety of FAD is able to (de)stabilize the protonated FAD radical but not to significantly modulate the kinetics of any light-inducted reactions.",2015,"Lorenz Heidinger, Stefan Weber, Ulrike Benz, Lisa Mann, Christoph Herkersdorf, Csaba Bajzath, Patricia Stehle, Petra Hellwig, Viktoria Kromm, Bernd Paulus, Frédéric Melin, Erik Schleicher"
Evolutionary divergence of Threonine Aspartase1 leads to species-specific substrate recognition,25720119,10.1515/hsz-2014-0318,"Proteases are key regulators of life. Human Threonine Aspartase1 processes substrates, such as the mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) protein, containing two cleavage sites, CS1 and CS2. Likewise, MLL's Drosophila ortholog trithorax is cleaved by Drosophila Threonine Aspartase1 (dTasp), suggesting a mechanistic coevolution. However, a detailed analysis of dTasp's function was missing so far. Here, active and inactive dTasp mutants allowed to compare substrate recognition and cleavage site selectivity of human and Drosophila enzymes. In contrast to the human protease, our cell-based assay revealed a preferential processing of CS2-like (QLD↓Gx[xD/Dx]) targets for dTasp, whereas cleavage of CS1-like targets (QVD↓Gx[xD/Dx]) was significantly impaired. Systematic mutagenesis of the CS2 sequence defined the motif x[FILMW]D↓Gx[xD/Dx] as the consensus cleavage sequence for dTasp. Substrate species selectivity of the enzymes was uncovered by demonstrating that dTasp cleaves Drosophila TFIIA, but not the human ortholog, suggesting evolutionary divergence of TFIIA downstream networks. Also, Drosophila USF2 was neither predicted nor cleaved by dTasp. Moreover, we found that dTasp cleavage site selectivity is independent of heterocomplex formation, as dTasp exists predominantly as an αβ-monomer. Collectively, we provide novel insights into evolutionary similarities and divergence concerning Threonine Aspartase1 function in different species, which may aid to dissect and better target human Threonine Aspartase1 in malignancies.",2015,"Angelina Hahlbrock, Shirley K Knauer, Sandra Bäcker, Christian Schrenk, Christina Heiselmayer, Oliver Schilling, Désirée Wünsch, Franziska Benne"
Dietary sugar promotes systemic TOR activation in Drosophila through AKH-dependent selective secretion of Dilp3,25882208,10.1038/ncomms7846,"Secreted ligands of the insulin family promote cell growth and maintain sugar homeostasis. Insulin release is tightly regulated in response to dietary conditions, but how insulin-producing cells (IPCs) coordinate their responses to distinct nutrient signals is unclear. Here we show that regulation of insulin secretion in Drosophila larvae has been segregated into distinct branches-whereas amino acids promote the secretion of Drosophila insulin-like peptide 2 (Dilp2), circulating sugars promote the selective release of Dilp3. Dilp3 is uniquely required for the sugar-mediated activation of TOR signalling and suppression of autophagy in the larval fat body. Sugar levels are not sensed directly by the IPCs, but rather by the adipokinetic hormone (AKH)-producing cells of the corpora cardiaca, and we demonstrate that AKH signalling is required in the IPCs for sugar-dependent Dilp3 release. Thus, IPCs integrate multiple cues to regulate the secretion of distinct insulin subtypes under varying nutrient conditions.",2015,"Thomas P Neufeld, Jung Kim"
Quantitative genetic variance in experimental fly populations evolving with or without environmental heterogeneity,26362112,10.1111/evo.12771,"Heterogeneous environments are typically expected to maintain more genetic variation in fitness within populations than homogeneous environments. However, the accuracy of this claim depends on the form of heterogeneity as well as the genetic basis of fitness traits and how similar the assay environment is to the environment of past selection. Here, we measure quantitative genetic (QG) variance for three traits important for fitness using replicated experimental populations of Drosophila melanogaster evolving under four selective regimes: constant salt-enriched medium (Salt), constant cadmium-enriched medium (Cad), and two heterogeneous regimes that vary either temporally (Temp) or spatially (Spatial). As theory predicts, we found that Spatial populations tend to harbor more genetic variation than Temp populations or those maintained in a constant environment that is the same as the assay environment. Contrary to expectation, Salt populations tend to have more genetic variation than Cad populations in both assay environments. We discuss the patterns for QG variances across regimes in relation to previously reported data on genome-wide sequence diversity.

The bHLH Transcription Factor Hand Regulates the Expression of Genes Critical to Heart and Muscle Function in Drosophila melanogaster,26252215,10.1371/journal.pone.0134204,"Hand proteins belong to the highly conserved family of basic Helix-Loop-Helix transcription factors and are critical to distinct developmental processes, including cardiogenesis and neurogenesis in vertebrates. In Drosophila melanogaster a single orthologous hand gene is expressed with absence of the respective protein causing semilethality during early larval instars. Surviving adult animals suffer from shortened lifespan associated with a disorganized myofibrillar structure being apparent in the dorsal vessel, the wing hearts and in midgut tissue. Based on these data, the major biological significance of Hand seems to be related to muscle development, maintenance or function; however, up to now the physiological basis for Hand functionality remains elusive. Thus, the identification of genes whose expression is, directly or indirectly, regulated by Hand has considerable relevance with respect to understanding its biological functionality in flies and vertebrates. Beneficially, hand mutants are viable and exhibit affected tissues, which renders Drosophila an ideal model to investigate up- or downregulated target genes by a comparative microarray approach focusing on the respective tissues from mutant specimens. Our present work reveals for the first time that Drosophila Hand regulates the expression of numerous genes of diverse physiological relevancy, including distinct factors required for proper muscle development and function such as Zasp52 or Msp-300. These results relate Hand activity to muscle integrity and functionality and may thus be highly beneficial to the evaluation of corresponding hand phenotypes.",2015,"Heiko Meyer, Achim Paululat, Julia Hoffmann, Benjamin Hallier, Thomas Roeder, Markus Tögel"
Maturation of a central brain flight circuit in Drosophila requires Fz2/Ca²⁺ signaling,25955970,10.7554/eLife.07046,"The final identity of a differentiated neuron is determined by multiple signaling events, including activity dependent calcium transients.

Here, we demonstrate a requirement for Fz2/Ca(2+) signaling in determining the final differentiated state of a set of central brain dopaminergic neurons in Drosophila, referred to as the protocerebral anterior medial (PAM) cluster. Knockdown or inhibition of Fz2/Ca(2+) signaling during maturation of the flight circuit in pupae reduces Tyrosine Hydroxylase (TH) expression in the PAM neurons and affects maintenance of flight. Thus, we demonstrate that Fz2/Ca(2+) transients during development serve as a pre-requisite for normal adult behavior.

MARCM mutant clonal analysis and cell type specific RNAi revealed that Bunched and Madm were required within intestinal stem cells for proliferation. Transgenic expression of a tagged Bunched showed a cytoplasmic localization in midgut precursors, and the addition of a nuclear localization signal to Bunched reduced its function to cooperate with Madm to increase intestinal stem cell proliferation. Furthermore, the elevated cell growth and 4EBP phosphorylation phenotypes induced by loss of Tuberous Sclerosis Complex or overexpression of Rheb were suppressed by the loss of Bunched or Madm. Therefore, while the mammalian homolog of Bunched, TSC-22, is able to regulate transcription and suppress cancer cell proliferation, our data suggest the model that Bunched and Madm functionally interact with the TOR pathway in the cytoplasm to regulate the growth and subsequent division of intestinal stem cells.",2015,"Alexey Veraksa, Yingchao Nie, Y Tony Ip, Laurel A Raftery, Juan Carlos Duhart, Hugo Stocker, Qi Li, Alla Amcheslavsky"
Oral streptococci and nitrite-mediated interference of Pseudomonas aeruginosa,25312949,10.1128/IAI.02396-14,"The oral cavity harbors a diverse community of microbes that are physiologically unique. Oral microbes that exist in this polymicrobial environment can be pathogenic or beneficial to the host. Numerous oral microbes contribute to the formation of dental caries and periodontitis; however, there is little understanding of the role these microbes play in systemic infections. There is mounting evidence that suggests that oral commensal streptococci are cocolonized with Pseudomonas aeruginosa during cystic fibrosis pulmonary infections and that the presence of these oral streptococci contributes to improved lung function. The goal of this study was to examine the underlying mechanism by which Streptococcus parasanguinis antagonizes pathogenic P. aeruginosa. In this study, we discovered that oral commensal streptococci, including Streptococcus parasanguinis, Streptococcus sanguinis, and Streptococcus gordonii, inhibit the growth of P. aeruginosa and that this inhibition is mediated by the presence of nitrite and the production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by oral streptococci. The requirement of both H2O2 and nitrite for the inhibition of P. aeruginosa is due to the generation of reactive nitrogenous intermediates (RNI), including peroxynitrite. Transposon mutagenesis showed that a P. aeruginosa mutant defective in a putative ABC transporter permease is resistant to both streptococcus/nitrite- and peroxynitrite-mediated killing. Furthermore, S. parasanguinis protects Drosophila melanogaster from killing by P. aeruginosa in a nitrite-dependent manner.

Genome-Wide Scan Informed by Age-Related Disease Identifies Loci for Exceptional Human Longevity,26677855,10.1371/journal.pgen.1005728,"We developed a new statistical framework to find genetic variants associated with extreme longevity. The method, informed GWAS (iGWAS), takes advantage of knowledge from large studies of age-related disease in order to narrow the search for SNPs associated with longevity. To gain support for our approach, we first show there is an overlap between loci involved in disease and loci associated with extreme longevity. These results indicate that several disease variants may be depleted in centenarians versus the general population. Next, we used iGWAS to harness information from 14 meta-analyses of disease and trait GWAS to identify longevity loci in two studies of long-lived humans. In a standard GWAS analysis, only one locus in these studies is significant (APOE/TOMM40) when controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) at 10%. With iGWAS, we identify eight genetic loci to associate significantly with exceptional human longevity at FDR < 10%. We followed up the eight lead SNPs in independent cohorts, and found replication evidence of four loci and suggestive evidence for one more with exceptional longevity. The loci that replicated (FDR < 5%) included APOE/TOMM40 (associated with Alzheimer's disease), CDKN2B/ANRIL (implicated in the regulation of cellular senescence), ABO (tags the O blood group), and SH2B3/ATXN2 (a signaling gene that extends lifespan in Drosophila and a gene involved in neurological disease). Our results implicate new loci in longevity and reveal a genetic overlap between longevity and age-related diseases and traits, including coronary artery disease and Alzheimer's disease. iGWAS provides a new analytical strategy for uncovering SNPs that influence extreme longevity, and can be applied more broadly to boost power in other studies of complex phenotypes.",2015,"Nir Barzilai, Stuart K Kim, Daniela Mari, Edgar Dobriban, Chiara Pirazzini, Kristen Fortney, Gil Atzmon, Claudio Franceschi, Art B Owen, Daniela Monti, Paolo Garagnani"

Deletion analysis mapped the MORN4 binding to the proximal region of the MYO3A tail domain. MYO3A dependent MORN4 tip localization suggests that MYO3A functions as a motor that transports MORN4 to the filopodia tips and MORN4 may enhance MYO3A tip localization by tethering it to the plasma membrane at the protrusion tips.

In this study, we profiled the genome-wide pattern of trimethylation of Lys36 on histone 3 (H3K36me3) in the somatic cells of young and old Caenorhabditis elegans. We revealed a new role of H3K36me3 in maintaining gene expression stability through aging with important consequences on longevity. We found that genes with dramatic expression change during aging are marked with low or even undetectable levels of H3K36me3 in their gene bodies irrespective of their corresponding mRNA abundance. Interestingly, 3' untranslated region (UTR) length strongly correlates with H3K36me3 levels and age-dependent mRNA expression stability. A similar negative correlation between H3K36me3 marking and mRNA expression change during aging was also observed in Drosophila melanogaster, suggesting a conserved mechanism for H3K36me3 in suppressing age-dependent mRNA expression change. Importantly, inactivation of the methyltransferase met-1 resulted in a decrease in global H3K36me3 marks, an increase in mRNA expression change with age, and a shortened life span, suggesting a causative role of the H3K36me3 marking in modulating age-dependent gene expression stability and longevity.",2015,"Siu Sylvia Lee, Mintie Pu, Xiujuan Wang, Minghui Wang, Haiyuan Yu, Jason G Wood, Stephen L Helfand, Zhuoyu Ni"

However, when fruitless neurons are made to express RNAi specific for the SIFamide receptor, male flies engage in bisexual behavior, showing that SIFamide acts on fruitless neurons. If neurons expressing a SIFaR-gal4 transgene are killed by the apoptotic protein reaper or when these neurons express SIFamide receptor RNAi, males also show male-male courtship behavior.

Structural implications of weak Ca2+ block in Drosophila cyclic nucleotide-gated channels,26283200,10.1085/jgp.201511431,"Calcium permeability and the concomitant calcium block of monovalent ion current (""Ca(2+) block"") are properties of cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channel fundamental to visual and olfactory signal transduction. Although most CNG channels bear a conserved glutamate residue crucial for Ca(2+) block, the degree of block displayed by different CNG channels varies greatly. For instance, the Drosophila melanogaster CNG channel shows only weak Ca(2+) block despite the presence of this glutamate. We previously constructed a series of chimeric channels in which we replaced the selectivity filter of the bacterial nonselective cation channel NaK with a set of CNG channel filter sequences and determined that the resulting NaK2CNG chimeras displayed the ion selectivity and Ca(2+) block properties of the parent CNG channels. Here, we used the same strategy to determine the structural basis of the weak Ca(2+) block observed in the Drosophila CNG channel. The selectivity filter of the Drosophila CNG channel is similar to that of most other CNG channels except that it has a threonine at residue 318 instead of a proline. We constructed a NaK chimera, which we called NaK2CNG-Dm, which contained the Drosophila selectivity filter sequence. The high resolution structure of NaK2CNG-Dm revealed a filter structure different from those of NaK and all other previously investigated NaK2CNG chimeric channels. Consistent with this structural difference, functional studies of the NaK2CNG-Dm chimeric channel demonstrated a loss of Ca(2+) block compared with other NaK2CNG chimeras. Moreover, mutating the corresponding threonine (T318) to proline in Drosophila CNG channels increased Ca(2+) block by 16 times. These results imply that a simple replacement of a threonine for a proline in Drosophila CNG channels has likely given rise to a distinct selectivity filter conformation that results in weak Ca(2+) block.",2015,"Yee Ling Lam, Mehabaw Getahun Derebe, Weizhong Zeng, Youxing Jiang"

This involves both long and short range signaling mediated by either diffusible or cell anchored factors. In a variety of processes the heterophilic Irre Cell Recognition Module, consisting of the Neph-like proteins: Roughest, Kin of irre and of the Nephrin-like proteins: Sticks and Stones, Hibris, plays key roles in the recognition events of different cell types throughout development. In the present study these proteins are apically expressed in the adhesive belt of epithelial cells participating in sense organ development in a partially exclusive and asymmetric manner. Using mutant analysis the GAL4/UAS system, RNAi and gain of function we found an involvement of all four Irre Cell Recognition Module-proteins in the development of a highly structured array of sensory organs in the wing disc. The proteins secure the regular spacing of sensory organs showing partial redundancy and may function in early lateral inhibition events as well as in cell sorting processes. Comparisons with other systems suggest that the Irre Cell Recognition module is a key organizer of highly repetitive structures.",2015,"Mathis Winking, Gerit Arne Linneweber, Karl-Friedrich Fischbach"
A yeast artificial chromosome clone map of the Drosophila genome,8013915,,"We describe the mapping of 979 randomly selected large yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) clones of Drosophila DNA by in situ hybridization to polytene chromosomes. Eight hundred and fifty-five of the clones are euchromatic and have primary hybridization sites in the banded portions of the polytene chromosomes, whereas 124 are heterochromatic and label the chromocenter. The average euchromatic clone contains about 211 kb and, at its primary site, labels eight or nine contiguous polytene bands. Thus, the extent as well as chromosomal position of each clone has been determined. By direct band counts, we estimate our clones provide about 76% coverage of the euchromatin of the major autosomes, and 63% coverage of the X. When previously reported YAC mapping data are combined with ours, euchromatic coverage is extended to about 90% for the autosomes and 82% for the X. The distribution of gap sizes in our map and the coverage achieved are in good agreement with expectations based on the assumption of random coverage, indicating that euchromatic clones are essentially randomly distributed. However, certain gaps in coverage, including the entire fourth chromosome euchromatin, may be significant. Heterochromatic sequences are underrepresented among the YAC clones by two to three fold. This may result, at least in part, from underrepresentation of heterochromatic sequences in adult DNA (the source of most of the clones analyzed), or from clone instability.",1994,"J Yee, H Cai, P Kiefel, I Duncan"
The Drosophila broad-complex regulates developmental changes in transcription and chromatin structure of the 67B heat-shock gene cluster,8064852,10.1006/jmbi.1994.1512,"At the end of the third larval instar of Drosophila, ecdysone triggers the tissue-specific activation of gene expression. In cytogenetic and molecular studies, the Broad-complex (BR-C) locus has been defined as a key element in the hierarchy of hormonal regulation of gene activity. Here we show that BR-C function is required for the regulation of the small hsp genes, which are clustered in the 67B puff and are known to be activated by heat shock and by ecdysone during development. We have found that the genes of the 67B cluster are expressed differentially in the salivary glands. While hsp23 and hsp27 transcripts accumulate at relatively high levels, those of hsp22 and hsp26 are present at low and intermediate levels, respectively. The complete BR-C deficiency as well as mutations of the npr class reduce the expression of genes hsp23 and hsp27 by 95 to 99%. The analysis of mutants representing two subfunctions of the BR-C-l(1)2Bab and l(1)2Bc, has shown that the latter is principally required for complete hsp induction. As sites of DNase I hypersensitivity in chromatin are believed to correspond to gene regulatory sequences, we have studied the changes of chromatin structure in the 67B region at different states of hsp gene activity. Upon hormonal induction, at the onset of metamorphosis, additional DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHS) appear in the 5' regions, four DHSs are associated with hsp23 and two with hsp27. We suggest that they are due to the binding of the hormone-receptor complex and/or transcription factors, related to ecdysone action. Finally, two DHSs (at -1400 of hsp23 and at -1200 of hsp27) are absent in the mutant nuclei, and thus may correspond to the target sequences for the BR-C-dependent regulatory protein(s).",1994,"M Bellard, G Dretzen, E B Dubrovsky"

cDNA cloning and expression of the human homolog of the sea urchin fascin and Drosophila singed genes which encodes an actin-bundling protein,8068206,10.1089/dna.1994.13.821,"cDNA clones having extensive sequence identity with the sea urchin fascin and the Drosophila singed gene products were isolated from a human teratocarcinoma cDNA library. The human homolog, termed hsn, is a single-copy gene that was localized to human chromosome 7p22 by fluorescence in situ hybridization and is predicted to encode a 493-amino-acid product with a molecular mass of approximately 55,000. This protein would be similar in size to the fascin and singed proteins, as well as a previously described 55-kD actin-bundling protein that was purified from HeLa cells. Monoclonal antibodies directed against the 55-kD HeLa protein were reactive against a bacterially expressed hsn fusion protein, indicating that the hsn gene probably encodes the 55-kD protein. The hsn mRNA was variably expressed in all human tissues analyzed and was highly expressed in actively growing renal carcinoma cell lines and in activated, but not in resting, lymphocytes, suggesting a functional role for hsn in proliferation. The fascin family lacks homology with other characterized actin-binding proteins, and the high degree of evolutionary conservation of these proteins indicates a functional importance of their actin-bundling properties.",1994,"T Stackhouse, D R Duan, W M Linehan, M I Lerman, F Latif, F Matsumura, L Geil, Y Weng, F M Duh, W Modi"
Molecular phylogeny of the kinesin family of microtubule motor proteins,7983154,,"The rapidly expanding kinesin family of microtubule motor proteins includes proteins that are involved in diverse microtubule-based functions in the cell. Phylogenetic analysis of the motor regions of the kinesin proteins reveals at least five clearly defined groups that are likely to identify kinesins with different roles in basic cellular processes. Two of the groups are consistent with overall sequence similarity, while two groups contain proteins that are related in overall structure or function but show no significant sequence similarity outside the motor domain. One of these groups consists only of kinesin proteins with predicted C-terminal motor domains; another includes only kinesins required for mitotic spindle bipolarity. Drosophila Nod, presently an ungrouped protein, may represent a class of kinesins that, like the myosin I proteins, function as monomers. The analysis indicates that many types of kinesin proteins exist in eukaryotic organisms. At least two of the five groups identified in this analysis are expected to be present in most, or all, eukaryotes.",1994,"H V Goodson, S A Endow, S J Kang"
Directed overexpression of suppressor 2 of zeste and Posterior Sex Combs results in bristle abnormalities in Drosophila melanogaster,8313990,10.1006/dbio.1994.1039,"Three dominant second-chromosome rearrangement mutations in Drosophila melanogaster, Aristapedioid1 (Arp), vestigial-Depilate (vgD), and vestigial62 (vg62), result in developmental abnormalities of the bristle sense organs on the notum, abdomen, legs, and wing margin. The bristle abnormalities are associated with overexpression of Suppressor 2 of zeste (Su(z)2). We constructed and transformed into flies Hsp70:cDNA constructs for Su(z)2 and the related and neighboring Polycomb group (Pc-G) gene Posterior Sex Combs (Psc). Heat shock-induced overexpression of these two genes (hs-Su(z)2 and hs-Psc) resulted in similar bristle abnormalities that in a developmental stage-specific manner mimicked those seen with the three rearrangement mutations. In addition, hs-Psc overexpression at white prepupae was lethal. The bristle abnormalities are reminiscent of those seen with reduced function of Notch, a neurogenic gene. We found that hs-Su(z)2 overexpression reduced the expression of a lac z enhancer trap in the neurogenic gene neuralized. Previous experiments found that loss of function mutations in Su(z)2 resulted in no bristle abnormalities. Analysis of Psc mitotic clones revealed no essential function of Psc in bristle development. Antibody staining of salivary gland polytene chromosomes showed that after heat shock induction of hs-Psc, Psc protein binds ectopically to hundreds of polytene chromosome loci. These data suggest that the bristle abnormalities seen with overexpression of Su(z)2 and Psc may result from altered expression of genes involved in bristle sense organ development that are not normal regulatory targets of these genes.",1994,"E C Martin, P N Adler, E J Sharp"
Embryonic origin and differentiation of the Drosophila heart,28305624,10.1007/BF00360522,"We have followed the normal development of the different cell types associated with the Drosophila dorsal vessel, i.e. cardioblasts, pericardial cells, alary muscles, lymph gland and ring gland, by using several tissue-specific markers and transmission electron microscopy. Precursors of pericardial cells and cardioblasts split as two longitudinal rows of cells from the lateral mesoderm of segments T2-A7 (""cardiogenic region"") during stage 12. The lymph gland and dorsal part of the ring gland (corpus allatum) originate from clusters of lateral mesodermal cells located in T3 and T1/dorsal ridge, respectively. Cardioblast precursors are strictly segmentally organized; each of T2-A6 gives rise to six cardioblasts. While moving dorsally during the stages leading up to dorsal closure, cardioblast precursors become flattened, polarized cells aligned in a regular longitudinal row. At dorsal closure, the leading edges of the cardioblast precursors meet their contralateral counterparts. The lumen of the dorsal vessel is formed when the trailing edges of the cardioblast precursors of either side bend around and contact each other. The amnioserosa invaginates during dorsal closure and is transiently attached to the cardioblasts; however, it does not contribute to the cells associated with the dorsal vessel and degenerates during late embryogenesis. We describe ultrastructural characteristics of cardioblast differentiation and discuss similarities between cardioblast development and capillary differentiation in vertebrates.",1994,"Astrid Rugendorff, Amelia Younossi-Hartenstein, Volker Hartenstein"
Three distinct roles for the engrailed gene in Drosophila wing development,7704572,10.1016/s0960-9822(00)00247-5,"Background: The development of Drosophila includes stages at which the future component parts of the adult seem to be divided into distinct anterior and posterior compartments, with clones of cells restricted by their lineage to only one of the two compartments. The engrailed gene is thought to be a 'selector' gene that controls the expression of other genes to confer a 'posterior identity' on groups of cells that are related to each other by lineage. Consistent with this notion, engrailed encodes a homeo-domain-containing transcription factor that is expressed in all posterior developmental compartments of the fly. In this paper, the processes that are regulated by engrailed during morphogenesis of the fly wing are analyzed. Results: The effects of a total lack of engrailed function in the wing have been analyzed for the first time. This has revealed three different requirements for engrailed during wing development. It has a late role in patterning the wing margin, which includes cells within the anterior compartment. In addition, it is involved in the cell-cell interactions that maintain the expression of the decapentaplegic gene along the antero-posterior compartment boundary; decapentaplegic, in turn, controls growth through a mechanism that depends on the activity of the gene hedgehog, and the maintenance of the compartment boundary depends on these cell-cell interactions. Finally, there is a global requirement for engrailed in the control of growth through a hedgehog-independent mechanism. In fact, cell proliferation is induced after removal of the functions provided by both engrailed and a second gene, patched. Conclusions: The multiple roles of engrailed and the temporal specificity for each function of the gene suggest that engrailed does not act simply by assigning an identity to cells, as had been supposed previously, but rather that is has more complex roles. Establishment and maintenance of the antero-posterior compartment boundary does not depend exclusively on the engrailed gene product. In addition, engrailed plays a major role in the control of growth by a pathway independent of putative inducing signals.",1994,A Hidalgo
dishevelled and armadillo act in the wingless signalling pathway in Drosophila,7906389,10.1038/367080a0,The Wnt genes encode conserved secreted proteins that play a role in normal development and tumorigenesis. Little is known about the signal transduction pathways of Wnt gene products. One of the best characterized Wnt family members is the Drosophila segment polarity gene wingless. We have investigated whether segment polarity genes with a wingless-like phenotype mediate the wingless signal. We used a wingless transgene controlled by a heat-shock promoter for genetic epistasis experiments. We show that wingless acts through dishevelled and armadillo to affect the expression of the homeobox gene engrailed and cuticle differentiation.,1994,"J Noordermeer, J Klingensmith, R Nusse, N Perrimon"
An adhesion molecule-like protein that interacts with and is a substrate for a Drosophila receptor-linked protein tyrosine phosphatase,7961789,,"Receptor-linked protein tyrosine phosphatases (R-PTPs) are a large and diverse group of transmembrane signaling molecules. In Drosophila, four R-PTPs are localized to central nervous system axons in the embryo and may participate in assembly of the central nervous system axon array. In this paper, we identify and characterize a transmembrane glycoprotein, gp150, that selectively interacts with the catalytic domain of the axonal R-PTP DPTP10D. gp150 does not bind to a cysteine-to-serine active site mutant, and binding is inhibited by vanadate, suggesting that it interacts with the active site. It has an extracellular domain composed of 18 leucine-rich repeats, which are found in many adhesion molecules. Its short cytoplasmic domain contains 4 tyrosine residues in sequence contexts that suggest that they could interact with SH2 domain-containing effector molecules. The overall organization of the tyrosine motifs resembles that of antigen recognition activation motif signaling elements from receptors in the vertebrate immune system. The cytoplasmic domain of gp150 is a good substrate for v-Abl tyrosine kinase, and phosphorylated gp150 can be dephosphorylated efficiently in vitro by DPTP10D. We suggest that DPTP10D may function in vivo to regulate phosphorylation of gp150 and thereby control its interactions with downstream effectors.",1994,"S S Tian, K Zinn"

Microtubule movement by a biotinated kinesin bound to streptavidin-coated surface,8132586,,"Kinesin, an ATP-dependent microtubule motor, can be studied in vitro in motility assays where the kinesin is nonspecifically adsorbed to a surface. However, adsorption can inactivate kinesin and may alter its reaction kinetics. We therefore prepared a biotinated kinesin derivative, K612-BIO, and characterized its activity in solution and when bound to streptavidin-coated surfaces. K612-BIO consists of the N-terminal 612 amino acids of the Drosophila kinesin alpha subunit linked to the 87-amino acid C-terminal domain of the biotin carboxyl carrier protein subunit of Escherichia coli acetyl-CoA carboxylase. The C-terminal domain directs the efficient post-translational biotination of the protein. We expressed K612-BIO at high levels using the baculovirus expression vector system and purified it to near-homogeneity. The expressed protein is completely soluble, and > 90% is bound by streptavidin. K612-BIO steady-state ATPase kinetics (KM,ATP = 24 microM, K0.5, microtubule = 0.61 mg ml-1, Vmax = approximately 25 s-1 head-1, 25 degrees C) are similar to those reported for intact kinesin. ATPase kinetics are not affected by the addition of streptavidin. Enzyme bound to a surface coated with streptavidin drove microtubule gliding in the presence of 2 mM ATP at 750 +/- 130 nm s-1 (26 degrees C). Activity was abolished by pretreatment of the surface with biotin, indicating that the microtubule movements are due to specifically bound enzyme. Motility assays based on specific attachment of biotinated enzyme to streptavidin-coated surfaces will be useful for quantitative analysis of kinesin motility and may provide a way to detect activity in kinesin derivatives or kinesin-like proteins that have not yet been shown to move microtubules.",1994,"H K Mahtani, E Berliner, J E Cronan Jr, L F Chu, S Karki, J Gelles"
"The full-length transcript of the I factor, a LINE element of Drosophila melanogaster, is a potential bicistronic RNA messenger",8036166,10.1093/nar/22.12.2370,"The I factor of Drosophila melanogaster is a retrotransposon of the LINE superfamily. The I factor displays two non-overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) that have the potential to encode for a nucleic acid-binding protein (ORF1) and a reverse transcriptase (ORF2). Retrotransposition of the I factor has been demonstrated and a putative full-length RNA intermediate has been identified. No other transcript from functional I factor has ever been described, suggesting that the full-length RNA is also used as a messenger. Here we report that a bicistronic RNA which conserves the ORF1-ORF2 organization of the I factor transcript is a template for ORF2 translation in vivo. We further demonstrate that the first AUG of ORF2 initiates translation, but efficiency of this initiation increases approximately 200 fold when ORF1 is deleted. Our results show that the I factor transcript may be used to translate both ORFs from their own initiation codons at different rates. Various mechanisms of translation are proposed.",1994,"H Pinon, K Bouhidel, C Terzian"
Drosophila syndecan: conservation of a cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan,8159748,10.1073/pnas.91.8.3334,"In mammals, cell-surface heparan sulfate is required for the action of basic fibroblast growth factor, fibronectin, antithrombin III, as well as other effectors. The syndecans, a gene family of four transmembrane proteoglycans that participates in these interactions, are the major source of this heparan sulfate. Based on the conserved transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the mammalian syndecans, a single syndecan-like gene was detected and localized in the Drosophila genome. As in mammals, Drosophila syndecan is a heparan sulfate proteoglycan expressed at the cell surface that can be shed from cultured cells. The single Drosophila syndecan is expressed in embryonic tissues that correspond with those tissues in mammals that express distinct members of the syndecan family predominantly. Conservation of this class of molecules suggests that Drosophila, like mammals, uses cell-surface heparan sulfate as a receptor or coreceptor for extracellular effector molecules.",1994,"J Spring, R O Hynes, S E Paine-Saunders, M Bernfield"
Molecular characterization of ovarian tumors in Drosophila,7811638,10.1016/0925-4773(94)90087-6,"Certain female-sterile mutations in Drosophila result in the uncontrolled proliferation of X/X germ cells. It has been proposed that this ovarian tumor phenotype results from the sexual transformation of X/X germ cells to a male identity. We present findings inconsistent with this model. We demonstrate that the tumorous cells produced by mutations in the ovarian tumor (otu), Sex-lethal (Sxl) and sans fille (snf) genes are capable of female-specific transcription and RNA processing. This indicates that these ovarian tumor cells still retain some female identity. Therefore, we propose that mutations in these genes do not cause a male transformation of the X/X germ line but instead either cause an ambiguous sexual identity or block specific stages of oogenesis. Our findings indicate that while Sxl is the master sex determination gene in somatic cells, it appears to play a more subsidiary role in the germ line. Finally, we demonstrate that the germ line function of Sxl depends on the activity of a specific OTU isoform.",1994,"E Bae, R N Nagoshi, K R Cook, P K Geyer"
Blistered: a gene required for vein/intervein formation in wings of Drosophila,7956840,,"We have characterized the blistered (bs) locus phenotypically, genetically and developmentally using a set of new bs alleles. Mutant defects range from wings with ectopic veins and intervein blisters to completely ballooned wings where the distinction between vein and intervein is lost. Mosaic analyses show that severe bs alleles behave largely autonomously; homozygous patches having vein-like properties. Developmental analyses were undertaken using light and electron microscopy of wild-type and bs wings as well as confocal microscopy of phalloidin- and laminin-stained preparations. bs defects were first seen early in the prepupal period with the failure of apposition of dorsal and ventral wing epithelia. Correspondingly, during definitive vein/intervein differentiation in the pupal period (18-36 hours after puparium formation), the extent of dorsal/ventral reapposition is reduced in bs wings. Regions of the wing that fail to become apposed differentiate properties of vein cells; i.e. become constricted apically and acquire a laminin-containing matrix basally. To further understand bs function, we examined genetic interactions between various bs alleles and mutants of two genes whose products have known functions in wing development. (i) rhomboid, a component of the EGF-R signalling pathway, is expressed in vein cells and is required for specification of vein cell fate. rhove mutations (lacking rhomboid in wings) suppress the excess vein formation and associated with bs. Conversely, rho expression in prepupal and pupal bs wings is expanded in the regions of increased vein formation. (ii) The integrin genes, inflated and myospheroid, are expressed in intervein cells and are required for adhesion between the dorsal and ventral wing surfaces. Loss of integrin function results in intervein blisters. Integrin mutants interact with bs mutants to increase the frequency of intervein blisters but do not typically enhance vein defects. Both developmental and genetic analyses suggest that the bs product is required during metamorphosis for the initiation of intervein development and the concomitant inhibition of vein development.",1994,"T B Kornberg, J W Fristrom, P Gotwals, S Eaton, D Fristrom, E Bier, M Sturtevant"
A novel and major isoform of tyrosine hydroxylase in Drosophila is generated by alternative RNA processing,7929381,,"We report that two isoforms of Drosophila tyrosine hydroxylase protein are encoded via alternatively spliced exons. The major isoform (Type II) contains a novel acidic extension of 71 amino acids in the amino-terminal regulatory domain, which is likely to alter the regulatory properties of the tyrosine hydroxylase protein. The minor isoform (Type I) corresponds to the cDNA sequence reported previously. We also report the structure of the Drosophila tyrosine hydroxylase (DTH) gene and the diversity and tissue localization of its transcripts. At least three types of DTH mRNA are generated from a single primary transcript through alternative splicing and polyadenylation. Type II mRNA is the most abundant tyrosine hydroxylase transcript in Drosophila and is found predominantly in the hypoderm throughout all stages of development. Type I mRNA is present only in the CNS, where it is the primary form. The DTH transcripts detected in the CNS contain a longer 3'-untranslated region than the transcript expressed in the hypoderm, due to differential polyadenylation. In contrast, the same start site is used for DTH gene transcription in both tissues. These results show unexpected diversity in the DTH transcripts and point out possible mechanisms for differential regulation of tyrosine hydroxylase activity in the CNS and in the hypoderm.",1994,"B Morgan, M Anzivino, J Hirsh, S Birman"

Phenotypic rescue by a bovine transgene in a Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase-null mutant of Drosophila melanogaster,8289809,10.1128/mcb.14.2.1302,"Null mutants for Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD) in Drosophila melanogaster are male sterile, have a greatly reduced adult life span, and are hypersensitive to paraquat. We have introduced a synthetic bovine CuZnSOD transgene under the transcriptional control of the D. melanogaster 5C actin promoter into a CuZnSOD-null mutant of D. melanogaster. This was carried out by P-element-mediated transformation of the Drosophila-bovine CuZnSOD transgene into a CuZnSOD+ recipient strain followed by genetic crossing of the transgene into a strain carrying the CuZnSOD-null mutation, cSODn108. The resulting transformants express bovine CuZnSOD exclusively to about 30% of normal Drosophila CuZnSOD levels. Expression of the Drosophila-bovine CuZnSOD transgene in the CuZnSOD-null mutant rescues male fertility and resistance to paraquat to apparently normal levels. However, adult life span is restored to only 30% of normal, and resistance to hyperoxia is 90% of that found in control flies. This striking differential restoration of pleiotropic phenotypes could be the result of a threshhold of CuZnSOD expression necessary for normal male fertility and resistance to the toxicity of paraquat or hyperoxia which is lower than the threshold required to sustain a normal adult life span. Alternatively, the differential rescue of fertility, resistance to active oxygen, and life span might indicate different cell-specific transcriptional requirements for these functions which are normally provided by the control elements of the native CuZnSOD gene but are only partly compensated for by the transcriptional control elements of the actin 5C promoter.",1994,"A Hilliker, B Duyf, J Phillips, J E Fleming, A Kongpachith, I Reveillaud"
The meiotic defects of mutants in the Drosophila mps1 gene reveal a critical role of Mps1 in the segregation of achiasmate homologs,15823541,10.1016/j.cub.2005.02.062,"The conserved kinase Mps1 is necessary for the proper functioning of the mitotic and meiotic spindle checkpoints (MSCs), which monitor the integrity of the spindle apparatus and prevent cells from progressing into anaphase until chromosomes are properly aligned on the metaphase plate. In Drosophila melanogaster, a null allele of the gene encoding Mps1 was recently shown to be required for the proper functioning of the MSC, but it did not appear to exhibit a defect in female meiosis. We demonstrate here that the meiotic mutant ald1 is a hypomorphic allele of the mps1 gene. Both ald1 and a P-insertion allele of mps1 exhibit defects in female meiotic chromosome segregation. The observed segregational defects are substantially more severe for pairs of achiasmate homologs, which are normally segregated by the achiasmate (or distributive) segregation system, than they are for chiasmate bivalents. Furthermore, cytological analysis of ald1 mutant oocytes reveals both a failure in the coorientation of achiasmate homologs at metaphase I and a defect in the maintenance of the chiasmate homolog associations that are normally observed at metaphase I. We conclude that Mps1 plays an important role in Drosophila female meiosis by regulating processes that are especially critical for ensuring the proper segregation of nonexchange chromosomes.",2005,"William D Gilliland, Sarah M Wayson, R Scott Hawley"
Cellular mechanisms of dendrite pruning in Drosophila: insights from in vivo time-lapse of remodeling dendritic arborizing sensory neurons,16033801,10.1242/dev.01928,"Regressive events that refine exuberant or inaccurate connections are critical in neuronal development. We used multi-photon, time-lapse imaging to examine how dendrites of Drosophila dendritic arborizing (da) sensory neurons are eliminated during early metamorphosis, and how intrinsic and extrinsic cellular mechanisms control this deconstruction. Removal of the larval dendritic arbor involves two mechanisms: local degeneration and branch retraction. In local degeneration, major branch severing events entail focal disruption of the microtubule cytoskeleton, followed by thinning of the disrupted region, severing and fragmentation. Retraction was observed at distal tips of branches and in proximal stumps after severing events. The pruning program of da neuron dendrites is steroid induced; cell-autonomous dominant-negative inhibition of steroid action blocks local degeneration, although retraction events still occur. Our data suggest that steroid-induced changes in the epidermis may contribute to dendritic retraction. Finally, we find that phagocytic blood cells not only engulf neuronal debris but also attack and sever intact branches that show signs of destabilization.",2005,"James W Truman, Darren W Williams"
Rapid iterative negative geotaxis (RING): a new method for assessing age-related locomotor decline in Drosophila,15919590,10.1016/j.exger.2005.02.005,"Age-related behavioral declines are common manifestations of aging in animals. Negative geotaxis, an innate escape response during which flies ascend the wall of a cylinder after being tapped to its bottom, is one of the behaviors that senesces in Drosophila. Many laboratories, including ours, have used a variety of negative geotaxis assays based on the performance of single flies. To circumvent limitations of single-fly assays, we developed a new method for assessing negative geotaxis called rapid iterative negative geotaxis (RING). In RING assays, digital photography is used to document negative geotaxis in multiple groups of animals simultaneously. We show that performance in RING assays is not influenced by the density of flies being tested, the time of day, or repeated testing. We used the RING assay to demonstrate that negative geotaxis declines with the age of animals as previously shown in single fly studies and that senescence of negative geotaxis is sensitive to genetic background. Finally, we used RING assays to show that long-lived Indy and chico mutants exhibit delayed senescence of negative geotaxis. Our results demonstrate that RING is a powerful method for assessing negative geotaxis that should facilitate the search for manipulations that influence behavioral aging in Drosophila.",2005,"Poonam Bhandari, Ian Martin, Michael S Grotewiel, Julia Warner Gargano"
The Drosophila Toucan protein is a new mitotic microtubule-associated protein required for spindle microtubule stability,15670212,10.1111/j.1365-2443.2004.00813.x,"Mitotic spindle dynamics are highly dependent on proteins that interact with microtubules to influence their organization or stability. Here, we show that the Drosophila Toucan protein interacts directly with microtubules. Its localization to the microtubule network when it is expressed in mammalian cells and its direct interaction with microtubules in vitro are dependent on its central basic domain. Moreover, Toc expression in mammalian cells strongly protects microtubules from depolymerization. By using in vivo inducible RNAi in syncytial embryos, we generated a dose-sensitive loss of function of toucan, demonstrating that this technique is an efficient method for inactivating a maternal transcript. This enabled us to accurately characterize several new mitotic defects from the early to the late phases of mitosis, depending on Toucan depletion level. Toucan is required for metaphase spindle formation and centrosome anchoring to the poles. Then, during anaphase, Toc depletion affects kinetochore microtubules and therefore chromosome segregation. Toc is also necessary for central spindle formation by the interpolar microtubules. In contrast, astral microtubules are not disturbed by Toc depletion. Taken together, our results show that Toucan is a microtubule-associated protein specifically required for the stability of spindle microtubules throughout mitosis.",2005,"Vincent Mirouse, Bernard Dastugue, Jean-Louis Couderc"
Mechanisms of Suppression of {alpha}-Synuclein Neurotoxicity by Geldanamycin in Drosophila,15556931,10.1074/jbc.M412106200,"Parkinson's disease is a common neurodegenerative disease characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta and the accumulation of the protein alpha-synuclein into aggregates called Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites. Parkinson's disease can be modeled in Drosophila where directed expression of alpha-synuclein induces compromise of dopaminergic neurons and the formation of Lewy body-like aggregates. The molecular chaperone Hsp70 protects cells from the deleterious effects of alpha-synuclein, indicating a potential therapeutic approach to enhance neuron survival in Parkinson's disease. We have now investigated the molecular mechanisms by which the drug geldanamycin protects neurons against alpha-synuclein toxicity. Our studies show that geldanamycin sensitizes the stress response within normal physiological parameters to enhance chaperone activation, offering protection against alpha-synuclein neurotoxicity. Further, geldanamycin uncouples neuronal toxicity from Lewy body and Lewy neurite formation such that dopaminergic neurons are protected from the effects of alpha-synuclein expression despite the continued presence of (and even increase in) inclusion pathology. These studies indicate that compounds that modulate the stress response are a promising approach to treat Parkinson's disease.",2005,"Marc C Meulener, Pavan K Auluck, Nancy M Bonini"
"Eater, a transmembrane protein mediating phagocytosis of bacterial pathogens in Drosophila",16239149,10.1016/j.cell.2005.08.034,"Phagocytosis is a complex, evolutionarily conserved process that plays a central role in host defense against infection. We have identified a predicted transmembrane protein, Eater, which is involved in phagocytosis in Drosophila. Transcriptional silencing of the eater gene in a macrophage cell line led to a significant reduction in the binding and internalization of bacteria. Moreover, the N terminus of the Eater protein mediated direct microbial binding which could be inhibited with scavenger receptor ligands, acetylated, and oxidized low-density lipoprotein. In vivo, eater expression was restricted to blood cells. Flies lacking the eater gene displayed normal responses in NF-kappaB-like Toll and IMD signaling pathways but showed impaired phagocytosis and decreased survival after bacterial infection.

Replication origin of mitochondrial DNA in insects,16118189,10.1534/genetics.105.046243,"The precise position of the replication origin (O(R)) of mtDNA was determined for insect species belonging to four different orders (four species of Drosophila, Bombyx mori, Triborium castaneum, and Locusta migratoria, which belong to Diptera, Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, and Orthoptera, respectively). Since the free 5' ends of the DNA strands of mtDNA are interpreted as the O(R), their positions were mapped at 1-nucleotide resolution within the A + T-rich region by using the ligation-mediated PCR method. In all species examined, the free 5' ends were found within a very narrow range of several nucleotides in the A + T-rich region. For four species of Drosophila, B. mori, and T. castaneum, which belong to holometabolous insects, although the O(R)'s were located at different positions, they were located immediately downstream of a series of thymine nucleotides, the so-called T-stretch. These results strongly indicate that the T-stretch is involved in the recognition of the O(R) of mtDNA at least among holometabolous insects. For L. migratoria (hemimetabolous insect), on the other hand, none of the long stretches of T's was found in the upstream portion of the O(R), suggesting that the regulatory sequences involved in the replication initiation process have changed through insect evolution.",2005,"Tadashi Aotsuka, Shigeru Saito, Koichiro Tamura"

Loss of Ku80 has more pronounced effects than loss of Ku70. However, lower Ku70 concentration reduces the stability of terminally deficient chromosomes.

RNAi induced in mammalian and Drosophila cells via transfection of dimers and trimers of small interfering RNA,19771208,,"Twenty one base pair long small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are widely in use in mammalian RNAi experiments. The present study assesses the capability of 43 and 63bp dsRNAs with two 2nt long 3'-overhangs to induce RNAi in mammalian and Drosophila cells. Human Dicer was found to cleave these dsRNAs from their ends to generate two or three monomeric siRNA units, each 21-22bp in length. When, in 43bp dsRNA, there was present a highly-effective siRNA sequence in frame with respect to the Dicer digestion, considerably high RNAi activity was noted to be induced in mouse embryonic stem E14TG2a, human HeLa, Chinese hamster CHO-K1 or Drosophila S2 cells. In contrast, RNAi depending on 63bp dsRNA, containing a highly effective siRNA sequence in frame with respect to Dicer digestion, varied considerably depending on cell lines used. While there was no appreciable RNAi in HeLa cells associated with relatively strong interferon response, a significant level of RNAi was noted in E14TG2a, CHO-K1 and S2 cells, in all of which interferon response induction was but slight, if at all. It would thus follow that siRNA oligomers with sequence of a highly functional siRNA monomer unit in frame with respect to dicer digestion should serve as a good RNAi agent in Drosophila and certain mammalian cells.",2005,"Shuhei Zenno, Kumiko Ui-Tei, Aya Juni, Kaoru Saigo"
Neuronal expression of p53 dominant-negative proteins in adult Drosophila melanogaster extends life span,16303568,10.1016/j.cub.2005.10.051,"Hyperactivation of p53 leads to a reduction in tumor formation and an unexpected shortening of life span in two different model systems . The decreased life span occurs with signs of accelerated aging, such as osteoporosis, reduction in body weight, atrophy of organs, decreased stress resistance, and depletion of hematopoietic stem cells. These observations suggest a role for p53 in the determination of life span and the speculation that decreasing p53 activity may result in positive effects on some aging phenotypes . In this report, we show that expression of dominant-negative versions of Drosophila melanogaster p53 in adult neurons extends life span and increases genotoxic stress resistance in the fly. Consistent with this, a naturally occurring allele with decreased p53 activity has been associated with extended survival in humans . Expression of the dominant-negative Drosophila melanogaster p53 constructs does not further increase the extended life span of flies that are calorie restricted, suggesting that a decrease in p53 activity may mediate a component of the calorie-restriction life span-extending pathway in flies.",2005,"Heather Glatt-Deeley, Peter C Poon, Stephen L Helfand, John M Abrams, Johannes H Bauer"

An ovine NCL form is caused by a recessive point mutation in the cathepsin D gene, which encodes a lysosomal aspartyl protease. This mutation results in typical NCL pathology with neurodegeneration and characteristic neuronal storage material. We have generated a Drosophila NCL model by inactivating the conserved Drosophila cathepsin D homolog. We report here that cathepsin D mutant flies exhibit the key features of NCLs. They show progressive neuronal accumulation of autofluorescent storage inclusions, which are also positive for periodic acid Schiff and luxol fast blue stains. Ultrastructurally, the storage material is composed of membrane-bound granular electron-dense material, similar to the granular osmiophilic deposits found in the human infantile and ovine congenital NCL forms.

However, it has been unclear how lateral localization of Drosophila PAR-1 is achieved and whether this localization contributes to epithelial polarity in vivo. Here we show that, through its spacer domain, Drosophila PAR-1 accumulates on the lateral plasma membrane (PM) in cells of the follicular epithelium (FE). Rescue experiments indicate that in FE cells PAR-1 kinase activity is essential for all the described functions of PAR-1. In contrast, the spacer domain of PAR-1 is required for apical-basal polarity and growth control but is dispensable for microtubule (MT) stabilization.

This is especially important for the study of a complex behavior that can be dramatically affected by small changes in environmental conditions. Several different types of cell migrations occur during Drosophila development. In this chapter, we focus on cell migrations that have been subjected to the most intense scrutiny. We describe each of the cell types and their trajectories and provide information regarding markers that are useful for the study of each cell type and mutations that affect their migrations. In addition, we provide protocols for staining embryos and manipulating gene function in each of the migratory populations.

Transepithelial transport of fluorescent p-glycoprotein and MRP2 substrates by insect Malpighian tubules: confocal microscopic analysis of secreted fluid droplets,16339857,10.1242/jeb.01911,"Transport of fluorescent substrates of p-glycoprotein (P-gp) and multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2) by insect Malpighian tubules was examined using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Isolated tubules of the cricket Teleogryllus commodus accumulated the MRP2 substrate Texas Red in the cells and lumen at concentrations up to 20 and 40 times, respectively, those in the bathing medium. Quantitative CLSM analysis of fluorochrome transport in some cricket tubules and all Drosophila tubules was not practical because of interfering effects of concretions in the cells and lumen. Samples of fluid secreted by tubules set up in Ramsay assays were therefore collected in hollow rectangle glass capillaries. Transepithelial dye flux was calculated as the product of fluid secretion rate (measured in the Ramsay assay) and dye concentration (measured by CLSM of the fluid samples). Dose-response curves for transport and the ratio of dye concentration in the secreted fluid to that in the bathing medium (S/M) were determined for Texas Red as well as for P-gp substrates (rhodamine 123, daunorubicin), the organic anion fluorescein and the organic cation quinacrine. Transepithelial transport of Texas Red was reduced by the MRP2 inhibitors MK571 and probenecid. Transport of daunorubicin was reduced by the P-gp inhibitors verapamil and quinacrine and also by the organic cation tetraethylammonium.

FAM20: an evolutionarily conserved family of secreted proteins expressed in hematopoietic cells,15676076,10.1186/1471-2164-6-11,"Background: Hematopoiesis is a complex developmental process controlled by a large number of factors that regulate stem cell renewal, lineage commitment and differentiation. Secreted proteins, including the hematopoietic growth factors, play critical roles in these processes and have important biological and clinical significance. We have employed representational difference analysis to identify genes that are differentially expressed during experimentally induced myeloid differentiation in the murine EML hematopoietic stem cell line. Results: One identified clone encoded a previously unidentified protein of 541 amino acids that contains an amino terminal signal sequence but no other characterized domains. This protein is a member of family of related proteins that has been named family with sequence similarity 20 (FAM20) with three members (FAM20A, FAM20B and FAM20C) in mammals. Evolutionary comparisons revealed the existence of a single FAM20 gene in the simple vertebrate Ciona intestinalis and the invertebrate worm Caenorhabditis elegans and two genes in two insect species, Drosophila melanogaster and Anopheles gambiae. Six FAM20 family members were identified in the genome of the pufferfish, Fugu rubripes and five members in the zebrafish, Danio rerio. The mouse Fam20a protein was ectopically expressed in a mammalian cell line and found to be a bona fide secreted protein and efficient secretion was dependent on the integrity of the signal sequence. Expression analysis revealed that the Fam20a gene was indeed differentially expressed during hematopoietic differentiation and that the other two family members (Fam20b and Fam20c) were also expressed during hematcpoiesis but that their mRNA levels did not vary significantly. Likewise FAM20A was expressed in more limited set of human tissues than the other two family members. Conclusions: The FAM20 family represents a new family of secreted proteins with potential functions in regulating differentiation and function of hematopoietic and other tissues. The Fam20a mRNA was only expressed during early stages of hematopoietic development and may play a role in lineage commitment or proliferation. The expansion in gene number in different species suggests that the family has evolved as a result of several gene duplication events that have occurred in both vertebrates and invertebrates.",2005,"Demet Nalbant, Yang Du, S Isil Nalbant, Everardo Cobos, Hyewon Youn, Elmus G Beale, Savitha Sharma, Simon C Williams"
Molecular genetics of spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 (SCA8),17132942,10.4161/rna.2.2.1682,"Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) belong to a group of autosomal dominant, late-onset neurodegenerative disorders characterized by slowly progressive ataxia that eventually leads to severe gait, speech, coordination and sensory loss. The majority of these diseases result from expanded polyglutamine tracts in the encoded protein as seen in SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7 and Dentatorubral-Pallidoluysian Atrophy (DRPLA). However, two novel forms of SCAs, SCA8 and SCA12, are associated with trinucleotide repeat expansions in non-translated regions of the genes. In the case of SCA8, the CUG expansion occurs at the 3' end of a processed non-coding RNA. While understanding of how expanded polyglutamine tracts compromise or alter protein function has advanced rapidly in the last five years, understanding of how trinucleotide repeat expansions alter the function of the non-coding SCA8 RNA and lead to human disease remains quite limited. Encouragingly, as discussed in this review, recent studies from murine and Drosophila models have provided new insights into both the cellular context in which SCA8 normally operates and the potential role of CTG expansion in the disease. Continued exploration of these genetically tractable model systems will further illuminate the biology underlying SCA8 disease, ultimately providing the necessary foundation on which to develop effective therapeutic interventions.",2005,"Mousumi Mutsuddi, Ilaria Rebay"
Use of AFLP markers in surveys of arthropod diversity,15865967,10.1016/S0076-6879(05)95011-8,"Arthropods comprise the most diverse group of animals on earth and as such have been the subject of considerable evolutionary research. For example, much of our understanding of the genetic basis of evolutionary change is derived from the insect genus Drosophila, one of the most well-studied organisms in biology. Arthropods are also of tremendous economic importance as both providers and chief destroyers of food for human consumption. Thus, the genetic diversity of arthropods is of interest from both a pure research perspective and for practical economic reasons. The amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) method of genetic analysis, developed in the early and mid-1990s (Vos et al., 1995; Zabeau, 1992; Zabeau and Vos, 1993), offers a relatively new method for assessing genetic diversity and has been increasingly applied in studies of arthropods. Originally coined selective restriction fragment amplification (SRFA) (Zabeau and Vos, 1993), the method was renamed (Vos et al., 1995) presumably to reflect its similarity to restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). Since then, AFLPs have become a popular tool in both population genetics to estimate population parameters such as heterozygosity, F-statistics, migration rates, and genetic distances, as well as phylogenetics, to infer relationships among closely related taxa. In arthropods, AFLPs have been used to assess genetic variation both within and between species in various taxa including crustaceans, chelicerates, and insects, often yielding novel insights. In this chapter, we briefly describe the AFLP method and its strengths and limitations. We then discuss the use of AFLPs in surveys of arthropod diversity, highlighting the specific questions addressed using AFLPs.

Unconventional mechanisms control cyclic respiratory gas release in flying Drosophila,16169942,10.1242/jeb.01788,"The high power output of flight muscles places special demands on the respiratory gas exchange system in insects. In small insects, respiration relies on diffusion, and for elevated locomotor performance such as flight, instantaneous gas exchange rates typically co-vary with the animal's metabolic activity. By contrast, under certain conditions, instantaneous release rate of carbon dioxide from the fruit fly Drosophila flying in a virtual-reality flight arena may oscillate distinctly at low frequency (0.37+/-0.055 Hz), even though flight muscle mechanical power output requires constant metabolic activity. Cross-correlation analysis suggests that this uncoupling between respiratory and metabolic rate is not driven by conventional types of convective flow reinforcement such as abdominal pumping, but might result from two unusual mechanisms for tracheal breathing. Simplified analytical modeling of diffusive tracheal gas exchange suggests that cyclic release patterns in the insect occur as a consequence of the stochastically synchronized control of spiracle opening area by the four large thoracic spiracles. Alternatively, in-flight motion analysis of the abdomen and proboscis using infra-red video imaging suggests utilization of the proboscis extension reflex (PER) for tracheal convection. Although the respiratory benefit of synchronized spiracle opening activity in the fruit fly is unclear, proboscis-induced tracheal convection might potentially help to balance the local oxygen supply between different body compartments of the flying animal.",2005,"Fritz-Olaf Lehmann, Nicole Heymann"

Molecular characterization of Drosophila NELF,15741180,10.1093/nar/gki274,"NELF and DSIF act together to inhibit transcription elongation in vitro, and are implicated in causing promoter proximal pausing on the hsp70 gene in Drosophila. Here, further characterization of Drosophila NELF is provided. Drosophila NELF has four subunits similar to subunits of human NELF.

Immunodepletion of NELF or DSIF from a nuclear extract desensitizes transcription in vitro to DRB. Immunodepletion of NELF also impairs promoter proximal pausing on the hsp70 promoter in vitro without affecting initiation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses detect NELF at the promoters of the hsp70 and beta1-tubulin genes where promoter proximal pausing has been previously detected. Heat shock induction of hsp70 results in a marked decrease in NELF at the hsp70 promoter.

An unexpected consequence, however, has been an increase in the number of age-related diseases and, in particular, neurodegenerative diseases. Despite their prevalence, a therapeutic void exists in part due to an incomplete understanding of the biochemical pathogenesis of these diseases. A powerful method that can be used to understand the basic mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative diseases is to generate animal models based on manipulating the expression of single genes that are disease causative. This approach has been facilitated by the fact that many neurodegenerative diseases are inherited as autosomal dominant traits such that expression of the mutant gene in a model organism might be expected to recapitulate the disease. During the past few years, the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, has emerged as a powerful tool to model human neurodegenerative diseases.

E(z) exists in a multiprotein complex called Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) that also contains Su(z)12, Esc and Nurf55. Reconstituted recombinant PRC2 methylates nucleosomes in vitro, but recombinant E(z) on its own shows only poor HMTase activity on nucleosomes. Here, we investigate the function of the PRC2 subunits. We show that PRC2 binds to nucleosomes in vitro but that individual PRC2 subunits alone do not bind to nucleosomes. By analysing PRC2 subcomplexes, we show that Su(z)12-Nurf55 is the minimal nucleosome-binding module of PRC2 and that Esc contributes to high-affinity binding of PRC2 nucleosomes. We find that nucleosome binding of PRC2 is not sufficient for histone methylation and that only complexes that contain Esc protein show robust HMTase activity. These observations suggest that different subunits provide mechanistically distinct functions within the PRC2 HMTase: the nucleosome-binding subunits Su(z)12 and Nurf55 anchor the E(z) enzyme on chromatin substrates, whereas Esc is needed to boost enzymatic activity.",2005,"Jürg Müller, Brigitte Wild, Maxim Nekrasov"
cAMP-response element-binding protein and heat-shock protein 70 additively suppress polyglutamine-mediated toxicity in Drosophila,16009936,10.1073/pnas.0503937102,"Gene-specific expansion of polyglutamine-encoding CAG repeats can cause neurodegenerative disorders, including Huntington's disease.

A mutation in the Drosophila homolog of CREB, dCREB2, enhances lethality due to polyglutamine peptides (polyQ), and an additional copy of dCREB2 partially rescues this lethality. Neuronal expression of expanded polyQ attenuates in vivo CRE-mediated transcription of a reporter gene. As reported previously, overexpression of heat-shock protein 70 (Hsp70) rescues polyglutamine-dependent lethality. However, it does not rescue CREB-mediated transcription.

Drosophila melanogaster Rac2 is necessary for a proper cellular immune response,16098145,10.1111/j.1365-2443.2005.00883.x,"It has been reported that during Drosophila embryonic development, and in cell culture, that the Rac GTPases are redundant. To better elucidate Rac function in Drosophila, we decided to study the role of Rac2 in larval cellular defense reactions against the parasitiod Leptopilina boulardi. Here we show a dramatic effect in the context of cellular immunity where, unlike embryonic development, Rac2 appears to have a non-redundant function. When an invading parasitoid is recognized as foreign, circulating hemocytes (blood cells) should recognize and attach to the egg chorion. After attachment the hemocytes should then spread to form a multilayered capsule surrounding the invader. In Rac2 mutants this process is disrupted. Immune surveillance cells, known as plasmatocytes, adhere to the parasitoid egg but fail to spread, and septate junctions do not assemble, possibly due to mislocalization of the Protein 4.1 homolog Coracle. Finally, larger cells known as lamellocytes attach to the capsule but also fail to spread, and there is a lack of melanization. From these results it appears that Rac2 is necessary for the larval cellular immune response.",2005,"Dan Hultmark, Istvan Ando, Michael J Williams"

Mutation of Aplip1 caused larval paralysis, axonal swellings, and reduced levels of both anterograde and retrograde vesicle transport, similar to the effects of kinesin-1 inhibition. In contrast, Aplip1 mutation caused a decrease only in retrograde transport of mitochondria, suggesting inhibition of the minus-end microtubule motor cytoplasmic dynein . Consistent with dynein defects, combining heterozygous mutations in Aplip1 and Dynein heavy chain (Dhc64C) generated synthetic axonal transport phenotypes. Thus, APLIP1 may be an important part of motor-cargo linkage complexes for both kinesin-1 and dynein. However, it is also worth considering that APLIP1 and its associated JNK signaling proteins could serve as an important signaling module for regulating transport by the two opposing motors.",2005,"William M Saxton, Rosemarie V Barkus, Dai Horiuchi, Andrew Gassman, Aaron D Pilling"
Analysis of the transcriptional activation domain of the Drosophila tango bHLH-PAS transcription factor,15818484,10.1007/s00427-004-0462-9,"Basic-helix-loop-helix-PAS transcription factors play important roles in diverse biological processes including cellular differentiation and specification, oxygen tension regulation and dioxin metabolism. Drosophila tango is orthologous to mammalian Arnt and acts as a common dimerization partner for bHLH-PAS proteins during embryogenesis. A transient transfection assay using Drosophila S2 tissue culture cells and wild-type and mutant Drosophila tango cDNAs was used to localize the activation domain of the Tango protein. An activation domain was identified in the C-terminus of TGO consisting of poly-glutamine and histidine-proline repeats. Transcriptional activation of the fibroblast growth factor receptor (breathless) gene required an intact TGO C-terminus, in vitro. Co-expression assays of trachealess and tgo in the developing eye imaginal disc showed a requirement for the C-terminal transactivation domain of TGO for a cellular response. Genetic analysis of tgo(3) shows that the paired repeat is necessary for tracheal tubule formation in all branches. Lastly, expression of a C-terminal truncated tgo transgene specifically in the CNS midline and trachea resulted in reductions in the number of breathless-expressing cells. These results together identify TGO's transactivation domain and establish its importance for proper target gene regulation and cellular specification.",2005,"Christopher Delvecchio, Margaret J Sonnenfeld, Xuetao Sun"
Physiological mechanisms of TRPC activation,16133266,10.1007/s00424-005-1416-4,"TRPC (canonical transient receptor potential) channels are vertebrate homologs of the Drosophila photoreceptor channel, TRP. Considerable research has been brought to bear on the seven members of this family, especially with regard to their possible role in calcium entry. Unfortunately, the current literature presents a confusing picture, with different laboratories producing widely differing results and interpretations. It appears that ectopically expressed TRPC channels can be activated by phospholipase C products (generally, diacylglycerols), by stimulation of trafficking to the plasma membrane, or by depletion of intracellular Ca(2+) stores. Here, I discuss the possibility that these diverse experimental findings arise because TRPC channels can, under both experimental as well as physiological conditions, be activated in three distinct ways, possibly depending on their subunit composition and/or signaling complex environment. The TRPCs may be unique among ion-channel subunit families in being able to participate in the assembly and function of multiple types of physiologically important ion channels.",2005,James W Putney
Slingshot cofilin phosphatase localization is regulated by receptor tyrosine kinases and regulates cytoskeletal structure in the developing Drosophila eye,16169194,10.1016/j.mod.2005.07.002,"Animal development requires that positional information act on the genome to control cell fate and cell shape. The primary determinant of animal cell shape is the cytoskeleton and thus the mechanisms by which extracellular signals influence the cytoskeleton are crucial for morphogenesis. In the developing Drosophila compound eye, localized polymerization of actin functions to constrict the apical surface of epithelial cells, both at the morphogenetic furrow and later to maintain the coherence of the nascent ommatidia. As elsewhere, actin polymerization in the developing eye is regulated by ADF/cofilin ('Twinstar', or 'Tsr' in Drosophila), which is activated by Slingshot (Ssh), a cofilin phosphatase. Here we show that Ssh does act in the developing eye to limit actin polymerization in the assembling ommatidia, but not in the morphogenetic furrow. While Ssh does control cell shape, surprisingly there are no direct or immediate consequences for cell type. Ssh protein becomes apically concentrated in cells that express elevated levels of the Sevenless (Sev) receptor-tyrosine kinase (RTK), even those which receive no ligand. We interpret this as a non-signal driven, RTK-dependent localization of Ssh to allow for locally increased actin filament turnover. We suggest that there are two modes of actin remodeling in the developing eye: a non-RTK, non-Ssh mediated mechanism in the morphogenetic furrow, and an RTK and Ssh-dependent mode during ommatidial assembly.",2005,"Frank Hsiung, Kevin Moses, Edward M Rogers, Aloma B Rodrigues"
Natural selection and genetic variation for female resistance to harm from males,15842486,10.1111/j.1420-9101.2004.00872.x,"The sexual conflict hypothesis predicts that males evolve traits that exploit the higher parental investment of females, which generates selection for females to counter-evolve resistance. In Drosophila melanogaster it is now established that males harm females and that there is genetic variation among males for the degree of this harm. Genetic variation among females for resistance to harm from males, and the corresponding strength of selection on this variation, however, have not been quantified previously. Here we carryout a genome-wide screen for female resistance to harm from males. We estimate that the cost of interactions with males depresses lifetime fecundity of females by 15% (95% CI: 8.2-22.0), that genetic variation for female resistance constitutes 17% of total genetic variation for female adult fitness, and that propensity to remate in response to persistent male courtship is a major factor contributing to genetic variation for female resistance.",2005,"J E Linder, W R Rice"
Bili inhibits Wnt/beta-catenin signaling by regulating the recruitment of axin to LRP6,19572019,10.1371/journal.pone.0006129,"Background: Insights into how the Frizzled/LRP6 receptor complex receives, transduces and terminates Wnt signals will enhance our understanding of the control of the Wnt/ss-catenin pathway. Methodology/principal findings: In pursuit of such insights, we performed a genome-wide RNAi screen in Drosophila cells expressing an activated form of LRP6 and a beta-catenin-responsive reporter. This screen resulted in the identification of Bili, a Band4.1-domain containing protein, as a negative regulator of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. We found that the expression of Bili in Drosophila embryos and larval imaginal discs significantly overlaps with the expression of Wingless (Wg), the Drosophila Wnt ortholog, which is consistent with a potential function for Bili in the Wg pathway. We then tested the functions of Bili in both invertebrate and vertebrate animal model systems. Loss-of-function studies in Drosophila and zebrafish embryos, as well as human cultured cells, demonstrate that Bili is an evolutionarily conserved antagonist of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. Mechanistically, we found that Bili exerts its antagonistic effects by inhibiting the recruitment of AXIN to LRP6 required during pathway activation. Conclusions: These studies identify Bili as an evolutionarily conserved negative regulator of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway.",2009,"Randall T Moon, Binita Changkakoty, William H Conrad, Travis Biechele, Lorna S Kategaya, Ramanuj Dasgupta, Ajamete Kaykas"
"Anopheles gambiae Croquemort SCRBQ2, expression profile in the mosquito and its potential interaction with the malaria parasite Plasmodium berghei",19366631,10.1016/j.ibmb.2009.03.008,"The scavenger receptor family comprises transmembrane proteins involved in the recognition of polyanionic ligands. Several studies have established that members of this family are involved both in immunity and in developmental processes. In Drosophila melanogaster, one of the best characterized scavenger receptors is Croquemort, which participates in the recognition of apoptotic cells in the embryo. Although comparative genomic studies have revealed the presence of four orthologs of this receptor in the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae, little is known about their function. We have investigated the expression pattern of the four Croquemort orthologs during the mosquito life cycle. Croquemort transcripts SCRBQ2 and SCRBQ4 are expressed at all the developmental stages, while expression of Croquemort transcripts SCRBQ1 and SCRBQ3 is more restricted. We have also investigated the expression of the four Croquemort orthologs in the different organs of the adult female. Croquemort transcript SCRBQ2 is highly expressed in the A. gambiae female midgut. SCRBQ2 midgut gene expression was up-regulated after a non-infected or a Plasmodium berghei-infected blood meal, compared to its expression in midguts of sugar-fed females. Interestingly, knockdown of SCRBQ2 expression by dsRNA injection resulted in a 62.5% inhibition of oocyst formation, suggesting that SCRBQ2 plays a role in Plasmodium-mosquito interactions.",2009,"Marcelo Jacobs-Lorena, Martin Laclaustra, Fidel de la Cruz Hernández-Hernández, Mario Henry Rodríguez, Leopoldo Flores-Romo, Rhoel R Dinglasan, Mónica González-Lázaro"
The ASH1 HOMOLOG 2 (ASHH2) histone H3 methyltransferase is required for ovule and anther development in Arabidopsis,19915673,10.1371/journal.pone.0007817,"Background: SET-domain proteins are histone lysine (K) methyltransferases (HMTase) implicated in defining transcriptionally permissive or repressive chromatin. The Arabidopsis ASH1 HOMOLOG 2 (ASHH2) protein (also called SDG8, EFS and CCR1) has been suggested to methylate H3K4 and/or H3K36 and is similar to Drosophila ASH1, a positive maintainer of gene expression, and yeast Set2, a H3K36 HMTase. Mutation of the ASHH2 gene has pleiotropic developmental effects. Here we focus on the role of ASHH2 in plant reproduction. Methodology/principal findings: A slightly reduced transmission of the ashh2 allele in reciprocal crosses implied involvement in gametogenesis or gamete function. However, the main requirement of ASHH2 is sporophytic. On the female side, close to 80% of mature ovules lack embryo sac. On the male side, anthers frequently develop without pollen sacs or with specific defects in the tapetum layer, resulting in reduction in the number of functional pollen per anther by up to approximately 90%. In consistence with the phenotypic findings, an ASHH2 promoter-reporter gene was expressed at the site of megaspore mother cell formation as well as tapetum layers and pollen. ashh2 mutations also result in homeotic changes in floral organ identity. Transcriptional profiling identified more than 300 up-regulated and 600 down-regulated genes in ashh2 mutant inflorescences, whereof the latter included genes involved in determination of floral organ identity, embryo sac and anther/pollen development. This was confirmed by real-time PCR. In the chromatin of such genes (AP1, AtDMC1 and MYB99) we observed a reduction of H3K36 trimethylation (me3), but not H3K4me3 or H3K36me2. Conclusions/significance: The severe distortion of reproductive organ development in ashh2 mutants, argues that ASHH2 is required for the correct expression of genes essential to reproductive development. The reduction in the ashh2 mutant of H3K36me3 on down-regulated genes relevant to the observed defects, implicates ASHH2 in regulation of gene expression via H3K36 trimethylation in chromatin of Arabidopsis inflorescences.",2009,"Zoe A Wilson, Vibeke Alm, Tage Thorstensen, Reidunn B Aalen, Gema Vizcay-Barrena, Paul E Grini, Susanne S Windju, Tommy S Jørstad"
Comparative gene expression in the heads of Drosophila melanogaster and Tribolium castaneum and the segmental affinity of the Drosophila hypopharyngeal lobes,19196336,10.1111/j.1525-142X.2008.00305.x,"Drosophila melanogaster has long played an important role in debates surrounding insect and arthropod head segmentation. It is surprising, therefore, that one important feature of Drosophila head segmentation has remained controversial: namely the position of the boundary between the intercalary and mandibular segments. The Drosophila embryonic head has a pair of structures lying behind the stomodeum known as the hypopharyngeal lobes. Traditionally they have been seen as part of the intercalary segment. More recent work looking at the position of the lobes relative to various marker genes has been somewhat equivocal: segment polarity gene expression has been used to argue for a mandibular affinity of these lobes, while the expression of the anterior-most hox gene labial (lab) has supported an intercalary affinity. We have addressed the question of the segmental affinity of the hypopharyngeal lobes by conducting a detailed comparison of gene expression patterns between Drosophila and the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum, in which the intercalary segment is unambiguously marked out by lab. We demonstrate that there is a large degree of conservation in gene expression patterns between Drosophila and Tribolium, and this argues against an intercalary segment affinity for the hypopharyngeal lobes. The lobes appear to be largely mandibular in origin, although some gene expression attributed to them appears to be associated with the stomodeum. We propose that the difficulties in interpreting the Drosophila head result from a topological shift in the Drosophila embryonic head, associated with the derived process of head involution.",2009,"Maximilian J Telford, Andrew D Economou"
Coiled-coil-mediated dimerization is not required for myosin VI to stabilize actin during spermatid individualization in Drosophila melanogaster,19005209,10.1091/mbc.e08-07-0776,"Myosin VI is a pointed-end-directed actin motor that is thought to function as both a transporter of cargoes and an anchor, capable of binding cellular components to actin for long periods. Dimerization via a predicted coiled coil was hypothesized to regulate activity and motor properties. However, the importance of the coiled-coil sequence has not been tested in vivo. We used myosin VI's well-defined role in actin stabilization during Drosophila spermatid individualization to test the importance in vivo of the predicted coiled coil. If myosin VI functions as a dimer, a forced dimer should fully rescue myosin VI loss of function defects, including actin stabilization, actin cone movement, and cytoplasmic exclusion by the cones. Conversely, a molecule lacking the coiled coil should not rescue at all. Surprisingly, neither prediction was correct, because each rescued partially and the molecule lacking the coiled coil functioned better than the forced dimer. In extracts, no cross-linking into higher molecular weight forms indicative of dimerization was observed. In addition, a sequence required for altering nucleotide kinetics to make myosin VI dimers processive is not required for myosin VI's actin stabilization function. We conclude that myosin VI does not need to dimerize via the predicted coiled coil to stabilize actin in vivo.",2009,"Kathryn G Miller, Mamiko Isaji, Deborah J Frank, Tatsuhiko Noguchi"

A novel role of the glial fate determinant glial cells missing in hematopoiesis,19598118,10.1387/ijdb.082726cj,"Glial cell deficient/Glial cells missing (Glide/Gcm) transcription factor is expressed in all glial precursors of the Drosophila embryo. Gcm is necessary and sufficient to induce glial differentiation but also plays a role in other cell types, by interacting with specific factors. To find potential partners of Gcm which trigger these other pathways, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen and identified dpias, a gene involved in post-embryonic hematopoiesis. dpias larvae show melanotic tumors due to excess of lamellocytes, a hemocyte lineage that is involved in non-self recognition. We here show that blocking Gcm activity also triggers melanotic tumors and that gcm interacts genetically with dpias. Moreover, the members of the Janus Kinase (JAK)/ Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT) pathway, which are known for their role in the vertebrate and invertebrate immune system and are required for dpias-dependent tumor formation, act downstream of Gcm. Altogether, this study identifies an unpredicted role of Gcm, dictated by its cofactor dpias, allowing Gcm to act in a specific pathway. Together with the recent finding that glia act as scavengers during development and in pathological conditions, our data open new perspectives onto the cellular and molecular pathways involved in non-self recognition within and outside the nervous system.",2009,"Angela Giangrande, Céline Diebold, Cécile Jacques, István Nagy, Laurent Soustelle"
Brain tumor stem cells,19856100,10.1007/s11064-009-0079-5,"Primary malignant brain cancer, one of the most deadly diseases, has a high rate of recurrence after treatment. Studies in the past several years have led to the hypothesis that the root of the recurrence may be brain tumor stem cells (BTSCs), stem-like subpopulation of cells that are responsible for propagating the tumor. Current treatments combining surgery and chemoradiotherapy could not eliminate BTSCs because these cells are highly infiltrative and possess several properties that can reduce the damages caused by radiation or anti-cancer drugs. BTSCs are similar to NSCs in molecular marker expression and multi-lineage differentiation potential. Genetic analyses of Drosophila CNS neoplasia, mouse glioma models, and human glioma tissues have revealed a link between increased NSC self-renewal and brain tumorigenesis. Furthermore, data from various rodent models of malignant brain tumors have provided compelling evidence that multipotent NSCs and lineage-restricted neural progenitor cells (NPCs) could be the cell origin of brain tumors. Thus, the first event of brain tumorigenesis might be the occurrence of oncogenic mutations in the stem cell self-renewal pathway in an NSC or NPC. These mutations convert the NSC or NPC to a BTSC, which then initiates and sustains the growth of the tumor. The self-renewal of BTSCs is controlled by several evolutionarily conserved signaling pathways and requires an intact vascular niche. Targeting these pathways and the vascular niche could be a principle in novel brain tumor therapies aimed to eliminate BTSCs.",2009,Zhigang Xie
Regulation of energy stores and feeding by neuronal and peripheral CREB activity in Drosophila,20041126,10.1371/journal.pone.0008498,"The cAMP-responsive transcription factor CREB functions in adipose tissue and liver to regulate glycogen and lipid metabolism in mammals. While Drosophila has a homolog of mammalian CREB, dCREB2, its role in energy metabolism is not fully understood. Using tissue-specific expression of a dominant-negative form of CREB (DN-CREB), we have examined the effect of blocking CREB activity in neurons and in the fat body, the primary energy storage depot with functions of adipose tissue and the liver in flies, on energy balance, stress resistance and feeding behavior. We found that disruption of CREB function in neurons reduced glycogen and lipid stores and increased sensitivity to starvation. Expression of DN-CREB in the fat body also reduced glycogen levels, while it did not affect starvation sensitivity, presumably due to increased lipid levels in these flies. Interestingly, blocking CREB activity in the fat body increased food intake. These flies did not show a significant change in overall body size, suggesting that disruption of CREB activity in the fat body caused an obese-like phenotype. Using a transgenic CRE-luciferase reporter, we further demonstrated that disruption of the adipokinetic hormone receptor, which is functionally related to mammalian glucagon and beta-adrenergic signaling, in the fat body reduced CRE-mediated transcription in flies. This study demonstrates that CREB activity in either neuronal or peripheral tissues regulates energy balance in Drosophila, and that the key signaling pathway regulating CREB activity in peripheral tissue is evolutionarily conserved.",2009,"Christopher Shenton, LiJuan Zhao, Kanae Iijima-Ando, Koichi Iijima"
The benefits of male ejaculate sex peptide transfer in Drosophila melanogaster,19032499,10.1111/j.1420-9101.2008.01638.x,"The accessory gland protein (Acp) ejaculate molecules of male Drosophila melanogaster mediate sexual selection and sexual conflict at the molecular level. However, to date no studies have comprehensively measured the timing and magnitude of fitness benefits to males of transferring specific Acps. This is an important omission because without this information it is not possible to fully understand the strength and form of selection acting on adaptations such as Acps. Here, we measured the fitness benefits to males of ejaculate sex peptide (SP) transfer. SP is of interest because it is a candidate for mediating sexual conflict: its frequent receipt reduces female fitness. In single matings with virgin females SP is known to increase egg laying and decrease receptivity. Hence, we predicted that SP could: (i) boost a male's absolute paternity by increasing offspring production and delaying female remating and/or (ii) boost relative paternity share. We tested these predictions using two different lines of SP-lacking males, in both two-mating and free-mating assay conditions. SP transfer conferred higher absolute, but not relative, male reproductive success. In matings with virgin females, SP transfer increased mating productivity and delayed remating and hence the onset of sperm competition. In already mated females, SP transfer did not elevate absolute progeny production, but did increase intermating intervals and hence the period over which a male could gain paternity. Consistent with this, under free-mating conditions over an extended period, we detected a 'per-mating' fitness benefit for males transferring SP. These benefits are consistent with a role for SP in mediating conflict, with SP acting to maximize short-term fitness benefits for males.",2009,"T Chapman, C Fricke, R Hobbs, S Wigby"
Persistent competition among stem cells and their daughters in the Drosophila ovary germline niche,19211674,10.1242/dev.033340,"Cell competition is a short-range cell-cell interaction leading to the proliferation of winner cells at the expense of losers, although either cell type shows normal growth in homotypic environments. Drosophila Myc (dMyc; Dm-FlyBase) is a potent inducer of cell competition in wing epithelia, but its role in the ovary germline stem cell niche is unknown. Here, we show that germline stem cells (GSCs) with relative lower levels of dMyc are replaced by GSCs with higher levels of dMyc. By contrast, dMyc-overexpressing GSCs outcompete wild-type stem cells without affecting total stem cell numbers. We also provide evidence for a naturally occurring cell competition border formed by high dMyc-expressing stem cells and low dMyc-expressing progeny, which may facilitate the concentration of the niche-provided self-renewal factor BMP/Dpp in metabolically active high dMyc stem cells. Genetic manipulations that impose uniform dMyc levels across the germline produce an extended Dpp signaling domain and cause uncoordinated differentiation events. We propose that dMyc-induced competition plays a dual role in regulating optimal stem cell pools and sharp differentiation boundaries, but is potentially harmful in the case of emerging dmyc duplications that facilitate niche occupancy by pre-cancerous stem cells. Moreover, competitive interactions among stem cells may be relevant for the successful application of stem cell therapies in humans.",2009,"Offer Gerlitz, Marta Portela, Juan F Poyatos, Begoña Díaz, Irene Fernández-Ruiz, Christa Rhiner, Eduardo Moreno, Jesús M López-Gay"

To address this challenge, we systematically characterized Xiwi, a Xenopus Piwi homologue, and piRNAs from Xenopus eggs and oocytes. We used the large size of Xenopus eggs to analyze small RNAs at the single cell level, and find abundant piRNAs and large piRNA clusters in the Xenopus tropicalis genome, some of which resemble the Drosophila piRNA-generating flamenco locus. Although most piRNA clusters are expressed simultaneously in an egg, individual frogs show distinct profiles of cluster expression. Xiwi is associated with microtubules and the meiotic spindle, and is localized to the germ plasm--a cytoplasmic determinant of germ cell formation. Xiwi associates with translational regulators in an RNA-dependent manner, but Xenopus tudor interacts with Xiwi independently of RNA. Our study adds insight to piRNA transcription regulation by showing that individual animals can have differential piRNA expression profiles.

Perhaps rate-limiting and under the control of the prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH), the biosynthesis of 3-oxo-7dC and its subsequent oxidative modifications have been difficult to study because of their apparent instability, i.e. no intermediates between 7dC and the diketol (3-oxo-25,22,2-trideoxyecdysone) have ever been observed or identified in insect prothoracic gland incubations with radiolabelled precursors.

In this manner, 3-oxo-7dC is quickly and efficiently incorporated into ecdysteroids by adult male and female Drosophila raised on a diet containing the PSKB ketals and in prothoracic glands of Manduca sexta incubated with the ketals emulsified into media.

Cav2-type calcium channels encoded by cac regulate AP-independent neurotransmitter release at cholinergic synapses in adult Drosophila brain,19004991,10.1152/jn.91103.2008,"Voltage-gated calcium channels containing alpha1 subunits encoded by Ca(v)2 family genes are critical in regulating release of neurotransmitter at chemical synapses. In Drosophila, cac is the only Ca(v)2-type gene. Cacophony (CAC) channels are localized in motor neuron terminals where they have been shown to mediate evoked, but not AP-independent, release of glutamate at the larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Cultured embryonic neurons also express CAC channels, but there is no information about the properties of CAC-mediated currents in adult brain nor how these channels regulate transmission in central neural circuits where fast excitatory synaptic transmission is predominantly cholinergic. Here we report that wild-type neurons cultured from late stage pupal brains and antennal lobe projection neurons (PNs) examined in adult brains, express calcium currents with two components: a slow-inactivating current sensitive to the spider toxin Plectreurys toxin II (PLTXII) and a fast-inactivating PLTXII-resistant component. CAC channels are the major contributors to the slow-inactivating PLTXII-sensitive current based on selective reduction of this component in hypomorphic cac mutants (NT27 and TS3). Another characteristic of cac mutant neurons both in culture and in whole brain recordings is a reduced cholinergic miniature excitatory postsynaptic current frequency that is mimicked in wild-type neurons by acute application of PLTXII. These data demonstrate that cac encoded Ca(v)2-type calcium channels regulate action potential (AP)-independent release of neurotransmitter at excitatory cholinergic synapses in the adult brain, a function not predicted from studies at the larval NMJ.",2009,"Andy An Hoang, Hailing Su, Diane K O'Dowd, Jorge Iniguez, Shaojuan Amy Jiang, Monica Lavian, Huaiyu Gu, Jorge M Campusano, Xicui Sun"

Here we examine the requirement for DNases during two examples of programmed cell death (PCD) that occurs in the Drosophila melanogaster ovary, starvation-induced death of mid-stage egg chambers and developmental nurse cell death in late oogenesis. Surprisingly, we found that DNaseII was required cell autonomously in nurse cells during developmental PCD, indicating that it acts within dying cells. Dying nurse cells contain autophagosomes, indicating that autophagy may contribute to these forms of PCD. Furthermore, we provide evidence that developmental nurse cell PCD in late oogenesis shows hallmarks of necrosis.

The effect of pathogens on selection against deleterious mutations in Drosophila melanogaster,19694894,10.1111/j.1420-9101.2009.01830.x,"In natural populations, fitness is reduced by both deleterious mutations and parasites. Few studies have examined interactions between these two factors, particularly at the level of individual genes. We examined how the presence of a bacterial pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, affected the selection against each of eight deleterious mutations in Drosophila melanogaster. We found that mutations tended to become more deleterious in the presence of disease. This increase in the average selection was primarily due to three genes with the remainder showing little evidence of change.",2009,"Jadene A Young, Aneil F Agrawal, Christopher P Yourth"
Neurocircuit assays for seizures in epilepsy mutants of Drosophila,19369924,10.3791/1121,"Drosophila melanogaster is a useful tool for studying seizure like activity. A variety of mutants in which seizures can be induced through either physical shock or electrical stimulation is available for study of various aspects of seizure activity and behavior. All flies, including wild-type, will undergo seizure-like activity if stimulated at a high enough voltage. Seizure like activity is an all-or-nothing response and each genotype has a specific seizure threshold. The seizure threshold of a specific genotype of fly can be altered either by treatment with a drug or by genetic suppression or enhancement. The threshold is easily measured by electrophysiology. Seizure-like activity can be induced via high frequency electrical stimulation delivered directly to the brain and recorded through the dorsal longitudinal muscles (DLMs) in the thorax. The DLMs are innervated by part of the giant fiber system. Starting with low voltage, high frequency stimulation, and subsequently raising the voltage in small increments, the seizure threshold for a single fly can be measured.",2009,"Mark A Tanouye, Iris C Howlett"
Evaluation of hydrogen bonds of ecdysteroids in the ligand-receptor interactions using a protein modeling system,19631551,10.1016/j.bmc.2009.07.011,"The insect molting hormone, 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) and its analogs (ecdysteroids) specifically bind to the ecdysone receptor. Previously, we synthesized various ecdysteroids containing the side chain moiety of ponasterone A (PonA), and measured the binding activity against Drosophila Kc cells to study the structure-activity relationship. Here we quantitatively analyzed the structure-activity relationship for the ligand binding of ecdysteroids including 20E and PonA. Since the hydrogen bonding (HB) is one of the important physicochemical properties for ligand binding to the ecdysteroid receptor, the number of possible HBs between the ligand molecule and the receptor was manually counted in the modeled ligand-receptor complex for all compounds. The construction of the ligand-receptor model was executed by the full-automatic modeling system (FAMS) in which calculation was done by simulated annealing. The binding potency of 15 ecdysteroids to Kc-cells were linearly correlated (r(2)=0.63) with the number of HBs which are observed between ligand and receptor molecule. Contribution of steric and electrostatic effects on the ligand-receptor binding was also examined using a three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (3-D QSAR), comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA).",2009,"Miki Akamatsu, Toshiyuki Harada, Hisashi Miyagawa, Yoshiaki Nakagawa"
From form to function: the ways to know a neuron,19132600,10.1080/01677060802610604,"The shape of a neuron, its morphological signature, dictates the neuron's function by establishing its synaptic partnerships. Here, we review various anatomical methods used to reveal neuron shape and the contributions these have made to our current understanding of neural function in the Drosophila brain, especially the optic lobe. These methods, including Golgi impregnation, genetic reporters, and electron microscopy (EM), necessarily incorporate biases of various sorts that are easy to overlook, but that filter the morphological signatures we see. Nonetheless, the application of these methods to the optic lobe has led to reassuringly congruent findings on the number and shapes of neurons and their connection patterns, indicating that morphological classes are actually genetic classes. Genetic methods using, especially, GAL4 drivers and associated reporters have largely superceded classical Golgi methods for cellular analyses and, moreover, allow the manipulation of neuronal activity, thus enabling us to establish a bridge between morphological studies and functional ones. While serial-EM reconstruction remains the only reliable, albeit labor-intensive, method to determine actual synaptic connections, genetic approaches in combination with EM or high-resolution light microscopic techniques are promising methods for the rapid determination of synaptic circuit function.",2009,"Chun-Yuan Ting, Chi-Hon Lee, Shin-ya Takemura, Songling Huang, Ian A Meinertzhagen, Shuying Gao, Zhiyuan Lu"
"Stable, precise, and reproducible patterning of bicoid and hunchback molecules in the early Drosophila embryo",19714200,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000486,"Precise patterning of morphogen molecules and their accurate reading out are of key importance in embryonic development. Recent experiments have visualized distributions of proteins in developing embryos and shown that the gradient of concentration of Bicoid morphogen in Drosophila embryos is established rapidly after fertilization and remains stable through syncytial mitoses. This stable Bicoid gradient is read out in a precise way to distribute Hunchback with small fluctuations in each embryo and in a reproducible way, with small embryo-to-embryo fluctuation. The mechanisms of such stable, precise, and reproducible patterning through noisy cellular processes, however, still remain mysterious. To address these issues, here we develop the one- and three-dimensional stochastic models of the early Drosophila embryo. The simulated results show that the fluctuation in expression of the hunchback gene is dominated by the random arrival of Bicoid at the hunchback enhancer. Slow diffusion of Hunchback protein, however, averages out this intense fluctuation, leading to the precise patterning of distribution of Hunchback without loss of sharpness of the boundary of its distribution. The coordinated rates of diffusion and transport of input Bicoid and output Hunchback play decisive roles in suppressing fluctuations arising from the dynamical structure change in embryos and those arising from the random diffusion of molecules, and give rise to the stable, precise, and reproducible patterning of Bicoid and Hunchback distributions.",2009,"Masaki Sasai, Suguru Oho, Yurie Okabe-Oho, Hiroki Murakami"
Canalization of gene expression in the Drosophila blastoderm by gap gene cross regulation,19750121,10.1371/journal.pbio.1000049,"Developing embryos exhibit a robust capability to reduce phenotypic variations that occur naturally or as a result of experimental manipulation. This reduction in variation occurs by an epigenetic mechanism called canalization, a phenomenon which has resisted understanding because of a lack of necessary molecular data and of appropriate gene regulation models. In recent years, quantitative gene expression data have become available for the segment determination process in the Drosophila blastoderm, revealing a specific instance of canalization. These data show that the variation of the zygotic segmentation gene expression patterns is markedly reduced compared to earlier levels by the time gastrulation begins, and this variation is significantly lower than the variation of the maternal protein gradient Bicoid. We used a predictive dynamical model of gene regulation to study the effect of Bicoid variation on the downstream gap genes. The model correctly predicts the reduced variation of the gap gene expression patterns and allows the characterization of the canalizing mechanism. We show that the canalization is the result of specific regulatory interactions among the zygotic gap genes. We demonstrate the validity of this explanation by showing that variation is increased in embryos mutant for two gap genes, Krüppel and knirps, disproving competing proposals that canalization is due to an undiscovered morphogen, or that it does not take place at all. In an accompanying article in PLoS Computational Biology (doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000303), we show that cross regulation between the gap genes causes their expression to approach dynamical attractors, reducing initial variation and providing a robust output. These results demonstrate that the Bicoid gradient is not sufficient to produce gap gene borders having the low variance observed, and instead this low variance is generated by gap gene cross regulation. More generally, we show that the complex multigenic phenomenon of canalization can be understood at a quantitative and predictive level by the application of a precise dynamical model.",2009,"Carlos E Vanario-Alonso, Alexander V Spirov, John Reinitz, Vitaly V Gursky, David H Sharp, Svetlana Surkova, Ovidiu Radulescu, Ah-Ram Kim, Maria Samsonova, Hilde Janssens, Manu"
Linoleic acid inhibits TRP channels with intrinsic voltage sensitivity: Implications on the mechanism of linoleic acid action,19535910,10.4161/chan.3.3.8873,"Open channel block (OCB) is a process by which ions bind to the inside of a channel pore and block the flow of ions through that channel. Repulsion of the blocking ions by membrane depolarization is a known mechanism for open channel block removal. For the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) channel, this mechanism is necessary for channel activation and is involved in neuronal plasticity. Several types of Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) channels, including the Drosophila TRP and TRP-Like (TRPL) channels, also exhibit open channel block. For the Drosophila TRP and TRPL channels, removal of open channel block is necessary for the production of the physiological response to light. Recently, we have shown that lipids such as polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), represented by linoleic acid (LA), alleviate OCB under physiological conditions, from the Drosophila TRP and TRPL channels and from the mammalian NMDA channel. Here we show that OCB removal by LA is not confined to the Drosophila TRPs but also applies to mammalian TRPs such as the heat activated TRPV3 channel. TRPV3 shows OCB alleviation by LA, although it shares little amino acid sequence homology with the Drosophila TRPs. Strikingly, LA inhibits the heat-activated TRPV1 and the cold temperature-activated TRPM8 channels, which are intrinsic voltage sensitive channels and do not show OCB. Together, our findings further support the notion that lipids do not act as second messengers by direct binding to a specific site of the channels but rather act indirectly by affecting the channel-plasma membrane interface.",2009,"Baruch Minke, Moshe Parnas, Maximilian Peters"

Two alterations, a point mutation in intron 7 and an insertion in intron 10, lead to premature truncation of the PATCHED protein. Another point mutation in intron 17 results in the skipping of exon 18 and the subsequent in-frame deletion of 46 amino acids. Additionally, in all lymphocyte and keratinocyte cell lines examined, exon 10 of PTCH is alternatively spliced leading to an in-frame deletion of 52 amino acids.",1998,"G Chenevix-Trench, C Wicking, I Smyth, B Wainwright"
Identification of xanthurenic acid as the putative inducer of malaria development in the mosquito,9521324,10.1038/32667,"Malaria is transmitted from vertebrate host to mosquito vector by mature sexual blood-living stages called gametocytes. Within seconds of ingestion into the mosquito bloodmeal, gametocytes undergo gametogenesis. Induction requires the simultaneous exposure to at least two stimuli in vitro: a drop in bloodmeal temperature to 5 degrees C below that of the vertebrate host, and a rise in pH from 7.4 to 8.0-8.2. In vivo the mosquito bloodmeal has a pH of between 7.5 and 7.6. It is thought that in vivo the second inducer is an unknown mosquito-derived gametocyte-activating factor. Here we show that this factor is xanthurenic acid. We also show that low concentrations of xanthurenic acid can act together with pH to induce gametogenesis in vitro. Structurally related compounds are at least ninefold less effective at inducing gametogenesis in vitro. In Drosophila mutants with lesions in the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism (of which xanthurenic acid is a side product), no alternative active compound was detected in crude insect homogenates. These data could form the basis of the rational development of new methods of interrupting the transmission of malaria using drugs or new refractory mosquito genotypes to block parasite gametogenesis.",1998,"M Panico, M Rogers, A E Etienne, R E Sinden, A Dell, H R Morris, O Billker, V Lindo, T Paxton"

We earlier isolated a cDNA encoding a novel human protein kinase Aik which shares high amino acid identity with the Aurora/Ipl1 protein kinase family. In the present study, a second human cDNA highly homologous to aurora/IPL1 (Aik2) was identified and the nucleotide sequence was determined (gene symbol STK12). The C-terminal kinase domain of the STK12 encoded protein shares high amino acid sequence identity with those of mouse STK-1 (90%), rat AIM-1 (90%), human Aik (69%), mouse IAK1/Ayk1 (69%), Xenopus pEg2 (68%), Drosophila Aurora (62%), and yeast Ipl1 (45%), whereas the N-terminal domain of the STK12 protein shares little homology with those of Aurora/Ipl1 family members except for AIM-1 and STK-1.

Study of subcellular localization of membrane-bound choline acetyltransferase in Drosophila central nervous system and its association with membranes,9751137,10.1046/j.1460-9568.1998.00177.x,"Choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), the enzyme which catalyses the biosynthesis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, exists in a soluble and membrane-bound form in cholinergic nerve terminals of different animal species. This study was performed on the enzyme present in Drosophila central nervous system. We show that the two forms of the enzyme have the same apparent molecular weight (75 kDa) when analysed by immunoblotting using an antibody we raised against the recombinant enzyme. According to different authors, membrane-bound enzyme might be associated with synaptic vesicles or plasma membrane. Subfractionation of Drosophila head homogenates in linear glycerol gradients showed that ChAT does not associate with synaptic vesicles. Analysis of ChAT activity and immunoreactivity showed that two peaks of ChAT were produced. One peak was present in fractions containing soluble components and the other was associated with rapidly sedimenting membranes containing plasma membranes. ChAT in the first peak was mainly hydrophilic. A large proportion of ChAT associated with rapidly sedimenting membranes was amphiphilic. Further fractionation of these membranes by flotation in sucrose gradients showed that membrane-associated ChAT sedimented in fractions containing plasma membrane marker. Membrane-bound ChAT was neither solubilized nor converted to hydrophilic enzyme after membrane treatment with 1 M hydroxylamine, suggesting that the enzyme is not palmitoylated and therefore not anchored to membrane through thioester-linked long chain fatty acid. Partial solubilization of ChAT present on membranes with urea and carbonate suggests that this form of ChAT is a peripheral membrane protein.

Although ryk RNA is expressed at similar levels in a variety of tissues from embryonic day 10.5 to 18.5, specific induction of ryk RNA can be seen by in situ hybridization in the basal layer of skin and hair follicle at day 15.5-16.5, and protein staining localizes to the hair follicle by immunohistochemistry. At day 4.5 and 6.5, little if any ryk is present in the blastocyst, but it is transiently induced at a high level in mature decidual cells of the uterine stroma. We review a number of independent isolations of ryk, including fruit fly and nematode members of the ryk family. Because ryk is induced in epithelial cells seeking a final place in a differentiated tissue, or during remodeling of the endometrium, and a homologous gene, derailed, is known to regulate muscle and nerve target seeking in Drosophila, ryk may also be involved in cellular recognition of appropriate context.",1998,"A L Tyner, M S Serfas"
Capsulin: a novel bHLH transcription factor expressed in epicardial progenitors and mesenchyme of visceral organs,9545521,10.1016/s0925-4773(98)00030-6,"Members of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family of transcription factors have been shown to control development and differentiation of a variety of cell types.

Capsulin transcripts also mark the spiral septum of the heart and progenitor cells that give rise to the pericardium and coronary arteries. Capsulin shares high homology with a recently identified bHLH protein from Drosophila, called bHLH102C, which is expressed in visceral muscle cells that surround the midgut. Capsulin binds a specific E-box consensus sequence (CANNTG) as a heterodimer with the widely-expressed bHLH protein E12, but it does not activate transcription through that sequence on its own. Its restricted expression pattern and DNA binding activity suggest that capsulin regulates gene expression in specific subtypes of visceral mesodermal cells involved in organogenesis and in precursor cells that contribute to the pericardium, coronary arteries and regions of the heart.",1998,"J A Richardson, J Lu, E N Olson"

Comparison with Meis1 finds two regions of high homology: a novel MH domain and the homeodomain. In imaginal discs, hth expression coincides with nuclear Exd. hth and exd also have virtually identical, mutant clonal phenotypes in adults. These results suggest that hth and exd function in the same pathway. We show that hth acts upstream of exd and is required and sufficient for Exd protein nuclear localization. We also show that hth and exd are both negative regulators of eye development; their mutant clones caused ectopic eye formation. Targeted expression of hth, but not of exd, in the eye disc abolished eye development completely.

Trunk-specific modulation of wingless signalling in Drosophila by teashirt binding to armadillo,9707400,10.1016/s0960-9822(07)00369-7,"Background: One function of the Wingless signal cascade is to determine the 'naked' cuticle cell-fate choice instead of the denticled one in Drosophila larvae. Wingless stabilises cytoplasmic Armadillo, which may act in a transcriptional activator complex with the DNA-binding protein T-cell factor (also known as Pangolin). As these components are critical for all Wingless-dependent patterning events, the problem arises as to how specific outputs are achieved. Results: The Teashirt zinc finger protein was found to be necessary for a subset of late Wingless-dependent functions in the embryonic trunk segments where the teashirt gene is expressed. Teashirt was found to be required for the maintenance of the late Wingless signalling target gene wingless but not for an earlier one, engrailed. Armadillo and Teashirt proteins showed similar Wingless-dependent modulation patterns in homologous parts of each trunk segment in embryos, with high levels of nuclear Teashirt and intracellular Armadillo within cells destined to form naked cuticle. We found that Teashirt associates with, and requires, Armadillo in a complex for its function. Conclusions: Teashirt binds to, and requires, Armadillo for the naked cell-fate choice in the larval trunk. Teashirt is required for trunk segment identity, suggesting that Teashirt provides a region-specific output to Armadillo activity. Further modulation of Wingless is achieved in homologous parts of each trunk segment where Wingless and Teashirt are especially active. Our results provide a novel, cell-intrinsic mechanism to explain the modulation of the activity of the Wingless signalling pathway.",1998,"B Charroux, A Erkner, A Gallet, S Kerridge, L Fasano"
Genetic dissection of functional contributions of specific potassium channel subunits in habituation of an escape circuit in Drosophila,9482810,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.18-06-02254.1998,"Potassium channels have been implicated in central roles in activity-dependent neural plasticity. The giant fiber escape pathway of Drosophila has been established as a model for analyzing habituation and its modification by memory mutations in an identified circuit. Several genes in Drosophila encoding K+ channel subunits have been characterized, permitting examination of the contributions of specific channel subunits to simple conditioning in an identified circuit that is amenable to genetic analysis. Our results show that mutations altering each of four K+ channel subunits (Sh, slo, eag, and Hk) have distinct effects on habituation at least as strong as those of dunce and rutabaga, memory mutants with defective cAMP metabolism (). Habituation, spontaneous recovery, and dishabituation of the electrically stimulated long-latency giant fiber pathway response were shown in each mutant type. Mutations of Sh (voltage-gated) and slo (Ca2+-gated) subunits enhanced and slowed habituation, respectively. However, mutations of eag and Hk subunits, which confer K+-current modulation, had even more extreme phenotypes, again enhancing and slowing habituation, respectively. In double mutants, Sh mutations moderated the strong phenotypes of eag and Hk, suggesting that their modulatory functions are best expressed in the presence of intact Sh subunits. Nonactivity-dependent responses (refractory period and latency) at two stages of the circuit were altered only in some mutants and do not account for modifications of habituation. Furthermore, failures of the long-latency response during habituation, which normally occur in labile connections in the brain, could be induced in the thoracic circuit stage in Hk mutants. Our work indicates that different K+ channel subunits play distinct roles in activity-dependent neural plasticity and thus can be incorporated along with second messenger ""memory"" loci to enrich the genetic analysis of learning and memory.",1998,"C F Wu, J E Engel"

The analysis of the patterns of developmental expression of the 8 distinct genes at this site showed that all but two were expressed during larval life. The patterns fell into three groups: one where expression was all through larval life, one where expression was primarily in the third instar, and one only during the production of the adult cuticle. One duplicated gene was not expressed in the Canton S strain at any time from the embryo to adult ecdysis.

Disabled is a putative adaptor protein that functions during signaling by the sevenless receptor tyrosine kinase,9671493,10.1128/mcb.18.8.4844,"DRK, the Drosophila homolog of the SH2-SH3 domain adaptor protein Grb2, is required during signaling by the sevenless receptor tyrosine kinase (SEV). One role of DRK is to provide a link between activated SEV and the Ras1 activator SOS. We have investigated the possibility that DRK performs other functions by identifying additional DRK-binding proteins. We show that the phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain-containing protein Disabled (DAB) binds to the DRK SH3 domains. DAB is expressed in the ommatidial clusters, and loss of DAB function disrupts ommatidial development. Moreover, reduction of DAB function attenuates signaling by a constitutively activated SEV. Our biochemical analysis suggests that DAB binds SEV directly via its PTB domain, becomes tyrosine phosphorylated upon SEV activation, and then serves as an adaptor protein for SH2 domain-containing proteins. Taken together, these results indicate that DAB is a novel component of the SEV signaling pathway.",1998,"N Le, M A Simon"

The results indicate for EO mutation induction at doses 500-fold below the LD50. In crosses of mutagenized NER+ males with NER+ females, the 500-fold increase in EO dose from 47 ppm h to 24,000 ppm h resulted in no more than a 17-fold enhanced mutant frequency in spermatozoa. This flat dose-response relationship is primarily the result of efficient repair of EO-induced DNA adducts in the fertilized egg, as was evident from the up to 40-fold or 240-fold increased mutant frequencies above NER- or NER+ background levels, respectively, in crosses with NER- females. With decreasing dose, MNER-/MNER+ ratios decreased from 9 to 14 at high doses down to approximately 1 at the two lowest doses, indicating that a small fraction of premutagenic lesions induced by EO cannot be repaired by the NER system of Drosophila. Linear extrapolation from high to low EO exposure led to an underestimation of the mutation frequency actually observed at low doses. The pattern of EO-induced ring chromosome loss (CL) differed in two respects from that observed for forward mutations: (a) an increase in CL frequencies was observed only at the two highest EO exposure levels, and (b) inactivation of the NER pathway by the mus201 mutant had no measurable effect on the occurrence of CL. The absence of a potentiating effect of mus201 on EO-induced clastogenicity suggests the formation of clastogenic DNA lesions not causing point mutations, and which are not repaired by NER. Consistent with an inversed correlation of reactivities towards N7-guanine and chain length of 1,2-alkyl-epoxides, the relative mutagenic efficiencies of EO:PO:BO are 100:7.2:1.8 for the NER+ groups, and 100:20:0.7 in the absence of NER. Although in Drosophila germ cells EO is also more effective as a clastogen than PO, the difference (EO:PO=100:58) is much smaller than for recessive mutations. These results provide another argument that DNA lesions generating base substitutions as opposed to those causing clastogenic damage may not be the same for these agents.",1998,"E W Vogel, M J Nivard"
Axial specification for sensory organs versus non-sensory structures of the chicken inner ear,9389659,,"A mature inner ear is a complex labyrinth containing multiple sensory organs and nonsensory structures in a fixed configuration.

Therefore, it is important to understand molecularly how and when the position of each inner ear component is determined during development. To address this issue, each axis of the otocyst (embryonic day 2.5, E2.5, stage 16-17) was changed systematically at an age when axial information of the inner ear is predicted to be fixed based on gene expression patterns. Transplanted inner ears were analyzed at E4.5 for gene expression of BMP4 (bone morphogenetic protein), SOHo-1 (sensory organ homeobox-1), Otx1 (cognate of Drosophila orthodenticle gene), p75NGFR (nerve growth factor receptor) and Msx1 (muscle segment homeobox), or at E9 for their gross anatomy and sensory organ formation. Our results showed that axial specification in the chick inner ear occurs later than expected and patterning of sensory organs in the inner ear was first specified along the anterior/posterior (A/P) axis, followed by the dorsal/ventral (D/V) axis. Whereas the A/P axis of the sensory organs was fixed at the time of transplantation, the A/P axis for most non-sensory structures was not and was able to be re-specified according to the new axial information from the host. The D/V axis for the inner ear was not fixed at the time of transplantation. The asynchronous specification of the A/P and D/V axes of the chick inner ear suggests that sensory organ formation is a multi-step phenomenon, rather than a single inductive event.",1998,"D K Wu, D Choo, F D Nunes"
Two distantly positioned PDZ domains mediate multivalent INAD-phospholipase C interactions essential for G protein-coupled signaling,9545241,10.1093/emboj/17.8.2285,"Drosophila INAD, which contains five tandem protein interaction PDZ domains, plays an important role in the G protein-coupled visual signal transduction. Mutations in InaD alleles display mislocalization of signaling molecules of phototransduction which include the essential effector, phospholipase C-beta (PLC-beta), which is also known as NORPA. The molecular and biochemical details of this functional link are unknown. We report that INAD directly binds to NORPA via two terminally positioned PDZ1 and PDZ5 domains. PDZ1 binds to the C-terminus of NORPA, while PDZ5 binds to an internal region overlapping with the G box-homology region (a putative G protein-interacting site). The NORPA proteins lacking binding sites, which display normal basal PLC activity, can no longer associate with INAD in vivo. These truncations cause significant reduction of NORPA protein expression in rhabdomeres and severe defects in phototransduction. Thus, the two terminal PDZ domains of INAD, through intermolecular and/or intramolecular interactions, are brought into proximity in vivo. Such domain organization allows for the multivalent INAD-NORPA interactions which are essential for G protein-coupled phototransduction.",1998,"R van Huizen, D M Chen, R W Raab, Y Li, Z C Lai, K Miller, R D Shortridge, M Li, W S Stark"
Combinatorial expression patterns of individual TLE proteins during cell determination and differentiation suggest non-redundant functions for mammalian homologs of Drosophila Groucho,9572356,10.1046/j.1440-169x.1998.00003.x,"The Drosophila protein Groucho is involved in the regulation of cell-determination events during insect neurogenesis and segmentation. A group of mammalian proteins, referred to as transducin-like Enhancer of split (TLE) 1 through 4, share with Groucho identical structures and molecular properties. The aim was to determine whether individual TLE proteins participate in the regulation of cell determination in mammals like their Drosophila counterpart. It is here reported that TLE family members are expressed in combinatorial ways during the in vitro differentiation of mouse P19 embryonic carcinoma cells (a model for neural determination) and rat CFK2 cells (a model for chondrocytic determination). TLE1 is up-regulated and TLE2 and TLE4 are down-regulated to different extents during early stages of differentiation. In contrast, later stages correlate with up-regulation of TLE2 and TLE4, and decreased expression of TLE1. Individual TLE proteins are also expressed in combinatorial as well as complementary patterns during the development of the cerebral cortex and spinal cord of mouse embryos. In particular, TLE1 is robustly expressed in both neural progenitor cells and postmitotic neurons of the outer layers of the cortical plate, whereas TLE4 expression marks preferentially postmitotic neurons of the inner layers. Taken together, these results strongly suggest non-redundant roles for individual TLE proteins during both cell-determination and cell-differentiation events.",1998,"J Henderson, Y Liu, J Yao, R Lo, A Palaparti, J Husain, S Stifani"
The Caenorhabditis elegans unc-64 locus encodes a syntaxin that interacts genetically with synaptobrevin,9614171,10.1091/mbc.9.6.1235,"We describe the molecular cloning and characterization of the unc-64 locus of Caenorhabditis elegans. unc-64 expresses three transcripts, each encoding a molecule with 63-64% identity to human syntaxin 1A, a membrane- anchored protein involved in synaptic vesicle fusion. Interestingly, the alternative forms of syntaxin differ only in their C-terminal hydrophobic membrane anchors. The forms are differentially expressed in neuronal and secretory tissues; genetic evidence suggests that these forms are not functionally equivalent. A complete loss-of-function mutation in unc-64 results in a worm that completes embryogenesis, but arrests development shortly thereafter as a paralyzed L1 larva, presumably as a consequence of neuronal dysfunction. The severity of the neuronal phenotypes of C. elegans syntaxin mutants appears comparable to those of Drosophila syntaxin mutants. However, nematode syntaxin appears not to be required for embryonic development, for secretion of cuticle from the hypodermis, or for the function of muscle, in contrast to Drosophila syntaxin, which appears to be required in all cells. Less severe viable unc-64 mutants exhibit a variety of behavioral defects and show strong resistance to the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor aldicarb. Extracellular physiological recordings from pharyngeal muscle of hypomorphic mutants show alterations in the kinetics of transmitter release. The lesions in the hypomorphic alleles map to the hydrophobic face of the H3 coiled-coil domain of syntaxin, a domain that in vitro mediates physical interactions with similar coiled-coil domains in SNAP-25 and synaptobrevin. Furthermore, the unc-64 syntaxin mutants exhibit allele-specific genetic interactions with mutants carrying lesions in the coiled-coil domain of synaptobrevin, providing in vivo evidence for the significance of these domains in regulating synaptic vesicle fusion.",1998,"M L Nonet, O Saifee, L Wei"
Nucleotide sequence of murine PCNA: interspecies comparison of the cDNA and the 5' flanking region of the gene,1726365,10.3109/10425179109039688,"Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) RNA levels are regulated by transcription as well as changes in stability, in growing cells.

Comparison of the murine deduced amino acid sequence with the PCNA sequence from rat, human, Drosophila, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and higher plants, reveals extensive homology between species. The homology is likely to be related to the fundamental role of PCNA as an auxiliary protein for DNA replication. Consensus sequences for transcriptional regulatory factors identified within 520 bp 5' of the cap site of the murine PCNA gene include: an inverted CCAAT site, an enhancer core element (EBP-1), three cAMP-response elements (CRE-BP), one AP-2 site, three Sp1 sites, and two octamer sequences. The first 20 bp of the transcriptional unit are homologous to an initiator element, which may direct transcription from RNA polymerase II in the absence of a TATAA box.

Effect of heat shock on gene expression of Aedes albopictus cells infected with Mayaro virus,1711236,10.1016/0923-2516(91)90024-w,"Three major Mayaro virus proteins of 62, 50 and 34 kDa were detected in Aedes albopictus cells after 48 h postinfection at 28 degrees C. When the infected cells were shifted from 28 to 37 degrees C for 90 min (heat shock conditions), the synthesis of two major heat shock proteins (HSP) 82 and 70 kDa was induced concomitantly with strong inhibition of virus and normal protein synthesis. Total cellular RNA was isolated from mock and infected cells incubated at 28 degrees C or under heat shock. Northern blot analysis with HSP genomic probes from Drosophila sp showed that (1) the probe for HSP 82 hybridized with an RNA of 2.6 kb present only in heat-shocked cells, (2) the HSP 70 probe hybridized with RNA species of 2.5 kb, present only in RNA from heat-shocked cells.

We have cloned the tld locus by P element tagging. At the blastoderm stage, tld RNA is expressed dorsally, similar to that described for dpp. Analysis of a tld cDNA reveals three sequence motifs: an N terminal region of similarity to a metalloprotease, two EGF-like repeats, and five copies of a repeat found in human complement proteins C1r and C1s. tld sequence is 41% identical to human bone morphogenetic protein 1 (BMP-1); the closest members to dpp within the TGF-beta superfamily are BMP-2 and BMP-4, two other bone morphogenetic proteins.

Subfreezing volumetric behavior and stochastic modeling of intracellular ice formation in Drosophila melanogaster embryos,1901783,10.1016/0011-2240(91)90009-d,"Cryomicroscopic observations were made of the volumetric behavior and kinetics of intracellular ice formation (IIF) in Drosophila melanogaster embryos in a modified cell culture medium (BD.20) or BD.20 + 2 M ethylene glycol. After rapid cooling to a given temperature, transient volumetric contraction of the embryos during the isothermal period was quantified by computerized video image analysis. Fitting these data to the numerical solution of the volume flux equation yielded estimates of the hydraulic permeability coefficient (Lp) for individual embryos at various subfreezing temperatures. Lp approximately followed an Arrhenius relation between -2 and -9 degrees C, with a value of 0.168 microns/(min-atm) extrapolated to 0 degrees C and an apparent activation energy delta E of 38.9 kcal/mol. IIF during an isothermal period occurred at random times whose characteristic temperature range and kinetics were affected by the presence of ethylene glycol. A stochastic process model developed to fit these data indicated the influence of both time-dependent and instantaneous components of IIF, presumed to be the result of seeding and heterogeneous nucleation, respectively. The presence of 2 M ethylene glycol depressed the characteristic temperature of instantaneous IIF by about 12 degrees C and reduced the rate constant for time-dependent IIF. Comparison with observed incidences of IIF yielded an estimate of the supercooling tolerance of 3 to 5 degrees C.",1991,"S P Myers, R E Pitt, P L Steponkus, T T Lin"
The maternal store of zinc finger protein encoding mRNAs in fully grown Xenopus oocytes is not required for early embryogenesis,2026142,,"A large family of C2H2 (Krüppel-like) zinc finger protein genes is maternally transcribed in Xenopus oocytes; many of the corresponding mRNAs are actively translated post-fertilization, before the onset of zygotic activation of transcription. With the aim of asking if any of these stored mRNAs have a function in Xenopus development, we made use of antisense oligonucleotide mediated, targeted RNA destruction. Injected oocytes lose the entire pool of C2H2 zinc finger protein encoding mRNAs. They are indistinguishable from control oocytes in their abilities to mature in vitro and to be fertilized in vitro. Embryos generated from such oocytes develop normally until tadpole stage. These findings do not rule out the possibility that C2H2 zinc finger protein genes are involved in developmental control in Xenopus. However, they do suggest that the biological function for at least some of the early expressed zinc finger proteins in Xenopus differs in important aspects from the way Krüppel or other DNA binding factors act as developmental regulators in Drosophila.",1991,"T el-Baradi, T Bouwmeester, R Giltay, T Pieler"
The paired box encodes a second DNA-binding domain in the paired homeo domain protein,1672661,10.1101/gad.5.4.594,"The homeo box, which encodes the DNA-binding homeo domain, is a DNA sequence motif present in several Drosophila developmental genes; it has been used to identify many homologous genes involved in mammalian development. The paired box is another conserved sequence motif, first identified in the paired (prd) and gooseberry (gsb) Drosophila homeo domain genes. It encodes a 128-amino-acid domain, the paired domain, which has since been found in other fly and mouse gene products, in association with the homeo domain or in its absence. We show that the paired box of the prd gene encodes a DNA-binding activity, independent of the DNA-binding activity of the Paired (Prd) homeo domain and with a different sequence specificity. The amino-terminal region of the paired domain, including one of the three predicted alpha-helices, is necessary and sufficient for binding. We investigate the binding of the Prd protein to two sites in the even-skipped promoter, which are composed of overlapping sequences bound by the homeo domain and by the paired domain. We also show that a mutation in the paired box of Prd, corresponding to the mutation in the paired box of the mouse Pax-1 gene thought to cause the undulated skeletal phenotype, destroys the ability of the Prd protein to bind to the paired domain-specific site. This supports the view that the undulated phenotype results from the inactivation of the DNA-binding activity of the paired domain of Pax-1.",1991,"E Harris, C Desplan, J Treisman"
A Drosophila mutant defective in extracellular calcium-dependent photoreceptor deactivation and rapid desensitization,1961249,10.1038/354230a0,"CALCIUM is involved in the adaptation of vertebrate photoreceptors to light and may have a similar role in invertebrate phototransduction. But the molecular mechanisms mediating this stimulus-dependent regulation are not well understood in any G protein-coupled transduction system. We have developed a preparation of isolated Drosophila photoreceptors that has allowed us to carry out an electrophysiological characterization of the light-activated response in these sensory neurons using patch-clamp techniques. We report here that extracellular calcium entering through the light-activated conductance is a key regulator of both the activation and deactivation phases of the phototransduction cascade, and that inaC mutant photoreceptors are specifically defective in the calcium-dependent deactivation mechanism. These data suggest that the light-dependent calcium influx inactivates this cascade through a biochemical pathway that requires the inaC gene product, and that this mechanism represents a molecular basis for stimulus-dependent regulation of visual transduction in Drosophila photoreceptors.",1991,"C S Zuker, R Ranganathan, C F Stevens, G L Harris"
Analysis of sequences regulating larval expression of the Adh gene of Drosophila melanogaster,1752419,,"The effects of a series of eight, 50 base pair internal deletions in the 5' region upstream of the proximal transcription start site of the Adh gene of Drosophila melanogaster were examined in a quantitative assay. Mixtures of two plasmids, one bearing a deleted gene, the other with an intact reference gene, were injected into alcohol dehydrogenase-negative embryos. Third instar larvae of the injected generation were assayed for relative alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme activity. Quantitative analysis of the eight deletions indicated that two regions were required for any detectable enzyme activity and one region was required for appropriate tissue specificity. The remaining five deletions significantly decreased, but did not eliminate activity. When the deleted genes were placed on a plasmid with an intact reference gene, activities of all but one deletion were restored to levels equivalent to that of the intact reference gene (regardless of orientation). This restoration of activity did not occur when the regulatory region of the intact gene was replaced with the Hsp70 heat shock promoter nor when the 50-base pair deletion encompassed the region that includes the TATA sequence. The fact that seven of the eight deleted genes express activity in the presence of a reference gene on the same plasmid suggests that the deleted gene is controlled by regulatory elements in the reference gene. Further, these regulatory elements exhibit no preference for their own, more proximate, promoter.",1991,"P F Martin, E C Hotaling, N L Shen, W Sofer, G Subrahmanyam"

"Elements of the fruitless locus regulate development of the muscle of Lawrence, a male-specific structure in the abdomen of Drosophila melanogaster adults",1821857,,"A genetically defined element of the fruitless (fru) locus in Drosophila melanogaster regulates the development of a male-specific muscle spanning the fifth abdominal segment in adult males, the 'muscle of Lawrence' (MOL). The region is defined by two cytological deletions, each with a breakpoint that co-maps with previously described mutant courtship phenotypes at cytogenetic interval 91B on the third chromosome. Flies that carry both of these deletions are viable, and males express abnormalities of courtship similar to those caused by the fru inversion breakpoint at 91B. In addition, these double-deletion males show the complete absence of the MOL, suggesting that they have little or no gene expression of a postulated MOL determinant; the musculature in the fifth abdominal segment of these mutants to indistinguishable from that of a normal female. Other mutant combinations that produce fruitless courtship phenotypes--including deletion and inversion breakpoints, and a marked transposon inserted at 91B--produce intermediate forms of the MOL. A new genetic variant, induced by imprecise excision of the marked transposon, is homozygous lethal and disrupts fru functions related to courtship and the MOL. The MOL is shown to be dispensable for fertility and is therefore not the causative factor of fru-induced behavioral sterility. These genetic variants and their phenotypic results are discussed with regard to a model for the organization of the fru locus.",1991,"J C Hall, D A Gailey, B J Taylor"

Sex-specific transcriptional regulation of the C. elegans sex-determining gene her-1,1716965,10.1016/0925-4773(91)90090-s,"Expression of the sex-determining gene her-1 is required in C. elegans for the normal male development of XO animals. Abnormal expression in XX animals, which normally develop as hermaphrodites, results in aberrant male development. We have isolated a molecular clone of the her-1 gene and have identified two transcripts that are present in XO animals at all stages of development: an abundant 0.8 kb transcript and a less abundant 1.2 kb transcript. In preparations of XX animals, the 0.8 kb transcript was observed only at very low levels in embryos or L1 larvae and the 1.2 kb transcript was not detected. Two gain-of-function her-1 mutations result in high levels of the 1.2 and 0.8 kb transcripts in XX animals. The levels of these transcripts are also elevated in XX animals carrying a loss-of-function mutation in either sdc-1 or sdc-2, consistent with the proposed roles of these genes as negative regulators of her-1. These results demonstrate that expression of the her-1 gene in males and hermaphrodites is controlled at the level of transcript synthesis or accumulation. This mode of regulation contrasts with that found for the Drosophila sex-determining genes, whose sex-specific expression is controlled by differential splicing in males and females.",1991,"B Purnell, C Trent, S Gavinski, C Chamblin, J Hageman, W B Wood"

Expression of ion channels and mutational effects in giant Drosophila neurons differentiated from cell division-arrested embryonic neuroblasts,1712379,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.11-07-02135.1991,"A culture system of ""giant"" Drosophila neurons derived from cytokinesis-arrested embryonic neuroblasts was developed to overcome the technical difficulties usually encountered in studying small Drosophila neurons. Cytochalasin B-treated neuroblasts differentiated into giant multinucleated cells that displayed neuronal morphology and neuron-specific markers (Wu et al., 1990). Here, we report that these giant neurons express different excitability patterns and membrane channels similar to those reported in excitable tissues of Drosophila. Individual neurons exhibited distinct all-or-none or graded voltage responses upon current injection. Both current- and voltage-clamp recordings could be performed on the same neuron because of the large cell size, thus making it possible to elucidate the functional role of the individual types of channels. By using pharmacological agents and ion substitution, the following currents were identified in these giant neurons: inward Na+ and Ca2+ currents and outward voltage-activated (the A-type and delayed rectifier) and Ca(2+)-activated K+ currents. In addition, we found a tetrodotoxin (TTX)-sensitive, Na(+)-dependent outward K+ current and a persistent component of an inward Na+ current, which have not been reported in Drosophila previously. This culture system can be used to analyze the mutational perturbations in ion channels and the resultant alterations in membrane excitability. Neurons from the mutant slowpoke (slo), which is known to lack a component of the Ca(2+)-activated K+ currents in muscles, exhibited prolonged action potentials associated with defects in the Ca(2+)-activated K+ current.

The insertion patterns were analyzed in progenies of the treated flies, either on larvae by in situ hybridization of giant salivary gland chromosomes, or on adult flies by Southern blotting interpreted by densitometric analysis. The techniques used made it possible to detect only changes with frequencies of more than 10% of the insertion sites. We show that the copia and mdg-1 elements cannot be radically mobilized in our inbred lines under the stressful conditions used.

The polarity of the dorsoventral axis in the Drosophila embryo is defined by an extracellular signal,1904007,10.1016/0092-8674(91)90381-8,"Twelve maternal effect loci are required for the production of Drosophila embryos with a correct dorsoventral axis. Analysis of mosaic females indicates that the expression of the genes nudel, pipe, and windbeutel is required in the somatic tissue, presumably in the follicle cells that surround the oocyte. Thus, information coming from outside the egg cell influences dorsoventral pattern formation during embryogenesis. In transplantation experiments, the perivitelline fluid from the compartment surrounding the embryo can restore dorsoventral pattern to embryos from females mutant for nudel, pipe, or windbeutel. The positioning of the transplanted pervitelline fluid also determines the polarity of the restored dorsoventral axis. We propose that the polarizing activity, normally present at the ventral side of the egg, is a ligand for the Toll receptor. Presumably, local activation of the Toll protein by the ligand initiates the formation of the nuclear concentration gradient of the dorsal protein, thereby determining dorsoventral pattern.",1991,"E Vogelsang, S Roth, C Nüsslein-Volhard, D Stein"

Two metal-binding peptides from the insect Orchesella cincta (Collembola) as a result of metallothionein cleavage,11520689,10.1016/s0965-1748(01)00058-3,"Metallothionein (MT) is an ubiquitous heavy metal-binding protein which has been identified in animals, plants, protists, fungi and bacteria. In insects, primary structures of MTs are known only for Drosophila and the collembolan, Orchesella cincta. The MT cDNA from O. cincta encodes a 77 amino acid protein with 19 cysteines. Isolations of the protein itself have demonstrated the presence of two smaller metal-binding peptides, whose amino acid sequences correspond to parts of the cDNA, and which apparently result from cleavage of the native protein. The present study was undertaken to complete the picture of cleavage sites within the MT protein by applying protein isolation techniques in combination with mass spectrometry and N-terminal sequence analysis. Further, recombinant expression allowed us to study the intrinsic stability of the MT and to perform in vitro cleavage studies. The results show that the MT from O. cincta is specifically cleaved at two sites, both after the amino acid sequence Thr-Gln (TQ). One of these sites is located in the N-terminal region and the other in the linker region between two putative metal-binding clusters. When expressed in Escherichia coli, the recombinant O. cincta MT can be isolated in an uncleaved form; however, this protein can be cleaved in vitro by the proteolytic activity of O. cincta.

The RNA-binding protein Tsunagi interacts with Mago Nashi to establish polarity and localize oskar mRNA during Drosophila oogenesis,11691839,10.1101/gad.927001,"In Drosophila melanogaster, formation of the axes and the primordial germ cells is regulated by interactions between the germ line-derived oocyte and the surrounding somatic follicle cells. This reciprocal signaling results in the asymmetric localization of mRNAs and proteins critical for these oogenic processes. Mago Nashi protein interprets the posterior follicle cell-to-oocyte signal to establish the major axes and to determine the fate of the primordial germ cells. Using the yeast two-hybrid system we have identified an RNA-binding protein, Tsunagi, that interacts with Mago Nashi protein. The proteins coimmunoprecipitate and colocalize, indicating that they form a complex in vivo. Immunolocalization reveals that Tsunagi protein is localized within the posterior oocyte cytoplasm during stages 1-5 and 8-9, and that this localization is dependent on wild-type mago nashi function. When tsunagi function is removed from the germ line, egg chambers develop in which the oocyte nucleus fails to migrate, oskar mRNA is not localized within the posterior pole, and dorsal-ventral pattern abnormalities are observed. These results show that a Mago Nashi-Tsunagi protein complex is required for interpreting the posterior follicle cell-to-oocyte signal to define the major body axes and to localize components necessary for determination of the primordial germ cells.",2001,"S E Mohr, R E Boswell, S T Dillon"

Sequential FISH analysis with rDNA genes and Ag-NOR banding in the lady beetle Olla v-nigrum (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae),12043703,10.1111/j.1601-5223.2001.00013.x,"We have characterized the meiosis of Olla v-nigrum by standard analysis, performed a NOR study using NOR banding, FISH of rDNA genes and sequential FISH/AgNOR analysis, and adapted the FISH methodology to Coccinellidae. The chromosome number determined at metaphase I was n = 9 + Xyp. At zygotene it was possible to identify the sex vesicle which presented a deeply stained heteropycnotic block. Chromosome X is much larger than the y and the two combine, forming a ""parachute"" in metaphase I. FISH analysis using a probe of rDNA genes 18S, 28S and 5.8S of D. melanogaster was used to map the genes in the sex vesicle. The NOR band showed high gene activity in this region. These results were confirmed using sequential FISH/Ag NOR analysis. The data obtained for Olla v-nigrum agree with the classical hypothesis raised to explain the type of sex chromosome association in a parachute format (Xyp) as being due to the presence of nucleolar material. The chromosome number and parachute configuration during metaphase I in this species agree with the basic karyotype of most Coleopterans. The major adaptation of the FISH method was the simultaneous denaturation and hybridization that permitted preservation of chromosome morphology, an essential factor when the chromosomes are small.",2001,"L A Campos, S G Pompolo, E M Maffei, E Petitpierre"
New reproductive anomalies in fruitless-mutant Drosophila males: extreme lengthening of mating durations and infertility correlated with defective serotonergic innervation of reproductive organs,11291102,10.1002/neu.1021,"Several features of male reproductive behavior are under the neural control of fruitless (fru) in Drosophila melanogaster. This gene is known to influence courtship steps prior to mating, due to the absence of attempted copulation in the behavioral repertoire of most types of fru-mutant males. However, certain combinations of fru mutations allow for fertility. By analyzing such matings and their consequences, we uncovered two striking defects: mating times up to four times the normal average duration of copulation; and frequent infertility, regardless of the time of mating by a given transheterozygous fru-mutant male. The lengthened copulation times may be connected with fru-induced defects in the formation of a male-specific abdominal muscle. Production of sperm and certain seminal fluid proteins are normal in these fru mutants. However, analysis of postmating qualities of females that copulated with transheterozygous mutants strongly implied defects in the ability of these males to transfer sperm and seminal fluids. Such abnormalities may be associated with certain serotonergic neurons in the abdominal ganglion in which production of 5HT is regulated by fru. These cells send processes to contractile muscles of the male's internal sex organs; such projection patterns are aberrant in the semifertile fru mutants. Therefore, the reproductive functions regulated by fruitless are expanded in their scope, encompassing not only the earliest stages of courtship behavior along with almost all subsequent steps in the behavioral sequence, but also more than one component of the culminating events.",2001,"J C Hall, G Lee, A Villella, B J Taylor"
DNA-binding activity and subunit interaction of the mariner transposase,11522826,10.1093/nar/29.17.3566,"Mos1 is a member of the mariner/Tc1 family of transposable elements originally identified in Drosophila mauritiana. It has 28 bp terminal inverted repeats and like other elements of this type it transposes by a cut and paste mechanism, inserts at TA dinucleotides and codes for a transposase. This is the only protein required for transposition in vitro. We have investigated the DNA binding properties of Mos1 transposase and the role of transposase-transposase interactions in transposition. Purified transposase recognises the terminal inverted repeats of Mos1 due to a DNA-binding domain in the N-terminal 120 amino acids. This requires a putative helix-turn-helix motif between residues 88 and 108. Binding is preferentially to the right hand end, which differs at four positions from the repeat at the left end. Cleavage of Mos1 by transposase is also preferentially at the right hand end. Wild-type transposase monomers interact with each other in a yeast two-hybrid assay and we have used this to isolate mutations resulting in reduced interaction. These mutations lie along the length of the protein, indicating that transposase-transposase interactions are not due to a single interaction domain. One such mutation which retains both DNA-binding and catalytic activity has greatly reduced ability to excise Mos1 from plasmid DNA through coordinate cleavage of the two ends and transposition in vitro is lowered to a level 20-fold below that of the wild-type. This suggests that transposase-transposase interaction is required to form a synaptic complex necessary for coordinate cleavage at the ends of Mos1 during transposition. This mutant enzyme allows insertion at dinucleotides other than TA, including sequences with GC base pairs. This is the first example of a mariner/Tc1 transposase with altered target specificity.",2001,"A Dawson, L Zhang, D J Finnegan"
Seven Wnt homologues in Drosophila: a case study of the developing tracheae,11717401,10.1073/pnas.251304398,"Sequencing of the Drosophila genome has revealed that there are ""silent"" homologues of many important genes-family members that were not detected by classic genetic approaches. Why have so many homologues been conserved during evolution? Perhaps each one has a different but important function in every system. Perhaps each one works independently in a different part of the body. Or, perhaps some are redundant. Here, we take one well known gene family and analyze how the individual members contribute to the making of one system, the tracheae. There are seven DWnt genes in the Drosophila genome, including wingless (wg). The wg gene helps to pattern the developing trachea but is not responsible for all Wnt functions there. We test each one of the seven DWnts in several ways and find evidence that wg and DWnt2 can function in the developing trachea: when both genes are removed together, the phenotype is identical or very similar to that observed when the Wnt pathway is shut down. DWnt2 is expressed near the tracheal cells in the embryo in a different pattern to wg but is also transduced through the canonical Wnt pathway. We find that the seven DWnt genes vary in their effectiveness in specific tissues, such as the tracheae, and, moreover, the epidermis and the tracheae respond to DWnt2 and Wg differently. We suggest that the main advantage of retaining a number of similar genes is that it allows more subtle forms of control and more flexibility during evolution.",2001,"P A Lawrence, M Llimargas"
Odor coding in the Drosophila antenna,11395013,10.1016/s0896-6273(01)00289-6,"Odor coding in the Drosophila antenna is examined by a functional analysis of individual olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) in vivo. Sixteen distinct classes of ORNs, each with a unique response spectrum to a panel of 47 diverse odors, are identified by extracellular recordings. ORNs exhibit multiple modes of response dynamics: an individual neuron can show either excitatory or inhibitory responses, and can exhibit different modes of termination kinetics, when stimulated with different odors. The 16 ORN classes are combined in stereotyped configurations within seven functional types of basiconic sensilla. One sensillum type contains four ORNs and the others contain two neurons, combined according to a strict pairing rule. We provide a functional map of ORNs, showing that each ORN class is restricted to a particular spatial domain on the antennal surface.",2001,"J R Carlson, M de Bruyne, K Foster"
Identification of a novel thioredoxin-related transmembrane protein,11152479,10.1074/jbc.M011037200,"We recently identified a series of transforming growth factor-beta-responsive genes in A549 human adenocarcinoma cell line by a gene trap screening method. Here we report the molecular cloning and characterization of one of these genes, designated TMX, that encodes a novel protein of 280 amino acid residues. The TMX protein possesses an N-terminal signal peptide followed by one thioredoxin (Trx)-like domain with a unique active site sequence, Cys-Pro-Ala-Cys, and a potential transmembrane domain. There are putative TMX homologs with identical active site sequences in the Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila genomes. Using recombinant proteins expressed in Escherichia coli, we demonstrated the activity of the Trx domain of TMX to cleave the interchain disulfide bridges in insulin in vitro. The TMX transcript is widely expressed in normal human tissues, and subcellular fractionation and immunostaining for an epitope-tagged TMX protein suggest that TMX is predominantly localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). When TMX was expressed in HEK293 cells, it significantly suppressed the apoptosis induced by brefeldin A, an inhibitor of ER-Golgi transport. This activity was abolished when two Cys residues in the active site sequence were mutated to Ser, suggesting that the Trx-like activity of TMX may help relieve ER stress caused by brefeldin A.",2001,"H Nakamura, Y Matsuo, N Akiyama, J Yodoi, S Kizaka-Kondoh, M Noda"

The classical view of genital disc development is that in each sex, dsx autonomously ""represses"" the development of the inappropriate genital primordium while allowing the development of the appropriate primordium. Instead, we show that dsx regulates the A/P organizer to control growth of each genital primordium, and then directs each genital primordium to differentiate defined adult structures in both sexes.",2001,"A E Christiansen, E L Keisman, B S Baker"

Dynamic expression of Drosophila TRAF1 during embryogenesis and larval development,11118894,10.1016/s0925-4773(00)00506-2,"TNF-receptor associated factors (TRAFs) comprise a family of adaptor proteins that act as downstream signal transducers of the TNF receptor superfamily and the Toll/interleukin-1 receptor family.

Delta expression in post-mitotic neurons identifies distinct subsets of adult-specific lineages in Drosophila,17443769,10.1002/dneu.20308,"The Drosophila ventral nerve cord is comprised of numerous neuronal lineages, each derived from a stereotypically positioned neuroblast (NB). At the embryonic stage the unique identities of each NB, and several of their neuronal progeny, are well characterized by spatial and temporal expression patterns of molecular markers. These patterns of expression are not preserved at the larval stage and thus the identity of adult-specific lineages remains obscure. Recent clonal analysis using MARCM has identified 24 adult-specific lineages arising from thoracic NBs at the larval stage. In this study, we have explored a role for the Delta protein in development of the post-embryonic Drosophila ventral nerve cord. We find that Delta expression identifies 7 of the 24 adult-specific lineages of the thoracic ganglia by being highly enriched in clusters of newly born post-mitotic neurons and their neurite bundles. The Delta lineages constitute the majority of bundles projecting to the ventral neuropil, consistent with a role in processing leg sensory information. Targeted knockdown of Delta in neurons using RNAi results in significantly decreased leg chemosensory response and a relatively unaffected leg mechanosensory response. Delta RNAi knockdown in Delta lineages also gives a more diffuse bundle terminal morphology while the overall path-finding of neurite bundles is unaffected. We also identify a male-specific Delta lineage in the terminal abdominal ganglia, implicating a role for Delta in development of sexually dimorphic neural networks. Examples of Delta-expressing neurites contacting Notch-expressing glia are also seen, but are not common to all Delta lineages. Altogether, these data reveal a fundamental pattern of Delta expression that is indicative of an underlying developmental program that confers identity to adult lineage neurons.",2007,"Carson Cornbrooks, Matthew D Rand, Darren W Williams, James W Truman, Christin Bland"

"Trace amines differentially regulate adult locomotor activity, cocaine sensitivity, and female fertility in Drosophila melanogaster",17638385,10.1002/dneu.20459,"The trace biogenic amines tyramine and octopamine are found in the nervous systems of animals ranging in complexity from nematodes to mammals. In insects such as Drosophila melanogaster, the trace amine octopamine is a well-established neuromodulator that mediates a diverse range of physiological processes, but an independent role for tyramine is less clear. Tyramine is synthesized from tyrosine by the enzyme tyrosine decarboxylase (TDC). We previously reported the identification of two Tdc genes in Drosophila: the peripherally-expressed Tdc1 and the neurally-expressed Tdc2. To further clarify the neural functions of the trace amines in Drosophila, we examined normal and cocaine-induced locomotor activity in flies that lack both neural tyramine and octopamine because of mutation in Tdc2 (Tdc2(RO54)). Tdc2(RO54) flies have dramatically reduced basal locomotor activity levels and are hypersensitive to an initial dose of cocaine. Tdc2-targeted expression of the constitutively active inward rectifying potassium channel Kir2.1 replicates these phenotypes, and Tdc2-driven expression of Tdc1 rescues the phenotypes. However, flies that contain no measurable neural octopamine and an excess of tyramine due to a null mutation in the tyramine beta-hydroxylase gene (TbetaH(nM18)) exhibit normal locomotor activity and cocaine responses in spite of showing female sterility due to loss of octopamine. The ability of elevated levels of neural tyramine in TbetaH(nM18) flies to supplant the role of octopamine in adult locomotor and cocaine-induced behaviors, but not in functions related to female fertility, indicates mechanistic differences in the roles of trace amines in these processes.",2007,"Shannon L Hardie, Jing X Zhang, Jay Hirsh"

To assess the viability of this form of biological control, studies towards understanding the molecular makeup of the snail relative to the presence of endogenous mobile genetic elements are being undertaken since they can be exploited for genetic transformation studies. We previously cloned a 1.95kb BamHI fragment in B. glabrata (BGR2) with sequence similarity to the human long interspersed nuclear element (LINE or L1). A contiguous, full-length sequence corresponding to BGR2, hereafter-named nimbus (BgI), has been identified from a B. glabrata bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library.

A Chado case study: an ontology-based modular schema for representing genome-associated biological information,17646315,10.1093/bioinformatics/btm189,"Motivation: A few years ago, FlyBase undertook to design a new database schema to store Drosophila data. It would fully integrate genomic sequence and annotation data with bibliographic, genetic, phenotypic and molecular data from the literature representing a distillation of the first 100 years of research on this major animal model system. In developing this new integrated schema, FlyBase also made a commitment to ensure that its design was generic, extensible and available as open source, so that it could be employed as the core schema of any model organism data repository, thereby avoiding redundant software development and potentially increasing interoperability. Our question was whether we could create a relational database schema that would be successfully reused. Results: Chado is a relational database schema now being used to manage biological knowledge for a wide variety of organisms, from human to pathogens, especially the classes of information that directly or indirectly can be associated with genome sequences or the primary RNA and protein products encoded by a genome. Biological databases that conform to this schema can interoperate with one another, and with application software from the Generic Model Organism Database (GMOD) toolkit. Chado is distinctive because its design is driven by ontologies. The use of ontologies (or controlled vocabularies) is ubiquitous across the schema, as they are used as a means of typing entities. The Chado schema is partitioned into integrated subschemas (modules), each encapsulating a different biological domain, and each described using representations in appropriate ontologies. To illustrate this methodology, we describe here the Chado modules used for describing genomic sequences.

The EGFR ligands Spitz and Keren act cooperatively in the Drosophila eye,17512517,10.1016/j.ydbio.2007.04.025,"The EGFR signalling cascade is responsible for coordinating a wide variety of events during Drosophila eye development. It remains something of a mystery how it is that cells are able to interpret the signal so as to choose the appropriate response from the battery of possibilities: division, differentiation, cell shape change and so on. Since the cascade is essentially linear below the receptor, different cellular responses cannot be regulated by alternative signal transduction pathways. The main diversity lies upstream, in the multiple activating ligands. Spitz, Gurken and Vein have been long studied, but little is known about the physiological functions of the fourth ligand, Keren, although various roles have been predicted based on the differences between mutants in the known ligands and those of the receptor. Here, we have isolated a mutant in the keren gene, and demonstrate that Keren does indeed participate in EGFR signalling in the eye, where it acts redundantly with Spitz to control R8 spacing, cell clustering and survival. Thus, specificity cannot be determined by ligand choice, and must instead be a consequence of cell-intrinsic factors, although we speculate that there may be some quantitative differences in signalling elicited by the two ligands.",2007,"Matthew Freeman, Martin Kerr, Katherine E Brown"
Nocturnal male sex drive in Drosophila,17276917,10.1016/j.cub.2006.11.049,"Many behaviors and physiological processes including locomotor activity, feeding, sleep, mating, and migration are dependent on daily or seasonally reoccurring, external stimuli. In D. melanogaster, one of the best-studied circadian behaviors is locomotion. The fruit fly is considered a diurnal (day active/night inactive) insect, based on locomotor-activity recordings of single, socially naive flies. We developed a new circadian paradigm that can simultaneously monitor two flies in simple social contexts. We find that heterosexual couples exhibit a drastically different locomotor-activity pattern than individual males, females, or homosexual couples. Specifically, male-female couples exhibit a brief rest phase around dusk but are highly active throughout the night and early morning. This distinct locomotor-activity rhythm is dependent on the clock genes and synchronized with close-proximity encounters, which reflect courtship, between the male and female. The close-proximity rhythm is dependent on the male and not the female and requires circadian oscillators in the brain and the antenna. Taken together, our data show that constant exposure to stimuli emanating from the female and received by the male olfactory and other sensory systems is responsible for the significant shift in intrinsic locomotor output of socially interacting flies.",2007,"Shinsuke Fujii, Paul Hardin, Parthasarathy Krishnan, Hubert Amrein"

In this paper we describe the tempo and changes that occur during male-killing by Spiroplasma bacteria in the host Drosophila nebulosa. Results: Spiroplasma infected D. nebulosa males were developmentally retarded from 6-8 h into embryonic development at 25 degrees C, and arrested at between stages 12 and 13 of embryogenesis (10-12 h). Dying males were characterized by a failure to form segments, and ultimately disintegration of the normal oval embryonic shape. Prior to death, dying males exhibited widespread apoptosis, as testified by TUNEL staining. Conclusion: The Spiroplasma kills male Drosophila in a narrow developmental period, shortly after the formation of the host dosage compensation complex that is required for male-killing. Male death is preceded by widespread apoptosis, but it is uncertain if this is primary or secondary apoptosis.",2007,"Joanna K Bentley, Joseph Heraty, Zoe Veneti, Gregory D D Hurst"
Egfr/Ras signaling regulates DE-cadherin/Shotgun localization to control vein morphogenesis in the Drosophila wing,17888420,10.1016/j.ydbio.2007.08.003,"Egfr/Ras signaling promotes vein cell fate specification in the developing Drosophila wing. While the importance of Ras signaling in vein determination has been extensively documented, the mechanisms linking Ras activity to vein differentiation remain unclear. We found that Ras signaling regulates both the levels and subcellular localization of the cell adhesion molecule DE-cadherin/Shotgun (Shg) in the differentiating wing epithelium. High Ras activity in presumptive vein cells directs the apical localization of Shg containing adherens junctions, whereas low Ras activity in intervein cells allows Shg to relocalize basally. These alterations in Shg-mediated adhesion control cell shape changes that are essential for vein morphogenesis. While Decapentaplegic (Dpp) acts downstream of Ras to maintain vein cell identity in the pupal wing, our results indicate that Ras controls Shg localization via a Dpp-independent mechanism. Ras, therefore, regulates both the transcriptional responses necessary for vein cell identity, and the cell adhesive changes that determine vein and intervein cell morphology.",2007,"David A Prober, David D O'Keefe, Wayne L Rickoll, Patrick S Moyle, Bruce A Edgar"
Working harder to stay alive: metabolic rate increases with age in Drosophila simulans but does not correlate with life span,17915248,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2007.07.006,"The hypothesis that metabolic rate is inversely correlated with life span has long been debated. Another area of controversy has been the relationship between metabolic rate and aging. In most molecular studies key aspects of cellular metabolism have been shown to decline with age. Less attention has been focused on metabolic rate as an organism ages. We studied the survival of three Drosophila simulans fly lines and measured whole organism metabolic rate, mitochondrial DNA copy number and walking speed. Metabolic rate as assayed by CO(2) production did not correlate with median lifespan but increased by 0.43-1.14%/d. In contrast, mitochondrial DNA copy number decreased by 0.56-1.06%/d. Physical activity, as assayed by mean walking speed, did not change with age but was positively correlated with mitochondrial DNA copy number. One explanation for these data is that metabolic rate was increased, in the face of a reduced mitochondrial DNA copy number and capacity for oxidative metabolism, to maintain a constant bioenergetic demand (physical activity). Alternatively, metabolic rate may increase to provide energy for the repair of cellular damage or due to a shift in metabolic substrate use over time.",2007,"J William O Ballard, Wayne A Van Voorhies, Richard G Melvin"
Sequence analysis and phylogenetic relationship of genes encoding heterodimeric phospholipases A2 from the venom of the scorpion Anuroctonus phaiodactylus,17466468,10.1016/j.gene.2007.03.007,"Some scorpion venom contain heterodimeric phospholipases A2. They were shown to be toxic to insects and to cause edema and/or hemolysis of mammalian erythrocytes. This manuscript describes the results of cDNA cloning of five different heterodimeric phospholipases from the venomous glands of the Mexican scorpion Anuroctonus phaiodactylus. The amino acid sequence deduced from the heterodimeric phospholipases open reading frames corresponds in each case to a different isoform. The nucleotide sequences corresponding to two of these genes were also obtained by directly sequencing genomic DNA. The cDNA isoforms show high similarity with the heterodimeric phospholipase Phaiodactylipin purified from the same scorpion. However, similar phospholipases were also found in scorpions from other species and the sequences available were used to construct a phylogenetic tree. In order to understand better the gene structure and phylogeny of these enzymes we analyzed their sequences and compared them with secretory phospholipases of other sources from groups I, II and III. The genomic DNA sequence of a similar phospholipase from bee venomous glands was also cloned. The information available on a Drosophila phospholipase was included in this analysis. The phospholipases of groups I and II contain a conserved exon-intron structure (four or five exons of the mature segment of the enzyme are separated by three or four introns). Also, the gene structure of the phospholipases from A. phaiodactylus and that of the bee venom, belonging to group III phospholipases, are interrupted by three introns. The mature peptide of the bee enzyme is a single polypeptide chain, coded by four exons, whereas those from the scorpion studied here although having four exons, showed the presence of two different polypeptides in its native state. The mature protein is processed after synthesis, producing the heterodimeric structure: a long and a short-peptide chain, linked by a disulfide bridge. The small subunit is the one coded by the fourth exon. The human phospholipase A2 and that of Drosophila, also classified into the group III phospholipases, have a considerably different exon-intron organization.",2007,"Miguel Corona, Lorenzo Segovia, Lourival D Possani, Norma A Valdez-Cruz"
Drosophila brain tumor metastases express both neuronal and glial cell type markers,17055475,10.1016/j.ydbio.2006.09.019,"Loss of either lgl or brat gene activity in Drosophila larvae causes neoplastic brain tumors. Fragments of tumorous brains from either mutant transplanted into adult hosts over-proliferate, and kill their hosts within 2 weeks. We developed an in vivo assay for the metastatic potential of tumor cells by quantifying micrometastasis formation within the ovarioles of adult hosts after transplantation and determined that specific metastatic properties of lgl and brat tumor cells are different. We detected micrometastases in 15.8% of ovarioles from wild type host females 12 days after transplanting lgl tumor cells into their abdominal cavities. This frequency increased significantly with increased proliferation time. We detected micrometastases in 15% of ovarioles from wild type host females 10 days after transplanting brat tumor cells into their abdominal cavities. By contrast, this frequency did not change significantly with increased proliferation time. We found that nearly all lgl micrometastases co-express the neuronal cell marker, ELAV, and the glial cell marker, REPO. These markers are not co-expressed in normal brain cells nor in tumorous brain cells. This indicates deregulated gene expression in these metastatic cells. By contrast, most of the brat micrometastases expressed neither marker. While mutations in both lgl and brat cause neoplastic brain tumors, our results reveal that metastatic cells arising from these tumors have quite different properties. These data may have important implications for the treatment of tumor metastasis.",2007,"Svetlana Trunova, Allen Shearn, Horacio Frydman, Julie Goodliffe, Michelle Beaucher, Evelyn Hersperger"
An epithelial niche in the Drosophila ovary undergoes long-range stem cell replacement,18371362,10.1016/j.stem.2007.07.009,"Adult epithelial stem cells are thought to reside in specific niches, where they are maintained by adhesion to stromal cells and by intercellular signals. In niches that harbor multiple adjacent stem cells, such as those maintaining Drosophila germ cells, lost stem cells are replaced by division of neighboring stem cells or reversion of transit cells. We have characterized the Drosophila follicle stem cell (FSC) niche as a model of the epithelial niche to learn whether nonneighboring cells can also generate stem cell replacements. Exactly two stroma-free FSC niches holding single FSCs are located in fixed locations on opposite edges of the Drosophila ovariole. FSC daughters regularly migrate across the width of the ovariole to the other niche before proliferating and contributing to the follicle cell monolayer. Crossmigrating FSC daughters compete with the resident FSC for niche occupancy and are the source of replacement FSCs. The ability of stem cell daughters to target a distant niche and displace its resident stem cell suggests that precancerous mutations might spread from niche to niche within stem cell-based tissues.",2007,"Allan Spradling, Todd Nystul"
Nucleosome positioning in relation to nucleosome spacing and DNA sequence-specific binding of a protein,17419736,10.1111/j.1742-4658.2007.05775.x,"Nucleosome positioning is an important mechanism for the regulation of eukaryotic gene expression. Folding of the chromatin fiber can influence nucleosome positioning, whereas similar electrostatic mechanisms govern the nucleosome repeat length and chromatin fiber folding in vitro. The position of the nucleosomes is directed either by the DNA sequence or by the boundaries created due to the binding of certain trans-acting factors to their target sites in the DNA. Increasing ionic strength results in an increase in nucleosome spacing on the chromatin assembled by the S-190 extract of Drosophila embryos. In this study, a mutant lac repressor protein R3 was used to find the mechanisms of nucleosome positioning on a plasmid with three R3-binding sites. With increasing ionic strength in the presence of R3, the number of positioned nucleosomes in the chromatin decreased, whereas the internucleosomal spacings of the positioned nucleosomes in a single register did not change. The number of the positioned nucleosomes in the chromatin assembled in vitro over different plasmid DNAs with 1-3 lac operators changed with the relative position and number of the R3-binding sites. We found that in the presence of R3, nucleosomes were positioned in the salt gradient method of the chromatin assembly, even in the absence of a nucleosome-positioning sequence. Our results show that nucleosome-positioning mechanisms are dominant, as the nucleosomes can be positioned even in the absence of regular spacing mechanisms. The protein-generated boundaries are more effective when more than one binding site is present with a minimum distance of approximately 165 bp, greater than the nucleosome core DNA length, between them.",2007,"Purnima Bhargava, Rama-Haritha Pusarla, Vinesh Vinayachandran"

Bias in phylogenetic tree reconciliation methods: implications for vertebrate genome evolution,17634151,10.1186/gb-2007-8-7-r141,"Background: Comparative genomic studies are revealing frequent gains and losses of whole genes via duplication and pseudogenization. One commonly used method for inferring the number and timing of gene gains and losses reconciles the gene tree for each gene family with the species tree of the taxa considered. Recent studies using this approach have found a large number of ancient duplications and recent losses among vertebrate genomes. Results: I show that tree reconciliation methods are biased when the inferred gene tree is not correct. This bias places duplicates towards the root of the tree and losses towards the tips of the tree. I demonstrate that this bias is present when tree reconciliation is conducted on both multiple mammal and Drosophila genomes, and that lower bootstrap cut-off values on gene trees lead to more extreme bias. I also suggest a method for dealing with reconciliation bias, although this method only corrects for the number of gene gains on some branches of the species tree. Conclusion: Based on the results presented, it is likely that most tree reconciliation analyses show biases, unless the gene trees used are exceptionally well-resolved and well-supported. These results cast doubt upon previous conclusions that vertebrate genome history has been marked by many ancient duplications and many recent gene losses.",2007,Matthew W Hahn
Subcellular distribution of importins correlates with germ cell maturation,17654710,10.1002/dvdy.21238,"Importin proteins regulate access to the nucleus by recognizing and transporting distinct cargo proteins.

Importin beta1 protein is detected in selected germ and somatic cells in fetal gonads, with a striking perinuclear staining evident from embryonic day (E) 14.5 within testicular gonocytes. RanBP5 exhibits age- and gender-specific subcellular localization within fetal gonads. At E12.5, RanBP5 protein is cytoplasmic in gonocytes but predominantly nuclear in oogonia, but by E14.5 RanBP5 appears nuclear in gonocytes and cytoplasmic in oogonia.

Nucleocytoplasmic shuttling mediates the dynamic maintenance of nuclear Dorsal levels during Drosophila embryogenesis,17978003,10.1242/dev.010934,"In Drosophila, the NF-kappaB/REL family transcription factor, Dorsal, redistributes from the cytoplasm to nuclei, forming a concentration gradient across the dorsoventral axis of the embryo. Using live imaging techniques in conjunction with embryos expressing a chimeric Dorsal-GFP, we demonstrate that the redistribution of Dorsal from cytoplasm to nucleus is an extremely dynamic process. Nuclear Dorsal concentration changes continuously over time in all nuclei during interphase. While Dorsal appears to be nuclearly localized primarily in ventral nuclei, it is actively shuttling into and out of all nuclei, including nuclei on the dorsal side. Nuclear export is blocked by leptomycin B, a potent inhibitor of Exportin 1 (CRM1)-mediated nuclear export. We have developed a novel in vivo assay revealing the presence of a functional leucine-rich nuclear export signal within the carboxyterminal 44 amino acids of Dorsal. We also find that diffusion of Dorsal is partially constrained to cytoplasmic islands surrounding individual syncitial nuclei. A model is proposed in which the generation and maintenance of the Dorsal gradient is a consequence of an active process involving both restricted long-range diffusion and the balancing of nuclear import with nuclear export.",2007,"Jennifer Lippincott-Schwartz, Yvonne DeLotto, Robert DeLotto, Ruth Steward"
Dynamic decapentaplegic signaling regulates patterning and adhesion in the Drosophila pupal retina,17428827,10.1242/dev.002972,"The correct organization of cells within an epithelium is essential for proper tissue and organ morphogenesis. The role of Decapentaplegic/Bone morphogenetic protein (Dpp/BMP) signaling in cellular morphogenesis during epithelial development is poorly understood. In this paper, we used the developing Drosophila pupal retina--looking specifically at the reorganization of glial-like support cells that lie between the retinal ommatidia--to better understand the role of Dpp signaling during epithelial patterning. Our results indicate that Dpp pathway activity is tightly regulated across time in the pupal retina and that epithelial cells in this tissue require Dpp signaling to achieve their correct shape and position within the ommatidial hexagon. These results point to the Dpp pathway as a third component and functional link between two adhesion systems, Hibris-Roughest and DE-cadherin. A balanced interplay between these three systems is essential for epithelial patterning during morphogenesis of the pupal retina. Importantly, we identify a similar functional connection between Dpp activity and DE-cadherin and Rho1 during cell fate determination in the wing, suggesting a broader link between Dpp function and junctional integrity during epithelial development.",2007,"Julia B Cordero, Rebecca Hays, Ross Cagan, David E Larson, Caroline R Craig"
Semaphorin-1a controls receptor neuron-specific axonal convergence in the primary olfactory center of Drosophila,17224401,10.1016/j.neuron.2006.12.024,"In the olfactory system of Drosophila, 50 functional classes of sensory receptor neurons (ORNs) project in a highly organized fashion into the CNS, where they sort out from one another and converge into distinct synaptic glomeruli. We identified the transmembrane molecule Semaphorin-1a (Sema-1a) as an essential component to ensure glomerulus-specific axon segregation. Removal of sema-1a in ORNs does not affect the pathfinding toward their target area but disrupts local axonal convergence into a single glomerulus, resulting in two distinct targeting phenotypes: axons either intermingle with adjacent ORN classes or segregate according to their odorant receptor identity into ectopic sites. Differential Sema-1a expression can be detected among neighboring glomeruli, and mosaic analyses show that sema-1a functions nonautonomously in ORN axon sorting. These findings provide insights into the mechanism by which afferent interactions lead to synaptic specificity in the olfactory system.",2007,"Thomas Hummel, Sascha Seidl, Ariane Zierau, Marc Lattemann, Claus Schulte, Britta Kuhlmann"
Control of morphogenetic cell movements in the early zebrafish myotome,17689522,10.1016/j.ydbio.2007.06.008,"As the vertebrate myotome is generated, myogenic precursor cells undergo extensive and coordinated movements as they differentiate into properly positioned embryonic muscle fibers. In the zebrafish, the ""adaxial"" cells adjacent to the notochord are the first muscle precursors to be specified. After initially differentiating into slow-twitch myosin-expressing muscle fibers, these cells have been shown to undergo a remarkable radial migration through the lateral somite, to populate the superficial layer of slow-twitch muscle of the mature myotome. Here we characterize an earlier set of adaxial cell behaviors; the transition from a roughly 4x5 array of cuboidal cells to a 1x20 stack of elongated cells, prior to the migration event. We find that adaxial cells display a highly stereotypical series of behaviors as they undergo this rearrangement. Furthermore, we show that the actin regulatory molecule, Cap1, is specifically expressed in adaxial cells and is required for the progression of these behaviors. The requirement of Cap1 for a cellular apical constriction step is reminiscent of similar requirements of Cap during apical constriction in Drosophila development, suggesting a conservation of gene function for a cell biological event critical to many developmental processes.",2007,"Carmen R Domingo, Sharon L Amacher, David F Daggett, Peter D Currie"
RNA is an integral component of chromatin that contributes to its structural organization,18000552,10.1371/journal.pone.0001182,"Chromatin structure is influenced by multiples factors, such as pH, temperature, nature and concentration of counterions, post-translational modifications of histones and binding of structural non-histone proteins. RNA is also known to contribute to the regulation of chromatin structure as chromatin-induced gene silencing was shown to depend on the RNAi machinery in S. pombe, plants and Drosophila. Moreover, both in Drosophila and mammals, dosage compensation requires the contribution of specific non-coding RNAs. However, whether RNA itself plays a direct structural role in chromatin is not known. Here, we report results that indicate a general structural role for RNA in eukaryotic chromatin. RNA is found associated to purified chromatin prepared from chicken liver, or cultured Drosophila S2 cells, and treatment with RNase A alters the structural properties of chromatin. Our results indicate that chromatin-associated RNAs, which account for 2%-5% of total chromatin-associated nucleic acids, are polyA(-) and show a size similar to that of the DNA contained in the corresponding chromatin fragments. Chromatin-associated RNA(s) are not likely to correspond to nascent transcripts as they are also found bound to chromatin when cells are treated with alpha-amanitin. After treatment with RNase A, chromatin fragments of molecular weight >3.000 bp of DNA showed reduced sedimentation through sucrose gradients and increased sensitivity to micrococcal nuclease digestion.

Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the corresponding gene is in a group that has been designated NHA, and which includes (Na+ or K+)/H+ antiporters; so the novel transporter is called AgNHA1. The annotation of current insect genomes shows that both AgNHA1 and a close relative, AgNHA2, belong to the cation proton antiporter 2 (CPA2) subfamily and cluster in an exclusive clade of genes with high identity from Aedes aegypti, Drosophila melanogaster, D. pseudoobscura, Apis mellifera and Tribolium castaneum. Although NHA genes have been identified in all phyla for which genomes are available, no NHA other than AgNHA1 has previously been cloned, nor have the encoded proteins been localized or characterized. The AgNHA1 transcript was localized in An. gambiae larvae by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and in situ hybridization. AgNHA1 message was detected in gastric caeca and rectum, with much weaker transcription in other parts of the alimentary canal. Immunolabeling of whole mounts and longitudinal sections of isolated alimentary canal showed that AgNHA1 is expressed in the cardia, gastric caeca, anterior midgut, posterior midgut, proximal Malpighian tubules and rectum, as well as in the subesophageal and abdominal ganglia. A phylogenetic analysis of NHAs and KHAs indicates that they are ubiquitous. A comparative molecular analysis of these antiporters suggests that they catalyze electrophoretic alkali metal ion/hydrogen ion exchanges that are driven by the voltage from electrogenic H+ V-ATPases.

We undertook association studies with crosses from a single population of D. melanogaster from eastern Australia to investigate the association between genetic markers and traits showing clinal variation. By genotyping parents and phenotyping offspring, we minimized genotyping costs but had the power to detect association between markers and quantitative traits. Consistent with prior studies, we found strong associations between the clinal chromosomal inversion In(3R)Payne and markers within it, as well as among these markers. We also found an association between In(3L)Payne and one marker located within this inversion. Of the five predicted associations between markers and traits, four were detected (increased heat, decreased cold resistance and body size with the heat shock gene hsr-omega S, increased cold resistance with the inversion In(3L)Payne), while one was not detected (heat resistance and the heat shock gene hsp68).

Mechanisms of programmed cell death during oogenesis in Drosophila virilis,17004067,10.1007/s00441-006-0298-x,"We describe the features of programmed cell death occurring in the egg chambers of Drosophila virilis during mid-oogenesis and late oogenesis. During mid-oogenesis, the spontaneously degenerating egg chambers exhibit typical characteristics of apoptotic cell death. As revealed by propidium iodide, rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin staining, and the TUNEL assay, respectively, the nurse cells contain condensed chromatin, altered actin cytoskeleton, and fragmented DNA. In vitro caspase activity assays and immunostaining procedures demonstrate that the atretic egg chambers possess high levels of caspase activity. Features of autophagic cell death are also observed during D. virilis mid-oogenesis, as shown by monodansylcadaverine staining, together with an ultrastructural examination by transmission electron microscopy. During the late stages of oogenesis in D. virilis, once again, the two mechanisms, viz., nurse cell cluster apoptosis and autophagy, operate together, manifesting features of cell death similar to those detailed above. Moreover, an altered form of cytochrome c seems to be released from the mitochondria in the nurse cells proximal to the oocyte.

Characterization of the role of the Synaptotagmin family as calcium sensors in facilitation and asynchronous neurotransmitter release,17709738,10.1073/pnas.0706711104,"Ca(2+) influx into presynaptic nerve terminals activates synaptic vesicle exocytosis by triggering fast synchronous fusion and a slower asynchronous release pathway. In addition, a brief rise in Ca(2+) after consecutive action potentials has been correlated with a form of short-term synaptic plasticity with enhanced vesicle fusion termed facilitation. Although the synaptic vesicle protein Synaptotagmin 1 (Syt1) has been implicated as the Ca(2+) sensor for synchronous fusion, the molecular identity of the Ca(2+) sensors that mediate facilitation and asynchronous release is unknown. To test whether the synchronous Ca(2+) sensor, Syt1, or the asynchronous Ca(2+) sensor is involved in facilitation, we analyzed whether genetic elimination of Syt1 in Drosophila results in a concomitant impairment in facilitation. Our results indicate that Syt1 acts as a redundant Ca(2+) sensor for facilitation, with the asynchronous Ca(2+) sensor contributing significantly to this form of short-term plasticity. We next examined whether other members of the Drosophila Syt family functioned in Ca(2+)-dependent asynchronous release or facilitation in vivo. Genetic elimination of other panneuronally expressed Syt proteins did not alter these forms of exocytosis, indicating a non-Syt Ca(2+) sensor functions for both facilitation and asynchronous release. In light of these findings, the presence of two presynaptic Ca(2+) sensors can be placed in a biological context, a Syt1-based Ca(2+) sensor devoted primarily to baseline synaptic transmission and a second non-Syt Ca(2+) sensor for short-term synaptic plasticity and asynchronous release.",2007,"Bill Adolfsen, J Troy Littleton, Sudipta Saraswati"

Using several pros-Voila (prosV) alleles, that induce multiple developmental and behavioral anomalies in the larva and in adult, we explored the relationship between these phenotypes and the variation of pros expression in 5 different neural regions during pre-imaginal development. We found that the quantity of pros mRNA spliced variants and of Pros protein varied between these alleles in a tissue-specific and developmental way.

An endogenous suppressor of hairy-wing insulator separates regulatory domains in Drosophila,14597701,10.1073/pnas.2333111100,"Insulators define independent domains of gene function throughout the genome. The Drosophila gypsy insulator was isolated from the gypsy retrotransposon as a region that contains a cluster of binding sites for the Suppressor of Hairy-wing [Su(Hw)] protein. To study the effects of the gypsy insulator on gene expression within a single genomic domain, targeted gene replacement was used to exchange the endogenous yellow gene, located at cytological location 1A, with a set of gypsy-modified yellow genes. Replaced yellow genes carried a gypsy insulator positioned between the yellow promoter and either the upstream or the downstream tissue-specific enhancers. Whereas the gypsy insulator blocked the function of the upstream enhancers at the endogenous location, the downstream enhancers were not blocked. Investigation of the 1A region revealed two clustered Su(Hw)-binding sites downstream of the yellow gene, named 1A-2, that bind Su(Hw) in vivo and possess enhancer blocking function. We propose that interaction between 1A-2 and the gypsy insulator permits activation of yellow expression by enhancers in the neighboring achaete-scute complex, causing an apparent absence of the block of the downstream yellow enhancers. Based on these data, we suggest that 1A-2 is an endogenous Su(Hw) insulator that separates regulatory domains within the Drosophila genome.",2003,"Cecilia Helou, Emily J Kuhn, Timothy J Parnell, Michaela M Viering, Astrid Skjesol, Pamela K Geyer"
dDYRK2: a novel dual-specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation-regulated kinase in Drosophila,12786602,10.1042/BJ20030500,"Dual-specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation-regulated kinases (DYRKs) are an emerging family of protein kinases that have been identified in all eukaryotic organisms examined to date. DYRK family members are involved in regulating key developmental and cellular processes such as neurogenesis, cell proliferation, cytokinesis and cellular differentiation. Two distinct subgroups exist, nuclear and cytosolic. In Drosophila, the founding family member minibrain, whose human orthologue maps to the Down syndrome critical region, belongs to the nuclear subclass and affects post-embryonic neurogenesis. In the present paper, we report the isolation of dDYRK2, a cytosolic DYRK and the putative product of the smell-impaired smi35A gene. This is the second such kinase described in Drosophila, but the first to be characterized at the molecular and biochemical level. dDYRK2 is an 81 kDa dual-specificity kinase that autophosphorylates on tyrosine and serine/threonine residues, but appears to phosphorylate exogenous substrates only on serine/threonine residues. It contains a YXY motif in the activation loop of the kinase domain in the same location as the TXY motif in mitogen-activated protein kinases. dDYRK2 is tyrosine-phosphorylated in vivo, and mutational analysis reveals that the activation loop tyrosines are phosphorylated and are essential for kinase activity. Finally, dDYRK2 is active at all stages of fly development, with elevated levels observed during embryogenesis and pupation.",2003,"Gary Sibbet, Deborah K Morrison, Ross Kinstrie, Vaughn Cleghon, Pamela A Lochhead, Tava Cleghon, Margie Rylatt"
Signal trait sexual dimorphism and mutual sexual selection in Drosophila serrata,14628920,10.1111/j.0014-3820.2003.tb00244.x,"The evolution of sexual dimorphism may occur when natural and sexual selection result in different optimum trait values for males and females. Perhaps the most prominent examples of sexual dimorphism occur in sexually selected traits, for which males usually display exaggerated trait levels, while females may show reduced expression of the trait. In some species, females also exhibit secondary sexual traits that may either be a consequence of a correlated response to sexual selection on males or direct sexual selection for female secondary sexual traits. In this experiment, we simultaneously measure the intersex genetic correlations and the relative strength of sexual selection on males and females for a set of cuticular hydrocarbons in Drosophila serrata. There was significant directional sexual selection on both male and female cuticular hydrocarbons: the strength of sexual selection did not differ among the sexes but males and females preferred different cuticular hydrocarbons. In contrast with many previous studies of sexual dimorphism, intersex genetic correlations were low. The evolution of sexual dimorphism in D. serrata appears to have been achieved by sex-limited expression of traits controlled by genes on the X chromosome and is likely to be in its final stages.",2003,"Stephen F Chenoweth, Mark W Blows"
Genetics of sleep and sleep disorders,12700094,10.2741/1084,"Sleep has been observed in all vertebrates studied and in several invertebrates, notably the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. In all species, a substantial portion of life is spent in this behavioral state and disturbed sleep or lack of sleep has immediate negative impacts on performance and health. Although it is agreed upon that sleep fulfills a fundamental biological need, the function of sleep remains an enigma. Because the expression and regulation of sleep and some sleep disorders have strong genetic components, the recent progress in human, mouse, and fruit-fly genome sequencing projects have given rise to the expectation that the molecular pathways underlying sleep disorders and sleep regulation or even function can now be more readily identified. We review here available genetic data both from basic sleep research and sleep disorders with emphasis on recent advances in our understanding of the molecular basis of the homeostatic regulation of sleep. Recent studies in the dog, the mouse, and the fruit-fly have begun to reveal exciting new molecular pathways that regulate sleep. This illustrates that only the continued use of multiple animal models and genetic approaches will ensure a rapid progress in the relatively new field of sleep genetics.",2003,"Mehdi Tafti, Paul Franken"
Genesis and pathogenesis of lymphatic vessels,12942362,10.1007/s00441-003-0777-2,"The lymphatic system is generally regarded as supplementary to the blood vascular system, in that it transports interstitial fluid, macromolecules, and immune cells back into the blood. However, in insects, the open hemolymphatic (or lymphohematic) system ensures the circulation of immune cells and interstitial fluid through the body. The Drosophila homolog of the mammalian vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) gene family is expressed in hemocytes, suggesting a close relationship to the endothelium that develops later in phylogeny. Lymph hearts are typical organs for the propulsion of lymph in lower vertebrates and are still transiently present in birds. The lymphatic endothelial marker VEGFR-3 is transiently expressed in embryonic blood vessels and is crucial for their development. We therefore regard the question of whether the blood vascular system or the lymphatic system is primary or secondary as open. Future molecular comparisons should be performed without any bias based on the current prevalence of the blood vascular system over the lymphatic system. Here, we give an overview of the structure, function, and development of the lymphatics, with special emphasis on the recently discovered lymphangiogenic growth factors.",2003,"Michael Jeltsch, Tuomas Tammela, Kari Alitalo, Jörg Wilting"
Paucity of genes on the Drosophila X chromosome showing male-biased expression,12511656,10.1126/science.1079190,"Sex chromosomes are primary determinants of sexual dimorphism in many organisms. These chromosomes are thought to arise via the divergence of an ancestral autosome pair and are almost certainly influenced by differing selection in males and females. Exploring how sex chromosomes differ from autosomes is highly amenable to genomic analysis. We examined global gene expression in Drosophila melanogaster and report a dramatic underrepresentation of X-chromosome genes showing high relative expression in males. Using comparative genomics, we find that these same X-chromosome genes are exceptionally poorly conserved in the mosquito Anopheles gambiae. These data indicate that the X chromosome is a disfavored location for genes selectively expressed in males.",2003,"Daniel Naiman, Scott Eastman, Michael Parisi, James Malley, Brian Oliver, Gerard Bouffard, Justen Andrews, Rachel Nuttall"
Construction of a cDNA-based microarray for Drosophila melanogaster: a comparison of gene transcription profiles from SL2 and Kc167 cells,14608405,10.1139/g03-056,"We have constructed a DNA microarray that represents approximately 6900 of the estimated 13,598 genes in the Drosophila melanogaster genome. The microarray contains 5756 target cDNAs from the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project, 1078 cDNAs from the National Institutes of Health Drosophila testis cDNA library, and 546 gene fragments that were amplified from genomic DNA. The methods for DNA amplification and microarray manufacture are presented. Academic researchers can obtain the microarray from the Canadian Drosophila Microarray Centre. To evaluate the utility of these arrays, we compared the gene transcription profiles of two commonly used Drosophila cell lines. Analysis revealed that 5412 spot pairs gave signals consistently above the average background in Kc167 cells, whereas 5636 spot pairs met this criterion in SL2 cells. When the expression profiles of the cell lines were compared, 1437 genes displayed at least a 1.5-fold difference, and 170 genes had a threefold or greater difference between the two cell lines. In each case, with respect to Kc167 when compared with SL2 cells, the number of genes that were upregulated was nearly equal to the number of downregulated genes. This result demonstrates that despite the similar embryonic derivation of both cell lines, their transcriptional profiles are very different.",2003,"Meredith L Gibson, J Timothy Westwood, Anthony K-C So, Scott J Neal"
Genetic constraints on the evolution of mate recognition under natural selection,12675370,10.1086/345783,"Field populations of Drosophila serrata display reproductive character displacement in cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) when sympatric with Drosophila birchii. We have previously shown that the naturally occurring pattern of reproductive character displacement can be experimentally replicated by exposing field allopatric populations of D. serrata to experimental sympatry with D. birchii. Here, we tested whether the repeated evolution of reproductive character displacement in natural and experimental populations was a consequence of genetic constraints on the evolution of CHCs. The genetic variance-covariance (G) matrices for CHCs were determined for populations of D. serrata that had evolved in either the presence or absence of D. birchii under field and experimental conditions. Natural selection on mate recognition under both field and experimental sympatric conditions increased the genetic variance in CHCs consistent with a response to selection based on rare alleles. A close association between G eigenstructure and the eigenstructure of the phenotypic divergence (D) matrix in natural and experimental populations suggested that G matrix eigenstructure may have determined the direction in which reproductive character displacement evolved during the reinforcement of mate recognition.",2003,"Mark W Blows, Megan Higgie"
The Drosophila Corto protein interacts with Polycomb-group proteins and the GAGA factor,12771214,10.1093/nar/gkg381,"In Drosophila, PcG complexes provide heritable transcriptional silencing of target genes. Among them, the ESC/E(Z) complex is thought to play a role in the initiation of silencing whereas other complexes such as the PRC1 complex are thought to maintain it. PcG complexes are thought to be recruited to DNA through interaction with DNA binding proteins such as the GAGA factor, but no direct interactions between the constituents of PcG complexes and the GAGA factor have been reported so far. The Drosophila corto gene interacts with E(z) as well as with genes encoding members of maintenance complexes, suggesting that it could play a role in the transition between the initiation and maintenance of PcG silencing. Moreover, corto also interacts genetically with Trl, which encodes the GAGA factor, suggesting that it may serve as a mediator in recruiting PcG complexes. Here, we show that Corto bears a chromo domain and we provide evidence for in vivo association of Corto with ESC and with PC in embryos. Moreover, we show by GST pull-down and two-hybrid experiments that Corto binds to E(Z), ESC, PH, SCM and GAGA and co-localizes with these proteins on a few sites on polytene chromosomes. These results reinforce the idea that Corto plays a role in PcG silencing, perhaps by confering target specificity.",2003,"Frédérique Peronnet, Antoine Boivin, Juliette Salvaing, Aurore Lopez, Jean S Deutsch"
Immunohistochemical study of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II in the Drosophila brain using a specific monoclonal antibody,12742628,10.1016/s0006-8993(03)02562-9,"To analyze the distribution of Drosophila calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (dCaMKII) in the adult brain, we generated monoclonal antibodies against the bacterially expressed 490-amino acid (a.a.) form of dCaMKII. One of those, named #18 antibody, was used for this study. Western blot analysis of the adult head extracts showed that the antibody specifically detects multiple bands between 55 and 60 kDa corresponding to the molecular weights of the splicing isoforms of dCaMKII. Epitope mapping revealed that it was in the region between 199 and 283 a.a. of dCaMKII. Preferential dCaMKII immunoreactivity in the embryonic nervous system, adult thoracic ganglion and gut, and larval neuro-muscular junction (NMJ) was consistent with previous observations by in situ hybridization and immunostaining with a polyclonal antibody at the NMJ, indicating that the antibody is applicable to immunohistochemistry. Although dCaMKII immunoreactive signal was low in the retina, it was found at regular intervals in the outer margin of the compound eye. These signals were most likely to be interommatidial bristle mechanosensory neurons. dCaMKII immunoreactivity in the brain was observed in almost all regions and relatively higher staining was found in the neuropilar region than in the cortex. Higher dCaMKII immunoreactivity in the mushroom body (MB) was found in the entire gamma lobe including the heel, and dorsal tips of the alpha and alpha' lobes, while cores of alpha and beta lobes were stained light. Finding abundant dCaMKII accumulation in the gamma lobe suggested that this lobe might especially require high levels of dCaMKII expression to function properly among MB lobes.",2003,"Shunji Ohsako, Yasuko Kishimoto, Yoshiki Takamatsu"
Amino acids modulate ion transport and fluid secretion by insect Malpighian tubules,12456699,10.1242/jeb.00058,"Insect haemolymph typically contains very high levels of free amino acids. This study shows that amino acids can modulate the secretion of ions and water by isolated Malpighian tubules of Rhodnius prolixus and Drosophila melanogaster. Secretion rates of Rhodnius tubules in amino-acid-free saline increase after addition of serotonin to a peak value, then slowly decline to a plateau. Addition of glutamine, glutamate or aspartate to such tubules increases secretion rates dramatically relative to the controls in amino-acid-free saline, and these increases are sustained for 1-2 h. Seven other amino acids have more modest stimulatory effects, whereas lysine and arginine are inhibitory. Secreted fluid pH and Na(+) concentration increase and K(+) concentration decreases in response to glutamine. Pre-incubation of unstimulated tubules in saline solutions containing amino acids followed by stimulation with serotonin in amino-acid-free saline shows that the effects of amino acids far outlast the duration of exposure to them. Amino acids do not appear to be important as metabolites in Rhodnius tubules, nor do they act to draw significant amounts of water into the lumen by osmosis. Significant stimulation of fluid secretion can be achieved by physiological levels of particular amino acids, whereas those amino acids that inhibit fluid secretion only do so at concentrations much above those at which they occur naturally in the haemolymph. Secretion rates of unstimulated or stimulated Drosophila tubules are increased by pre-incubation in saline solutions containing glutamine or methionine or by continuous exposure to glutamine, methionine or tyrosine. Cysteine dramatically inhibited fluid secretion by Drosophila tubules, but only at concentrations well above the physiological range. We suggest that the amino acids probably function as compatible intracellular osmolytes that are necessary for sustained secretion at high rates by the Malpighian tubules.",2003,"Simon H P Maddrell, Robert J Christensen, Michael J O'Donnell, Juan P Ianowski, Matthew H Hazel"
Cellular distribution of innexin 1 and 2 gap junctional channel proteins in epithelia of the Drosophila embryo,14681020,10.1080/cac.10.4-6.221.225,"Invertebrate gap junctions are composed of Innexin channel proteins that are structurally and functionally analogous to the connexins in vertebrates. In situ hybridization experiments have shown that most of the eight known innexin genes in Drosophila are expressed in a complex and overlapping temporal and spatial profile, with several members showing high levels of expression in developing epithelia of the embryo. To further study the cellular roles of Innexins, we have generated antibodies against Innexins 1 and 2 and studied their protein distribution in the developing embryo. We find that both Innexins are co-expressed in a number of epithelial tissues including the epidermis, the gut and the salivary glands. On the cellular level, we find both proteins localized to the membranes of epithelial cells. Immunohistochemical analysis using cell polarity markers indicates that Innexin 1 is predominantly localized to the baso-lateral domain of epithelial cells, basal to septate junctions. In contrast, we find a variable positioning of Innexin 2 along the apico-basal axis of epithelial cells depending on the type of tissue and organ. Our findings suggest that the distribution of Innexin channel proteins to specific membrane domains of epithelial cells is regulated by tissue specific factors during the development of epithelia in the fly embryo.",2003,"Julia Martini, Reinhard Bauer, Corinna Lehmann, Michael Hoch"
Novel level of signalling control in the JAK/STAT pathway revealed by in situ visualisation of protein-protein interaction during Drosophila development,12783781,10.1242/dev.00535,"It is commonly accepted that activation of most signalling pathways is induced by ligand receptor dimerisation. This belief has been challenged for some vertebrate cytokine receptors of the JAK/STAT pathway. Here we study whether DOME, the Drosophila receptor of the JAK/STAT pathway, can dimerise and if the dimerisation is ligand-dependent. To analyse DOME homo-dimerisation, we have applied a beta-gal complementation technique that allows the detection of protein interactions in situ. This technique has been used previously in cell culture but this is the first time that it has been applied to whole embryos. We show that this technique, which we rename betalue-betalau technique, can be used to detect DOME homo-dimerisation in Drosophila developing embryos. Despite DOME being ubiquitously expressed, dimerisation is developmentally regulated. We investigate the state of DOME dimerisation in the presence or absence of ligand and show that DOME dimerisation is not ligand-induced, indicating that ligand independent cytokine receptor dimerisation is a conserved feature across phyla. We have further analysed the functional significance of ligand-independent receptor dimerisation by comparing the effects of ectopic ligand expression in cells in which the receptor is, or is not, dimerised. We show that ligand expression can only activate STAT downstream targets or affect embryo development in cells in which the receptor is dimerised. These results suggest a model in which ligand-independent dimerisation of the JAK/STAT receptor confers cells with competence to activate the pathway prior to ligand reception. Thus, competence to induce the JAK/STAT signalling pathway in Drosophila can be regulated by controlling receptor dimerisation prior to ligand binding. These results reveal a novel level of JAK/STAT signalling regulation that could also apply to vertebrates.",2003,"Stephen Brown, Nan Hu, James Castelli-Gair Hombría"
Quantitative trait symmetry independent of Hsp90 buffering: distinct modes of genetic canalization and developmental stability,14595030,10.1073/pnas.1835613100,"The Hsp90 chaperone buffers development against a wide range of morphological changes in many organisms and in Drosophila masks the effects of hidden genetic variation. Theory predicts that genetic and nongenetic buffering will share common mechanisms. For example, it is argued that Hsp90 genetic buffering evolved solely as a by-product of environmental buffering, and that Hsp90 should mask morphological deviations from any source. To test this idea, we examined the effect of Hsp90 on purely nongenetic variation in phenotype, measured as differences between the left and right sides of several bilaterally symmetrical bristle and wing traits in individual flies. Consistent with previous reports, Hsp90 buffered the expression of rare morphogenic variants specific to particular genetic backgrounds. However, neither trait-by-trait nor global asymmetry was affected in outbred flies treated with an Hsp90 inhibitor or across a series of inbred genetic backgrounds from a wild population tested in isogenic F1 heterozygotes carrying either (i) a dominant negative Hsp90 allele on a mutant 3rd chromosome or (ii) a null P-insertion mutation, which was introgressed into the control genetic background on all chromosomes. By contrast, Hsp90-regulated trait means and significant effects of sex, temperature, and genetic background on trait symmetry were clearly detected. We conclude that, by maintaining the function of signaling proteins, Hsp90 masks variation affecting target pathways and traits in populations independent of purely nongenetic sources of variation, refuting the idea that a single Hsp90-dependent process generally controls genetic canalization and developmental stability.",2003,"Philip Batterham, Ary A Hoffmann, Claire C Milton, Brandon Huynh, Suzanne L Rutherford"
Evolution of multiple components of virulence in Drosophila-nematode associations,12940359,10.1111/j.0014-3820.2003.tb00362.x,"Virulence is of central importance in host-parasite interactions, yet little is known about how it changes over extended evolutionary periods. In this study, all four species in the testacea species group of Drosophila were experimentally infected with sympatric and allopatric nematodes in the Howardula aoronymphium species complex, and the effect of parasite infection on three components of host fitness was determined. The Drosophila species show striking differences in their responses to infection, with reductions reaching 80% in adult lifespan, 100% in female fertility, and 90% in male fertility. Female sterility appears to be determined by the host; species that are sterilized by their local nematodes are also sterilized by the other allopatric nematodes in the H. aoronymphium complex. Host species that are not sterilized by their local parasite are not sterilized by other nematodes in the complex. In contrast, reductions in host adult lifespan and male fertility depend on both the host and the parasite. Whereas all nematodes reduced the survival of their local host species equally (about 40-45%), survival of two host species was drastically reduced (about 80%) when infected with an allopatric parasite. Thus, virulence is evolutionarily labile in associations between Drosophila testacea group species and their Howardula parasites. The data suggest that changes in the sterility component of virulence are due primarily to host evolution, whereas changes in the host mortality component are due in large part to parasite evolution.",2003,"Steve J Perlman, John Jaenike"
Temporal regulation of microRNA expression in Drosophila melanogaster mediated by hormonal signals and broad-Complex gene activity,12812784,10.1016/s0012-1606(03)00208-2,"lin-4 and let-7 are founding members of an extensive family of genes that produce small transcripts, termed microRNAs (miRNAs). In Caenorhabditis elegans, lin-4 and let-7 control the timing of postembryonic events by translational repression of target genes, permitting progression from early to late developmental programs. To identify Drosophila melanogaster miRNAs that could play similar roles in the control of developmental timing, we characterized the developmental expression profile of 24 miRNAs in Drosophila, and found 7 miRNAs that are either upregulated or downregulated in conjunction with metamorphosis. The upregulation of three of these miRNAs (mir-100, mir-125, and let-7), and the downregulation of a fourth (mir-34) requires the hormone ecdysone (Ecd) and the activity of the Ecd-inducible gene Broad-Complex. Interestingly, mir-125 is a putative homologue of lin-4. mir-100, -125, and let-7 are clustered within an 800-bp region on chromosome 2L, suggesting that these three miRNAs may be coordinately regulated via common cis-acting elements during metamorphosis. In S2 cells, Ecd and the juvenile hormone analog methoprene exert opposite effects on the expression of these four miRNAs, indicating the participation of both these hormones in the temporal regulation of mir-34, -100, -125, and let-7 expression in vivo.",2003,"Nicholas S Sokol, Victor Ambros, Edward M Berger, Lorenzo F Sempere, Edward B Dubrovsky"
Roles of myosin phosphatase during Drosophila development,12505998,10.1242/dev.00298,"Myosins are a superfamily of actin-dependent molecular motor proteins, among which the bipolar filament forming myosins II have been the most studied. The activity of smooth muscle/non-muscle myosin II is regulated by phosphorylation of the regulatory light chains, that in turn is modulated by the antagonistic activity of myosin light chain kinase and myosin light chain phosphatase. The phosphatase activity is mainly regulated through phosphorylation of its myosin binding subunit MYPT. To identify the function of these phosphorylation events, we have molecularly characterized the Drosophila homologue of MYPT, and analyzed its mutant phenotypes. We find that Drosophila MYPT is required for cell sheet movement during dorsal closure, morphogenesis of the eye, and ring canal growth during oogenesis. Our results indicate that the regulation of the phosphorylation of myosin regulatory light chains, or dynamic activation and inactivation of myosin II, is essential for its various functions during many developmental processes.",2003,"Change Tan, Beth Stronach, Norbert Perrimon"
Sequence fingerprints in BRCA2 and RAD51: implications for DNA repair and cancer,12967658,10.1016/s1568-7864(03)00097-1,"In humans, the interactions between the breast cancer susceptibility protein, BRCA2, and the RAD51 recombinase are essential for DNA repair by homologous recombination (HR), failure of which can predispose to cancer. The interactions occur through conserved BRC repeat motifs, encoded in BRCA2, binding directly to RAD51. Here, we describe full and partial BRCA2 homologues from a wide range of eukaryotes, including Drosophila melanogaster and two Plasmodium species. The crystal structure of the human BRC4-RAD51 complex allows identification of residues that are important for protein-protein interaction, and defines interaction sequence fingerprints for the BRC repeat and for RAD51. These allow us to predict that most eukaryotic RAD51 and BRC repeat orthologues should be capable of mutual interactions. We find no evidence for the presence of BRC repeats in yeast, Archaea and bacteria, and their RAD51 orthologues do not fulfil the criteria for binding the BRC repeat. Similarly, human RAD51 paralogues, including RAD51B, RAD51C, RAD51D, XRCC2, XRCC3 and DMC1, are not predicted to bind the BRC repeat. Conservation of the BRC repeat and RAD51 sequence fingerprints across a wide range of eukaryotic species substantiates the functional significance of the BRCA2-RAD51 interactions. The idea of multiple BRC repeats with binding specificity towards RAD51 leads us to suggest a possible model for the participation of BRCA2 in RAD51 nucleoprotein filament formation.",2003,"Luca Pellegrini, Tom L Blundell, Thomas Lo, Ashok R Venkitaraman"
In developing Drosophila neurones the production of gamma-amino butyric acid is tightly regulated downstream of glutamate decarboxylase translation and can be influenced by calcium,12603819,10.1046/j.1471-4159.2003.01554.x,"The presented work pioneers the embryonic Drosophila CNS for studies of the developmental regulation and function of gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA). We describe for the first time the developmental pattern of GABA in Drosophila and address underlying regulatory mechanisms. Surprisingly, and in contrast to vertebrates, detectable levels of GABA occur late during Drosophila neurogenesis, after essential neuronal proliferation and growth have taken place and synaptogenesis has been initiated. This timeline is almost unchanged when the GABA synthetase glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) is strongly misexpressed throughout the nervous system suggesting a tight post-translational regulation of GABA expression. We confirmed such GABA control mechanisms in an independent model system, i.e. primary Drosophila cell cultures raised in elevated [K+]. The data suggest that, in both systems, GABA suppression occurs via control of GAD activity. Using developing embryos and cell cultures as parallel assay systems for pharmacological and genetic studies we show that the negative regulation of GAD can be overridden by drugs known to elevate intracellular free [Ca2+]. Our results provide the basis for investigations of genetic mechanisms underlying the observed phenomenon, and we discuss the potential implications of this work for Drosophila neurogenesis but also for a general understanding of GAD regulation.",2003,"Natalia Sánchez-Soriano, Gerhard M Technau, Andreas Prokop, Barbara Küppers, Johannes Letzkus"
"Development of the Drosophila mushroom bodies: elaboration, remodeling and spatial organization of dendrites in the calyx",12736205,10.1242/dev.00466,"One Drosophila mushroom body (MB) is derived from four indistinguishable cell lineages, development of which involves sequential generation of multiple distinct types of neurons. Differential labeling of distinct MB clones reveals that MB dendrites of different clonal origins are well mixed at the larval stage but become restricted to distinct spaces in adults. Interestingly, a small dendritic domain in the adult MB calyx remains as a fourfold structure that, similar to the entire larval calyx, receives dendritic inputs from all four MB clones. Mosaic analysis of single neurons demonstrates that MB neurons, which are born around pupal formation, acquire unique dendritic branching patterns and consistently project their primary dendrites into the fourfold dendritic domain. Distinct dendrite distribution patterns are also observed for other subtypes of MB neurons. In addition, pruning of larval dendrites during metamorphosis allows for establishment of adult-specific dendrite elaboration/distribution patterns. Taken together, subregional differences exist in the adult Drosophila MB calyx, where processing and integration of distinct types of sensory information begin.",2003,"Ann-Shyn Chiang, Sijun Zhu, Tzumin Lee"
Modifiers of muscle and heart cell fate specification identified by gain-of-function screen in Drosophila,14550529,10.1016/s0925-4773(03)00182-5,"The homeobox genes ladybird in Drosophila and their vertebrate counterparts Lbx1 genes display restricted expression patterns in a subset of muscle precursors and are both implicated in diversification of muscle cell fates. In order to gain new insights into mechanisms controlling conserved aspects of cell fate specification, we have performed a gain-of-function (GOF) screen for modifiers of the mesodermal expression of ladybird genes using a collection of EP element carrying Drosophila lines. Amongst the identified genes, several have been previously implicated in cell fate specification processes, thus validating the strategy of our screen. Observed GOF phenotypes have led us to identification of an important number of candidate genes, whose myogenic and/or cardiogenic functions remain to be investigated. Amongst them, the EP insertions close to rhomboid, yan and rac2 suggest new roles for these genes in diversification of muscle and/or heart cell lineages. The analysis of loss and GOF of rhomboid and yan reveals their new roles in specification of ladybird-expressing precursors of adult muscles (LaPs) and ladybird/tinman-positive pericardial cells. Observed phenotypes strongly suggest that rhomboid and yan act at the level of progenitor and founder cells and contribute to the diversification of mesodermal fates. Our analysis of rac2 phenotypes clearly demonstrates that the altered mesodermal level of Rho-GTPase Rac2 can influence specification of a number of cardiac and muscular cell types including those expressing ladybird. Finding that in rac2 mutants ladybird and even skipped-positive muscle founders are overproduced, indicate a new early function for this gene during segregation of muscle progenitors and/or specification of founder cells. Intriguingly, rhomboid, yan and rac2 act as conserved components of Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs) signalling pathways, suggesting that RTK signalling constitutes a part of a conserved regulatory network governing diversification of muscle and heart cell types.",2003,"Teresa Jagla, Bernard Dastugue, Yannick Bidet, Krzysztof Jagla, Jean-Philippe Da Ponte"
Induction of string rescues the neuroblast proliferation defect in trol mutant animals,12929089,10.1002/gene.10216,"In trol mutants, neuroblasts fail to exit G1 for S phase. Increasing string expression in trol mutants rescues the number of S phase neuroblasts without an increase in M phase neuroblasts.

Unlike cyclin E, cdk2, and cdk2AF, elevated expression of neither cyclin A, cyclin D, nor cdk1AF was able to promote S phase progression in arrested neuroblasts, indicating that String-induced activity of a Cyclin A or Cyclin D complex is unlikely to drive trol neuroblasts into S phase. Biochemical analyses revealed a rapid increase of Cyclin E-Cdk2 kinase activity to wild-type levels upon increased string expression.

As proof of concept supporting this technology, we identified 11 insertions in typical virulence genes such as those coding for pili implicated in motility, attachment and swarming, alginate synthesis and its expression, a mucus transcription regulator, extracellular enzymes such as alkaline protease, esterase and amino peptidase, a rhamnosyl surfactant transferase and a lipopolysaccharide glycosyl transferase. Detailed analysis of the 148 STM mutants, including seven auxotrophs, revealed insertions in 21 of the 26 known gene classes used to characterize sequenced bacterial genomes. We noted that at least 46% of STM mutants identified had insertions in hypothetical proteins or proteins of unknown function and that approximately 40% of all STM mutants had insertions in surface proteins including the outer membrane, the periplasm and the inner membrane. Interestingly, 11 STM mutants attenuated for lung infection were also identified in microarray and transcriptome for quorum sensing and mucoidy production. The remaining 130 mutants were systematically analysed for their capability to express fully known virulence factors. In addition, testing the ability of these mutants to infect alternative model host Drosophila melanogaster revealed 36 STM mutants defective in protease, twitching motility, swimming and swarming. Finally, we identified many genes, the activity of which in respiratory infection was not fully appreciated.",2003,"Eric Potvin, Dario E Lehoux, Gee W Lau, François Sanschagrin, Karine L Richard, Roger C Levesque, Irena Kukavica-Ibrulj"
Sply regulation of sphingolipid signaling molecules is essential for Drosophila development,12702658,10.1242/dev.00456,"Sphingosine-1-phosphate is a sphingolipid metabolite that regulates cell proliferation, migration and apoptosis through specific signaling pathways. Sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase catalyzes the conversion of sphingosine-1-phosphate to ethanolamine phosphate and a fatty aldehyde. We report the cloning of the Drosophila sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase gene (Sply) and demonstrate its importance for adult muscle development and integrity, reproduction and larval viability. Sply expression is temporally regulated, with onset of expression during mid-embryogenesis. Sply null mutants accumulate both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated sphingoid bases and exhibit semi-lethality, increased apoptosis in developing embryos, diminished egg-laying, and gross pattern abnormalities in dorsal longitudinal flight muscles. These defects are corrected by restoring Sply expression or by introduction of a suppressor mutation that diminishes sphingolipid synthesis and accumulation of sphingolipid intermediates. This is the first demonstration of novel and complex developmental pathologies directly linked to a disruption of sphingolipid catabolism in metazoans.",2003,"Deron R Herr, Julie D Saba, Rana Georges, Henrik Fyrst, Greg L Harris, Van Phan, Karie Heinecke"
Optimizing Drosophila olfactory learning with a semi-automated training device,20153774,10.1016/j.jneumeth.2010.02.007,"Drosophila olfactory aversive conditioning has served as a powerful model system with which to elucidate the molecular and neuronal mechanisms underlying memory formation. In the typical protocol, flies are exposed to a constant odor stream while receiving a pulsed electric shock in the conditioning tube of a manual apparatus. We have devised a simple, low-cost semi-automated conditioning apparatus that computationally controls the delivery of odor and shock. A semiconductor-based odor sensor is employed to monitor the change of odor concentration in the training tube. The system thus allows electric shocks to be precisely matched with odor concentration in the training tube. We found that short-term memory performance was improved with a pulsed odor flow protocol, in which odor is presented in short pulses, each paired with electric shock, rather than as a constant flow. The effect of pulsed odor flow might be ascribed to the phenomenon of 'conditioned approach', where approach toward an odor is induced when the electric shock is presented before odor pulse ends. Our data shows that the system is applicable to the study of olfactory memory formation and to the examination of conditioning parameters at a level of detail not practical with a manual apparatus.",2010,"Sam Kunes, Brendan Zagaeski, Yuko Maeyama, Tetsuya Tabata, Satoshi Murakami, Chuntao Dan"
"KeaA, a Dictyostelium Kelch-domain protein that regulates the response to stress and development",20670432,10.1186/1471-213X-10-79,"Background: The protein kinase YakA is responsible for the growth arrest and induction of developmental processes that occur upon starvation of Dictyostelium cells. yakA- cells are aggregation deficient, have a faster cell cycle and are hypersensitive to oxidative and nitrosoative stress. With the aim of isolating members of the YakA pathway, suppressors of the death induced by nitrosoative stress in the yakA- cells were identified. One of the suppressor mutations occurred in keaA, a gene identical to DG1106 and similar to Keap1 from mice and the Kelch protein from Drosophila, among others that contain Kelch domains. Results: A mutation in keaA suppresses the hypersensitivity to oxidative and nitrosoative stresses but not the faster growth phenotype of yakA- cells. The growth profile of keaA deficient cells indicates that this gene is necessary for growth. keaA deficient cells are more resistant to nitrosoative and oxidative stress and keaA is necessary for the production and detection of cAMP. A morphological analysis of keaA deficient cells during multicellular development indicated that, although the mutant is not absolutely deficient in aggregation, cells do not efficiently participate in the process. Gene expression analysis using cDNA microarrays of wild-type and keaA deficient cells indicated a role for KeaA in the regulation of the cell cycle and pre-starvation responses. Conclusions: KeaA is required for cAMP signaling following stress. Our studies indicate a role for kelch proteins in the signaling that regulates the cell cycle and development in response to changes in the environmental conditions.",2010,"Luciana Mantzouranis, Raquel Bagattini, Glaucia M Souza"
The role of Drosophila hyperplastic discs gene in spermatogenesis,20604743,10.1042/CBI20100105,"In Drosophila, the ubiquitin ligase Hyd (hyperplastic disc) is required for regulation of cell proliferation during development [Martin et al.

Earlier, we demonstrated that the Drosophila tumour suppressor Merlin participates not only in imaginal discs proliferation control, but also performs a separate Nebenkern structural function in Drosophila spermatogenesis [Dorogova et al. (2008) BMC Cell Biol 9, 1. Here, we show that the hyd mutants also have spermatogenesis defects: chromosome condensation and attachment to the spindle, centrosome behaviour and cytokinesis in meiosis. The process of spermatid elongation was also greatly affected: nuclei were scattered along the cyst and had an abnormal shape, Nebenkern-axoneme angular relation and attachment was distorted, axonemes themselves lost correct structure. Since Hyd and pAbp protein families share a common PABC [poly(A)-binding protein C-terminal] protein domain, we also studied spermatogenesis in pAbp homozygotes and found defects in cytokinesis and spermatid elongation. However, our study of hyd and pAbp genetic interaction revealed only the phenotype of defective nuclei shape at the final stage of spermatid differentiation. So, the PABC domain is unlikely to be responsible for meiotic defects. Thus, our data document that, in addition to the tumour suppressor Merlin, another tumour suppressor, Hyd, also has a function in spermatogenesis.",2010,"Julia A Pertceva, Olga O Nerusheva, Natalia V Dorogova, Leonid V Omelyanchuk, Elena U Bolobolova, Svetlana A Fedorova"
Modeling the evolution of regulatory elements by simultaneous detection and alignment with phylogenetic pair HMMs,21187896,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001037,"The computational detection of regulatory elements in DNA is a difficult but important problem impacting our progress in understanding the complex nature of eukaryotic gene regulation. Attempts to utilize cross-species conservation for this task have been hampered both by evolutionary changes of functional sites and poor performance of general-purpose alignment programs when applied to non-coding sequence. We describe a new and flexible framework for modeling binding site evolution in multiple related genomes, based on phylogenetic pair hidden Markov models which explicitly model the gain and loss of binding sites along a phylogeny. We demonstrate the value of this framework for both the alignment of regulatory regions and the inference of precise binding-site locations within those regions. As the underlying formalism is a stochastic, generative model, it can also be used to simulate the evolution of regulatory elements. Our implementation is scalable in terms of numbers of species and sequence lengths and can produce alignments and binding-site predictions with accuracy rivaling or exceeding current systems that specialize in only alignment or only binding-site prediction. We demonstrate the validity and power of various model components on extensive simulations of realistic sequence data and apply a specific model to study Drosophila enhancers in as many as ten related genomes and in the presence of gain and loss of binding sites. Different models and modeling assumptions can be easily specified, thus providing an invaluable tool for the exploration of biological hypotheses that can drive improvements in our understanding of the mechanisms and evolution of gene regulation.",2010,"William H Majoros, Uwe Ohler"
dFezf/Earmuff maintains the restricted developmental potential of intermediate neural progenitors in Drosophila,20152183,10.1016/j.devcel.2009.12.007,"To ensure normal development and maintenance of homeostasis, the extensive developmental potential of stem cells must be functionally distinguished from the limited developmental potential of transit amplifying cells. Yet the mechanisms that restrict the developmental potential of transit amplifying cells are poorly understood. Here we show that the evolutionarily conserved transcription factor dFezf/Earmuff (Erm) functions cell-autonomously to maintain the restricted developmental potential of the intermediate neural progenitors generated by type II neuroblasts in Drosophila larval brains. Although erm mutant intermediate neural progenitors are correctly specified and show normal apical-basal cortical polarity, they can dedifferentiate back into a neuroblast state, functionally indistinguishable from normal type II neuroblasts. Erm restricts the potential of intermediate neural progenitors by activating Prospero to limit proliferation and by antagonizing Notch signaling to prevent dedifferentiation. We conclude that Erm dependence functionally distinguishes intermediate neural progenitors from neuroblasts in the Drosophila larval brain, balancing neurogenesis with stem cell maintenance.",2010,"Mo Weng, Cheng-Yu Lee, Krista L Golden"
Oncogenic Ras diverts a host TNF tumor suppressor activity into tumor promoter,20627081,10.1016/j.devcel.2010.05.014,"The roles of inflammatory cytokines and the immune response in cancer remain paradoxical. In the case of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), there is undisputed evidence indicating both protumor and antitumor activities. Recent work in Drosophila indicated that a TNF-dependent mechanism eliminates cells deficient for the polarity tumor suppressors dlg or scrib. In this study, however, we show that in tumors deficient for scrib that also expressed the Ras oncoprotein, the TNF signal was diverted into a protumor signal that enhanced tumor growth through larval arrest and stimulated invasive migration. In this case, TNF promoted malignancy and was detrimental to host survival. TNF was expressed at high levels by tumor-associated hemocytes recruited from the circulation. The expression of TNF by hemocytes was both necessary and sufficient to trigger TNF signaling in tumor cells. Our evidence suggests that tumors can evolve into malignancy through oncogenic Ras activation and the hijacking of TNF signaling.",2010,"Julia B Cordero, Karen E Strathdee, Marcos Vidal, Juan P Macagno, Rhoda K Stefanatos, Ross L Cagan"

Neuronal expression of Mgat1 rescues the shortened life span of Drosophila Mgat11 null mutants and increases life span,20457894,10.1073/pnas.1004431107,"The enzyme UDP-GlcNAc:alpha3-D-mannoside beta1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (GnT1, encoded by Mgat1) controls the synthesis of paucimannose N-glycans in Drosophila. We have previously reported that null mutations in Drosophila Mgat1 are viable but exhibit defects in locomotion, brain abnormalities, and a severely reduced life span. Here, we show that knockdown of Mgat1 in the central nervous system (CNS) of wild-type flies decreases locomotor activity and life span. This phenotype is similar to that observed in Drosophila Mgat1(1) null mutants, demonstrating that Mgat1 is required in the CNS. We also found that neuronal expression of a wild-type Mgat1 transgene rescued the shortened life span of Mgat1(1) null mutants and resulted in a dramatic 135% increase in mean life span relative to genetically identical controls. Neuronal expression of a wild-type Mgat1 transgene in wild-type flies resulted in a modest 9% increase in mean life span relative to genetically identical controls. In both Mgat1(1) null mutants and wild-type flies, neuronal expression of wild-type Mgat1 transgene resulted in a significant increase in GnT1 activity and resistance to oxidative stress. Whereas dietary restriction is not absolutely essential for the increased life span, it plays a role in the process. Interestingly, we observe a direct correlation between GnT1 activity and mean life span up to a maximum of appropriately 136 days, showing that the ability of GnT1 activity to increase life span is limited. Altogether, these observations suggest that Mgat1-dependent N-glycosylation plays an important role in the control of Drosophila life span.",2010,"Harry Schachter, Gabrielle L Boulianne, Mohan Sarkar, Konstantin G Iliadi, Peter A Leventis"
Detachment of the basal body from the sperm tail is not required to organize functional centrosomes during Drosophila embryogenesis,20198700,10.1002/cm.20440,"The formation of the zygotic spindle at fertilization requires in most animals the central contribution of the sperm-inherited basal body that recruits maternal cytoplasmic components to assemble a functional centrosome. Although as a general rule the entire sperm enters the egg during fertilization, the fate of the sperm basal body during further development is not clear. We have found that the sperm centriole remains linked to the apical end of the sperm tail through early development and is able to duplicate and recruit maternal components to assemble functional centrosomes. The basal body, therefore, needs not to be detached from the sperm tail to perform its centriole function during organization of the centrosome. By cellularization and early gastrulation the sperm centriole has lost both these capabilities. The persistence of the sperm axoneme and its close association with its centriole during development presents a paradox. If the sperm centriole is a true basal body, then the widespread idea that cells with a primary cilium must resorb the axoneme and transform the basal body into a centriole to enable proper mitosis will have to be re-examined.",2010,"Giuliano Callaini, Maria Giovanna Riparbelli"
Analysis of candidate genes for macular telangiectasia type 2,21179236,,"Purpose: To find the gene(s) responsible for macular telangiectasia type 2 (MacTel) by a candidate-gene screening approach. Methods: Candidate genes were selected based on the following criteria: those known to cause or be associated with diseases with phenotypes similar to MacTel, genes with known function in the retinal vasculature or macular pigment transport, genes that emerged from expression microarray data from mouse models designed to mimic MacTel phenotype characteristics, and genes expressed in the retina that are also related to diabetes or hypertension, which have increased prevalence in MacTel patients. Probands from eight families with at least two affected individuals were screened by direct sequencing of 27 candidate genes. Identified nonsynonymous variants were analyzed to determine whether they co-segregate with the disease in families. Allele frequencies were determined by TaqMan analysis of the large MacTel and control cohorts. Results: We identified 23 nonsynonymous variants in 27 candidate genes in at least one proband. Of these, eight were known single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with allele frequencies of >0.05; these variants were excluded from further analyses. Three previously unidentified missense variants, three missense variants with reported disease association, and five rare variants were analyzed for segregation and/or allele frequencies. No variant fulfilled the criteria of being causal for MacTel. A missense mutation, p.Pro33Ser in frizzled homolog (Drosophila) 4 (FZD4), previously suggested as a disease-causing variant in familial exudative vitreoretinopathy, was determined to be a rare benign polymorphism.

Loss of twf function results in defects in axonal growth in the brain and border cell migration in the ovary. Additionally, we found that the actin-dependent postsynaptic localization of glutamate receptor GluRIIA, but not GluRIIB, was specifically reduced in twf mutants. More importantly, we showed that twf mutations caused significantly reduced presynaptic endocytosis at NMJ synapses, as detected using the fluorescent dye FM1-43 uptake assay. Furthermore, electrophysiological analysis under high-frequency stimulation showed compromised neurotransmission in twf mutant synapses, confirming an insufficient replenishment of synaptic vesicles.

Specific roles of Target of rapamycin in the control of stem cells and their progeny in the Drosophila ovary,20504961,10.1242/dev.050351,"Stem cells depend on intrinsic and local factors to maintain their identity and activity, but they also sense and respond to changing external conditions. We previously showed that germline stem cells (GSCs) and follicle stem cells (FSCs) in the Drosophila ovary respond to diet via insulin signals. Insulin signals directly modulate the GSC cell cycle at the G2 phase, but additional unknown dietary mediators control both G1 and G2. Target of rapamycin, or TOR, is part of a highly conserved nutrient-sensing pathway affecting growth, proliferation, survival and fertility. Here, we show that optimal TOR activity maintains GSCs but does not play a major role in FSC maintenance, suggesting differential regulation of GSCs versus FSCs. TOR promotes GSC proliferation via G2 but independently of insulin signaling, and TOR is required for the proliferation, growth and survival of differentiating germ cells. We also report that TOR controls the proliferation of FSCs but not of their differentiating progeny. Instead, TOR controls follicle cell number by promoting survival, independently of either the apoptotic or autophagic pathways.

The Drosophila female germline stem cell lineage acts to spatially restrict DPP function within the niche,20664066,10.1126/scisignal.2000740,"Maintenance of stem cells requires spatially restricted, niche-associated signals. In the Drosophila female germline stem cell (GSC) niche, Decapentaplegic (DPP) is the primary niche-associated factor and functions over a short range to promote GSC self-renewal rather than differentiation. Here, we show that the GSC lineage and, more specifically, the stem cells themselves participate in the spatial restriction of DPP function by activating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling in the surrounding somatic cells. EGFR-MAPK signaling in somatic cells repressed the expression of dally, which encodes a glypican required for DPP movement and stability. Consequently, only GSCs close to the DPP source (the somatic cells in the niche) showed high signal activation and were maintained as stem cells, whereas cystoblasts outside the niche showed low signal activation and initiated differentiation. Thus, our data reveal that the reciprocal crosstalk between the GSCs and the somatic cells defines the spatial limits of DPP action and therefore the extent of the GSC niche.",2010,"Tit Meng Lim, Ming Liu, Yu Cai"
Single sensillum recordings in the insects Drosophila melanogaster and Anopheles gambiae,20164822,10.3791/1725,"The sense of smell is essential for insects to find foods, mates, predators, and oviposition sites. Insect olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) are enclosed in sensory hairs called sensilla, which cover the surface of olfactory organs. The surface of each sensillum is covered with tiny pores, through which odorants pass and dissolve in a fluid called sensillum lymph, which bathes the sensory dendrites of the OSNs housed in a given sensillum. The OSN dendrites express odorant receptor (OR) proteins, which in insects function as odor-gated ion channels. The interaction of odorants with ORs either increases or decreases the basal firing rate of the OSN. This neuronal activity in the form of action potentials embodies the first representation of the quality, intensity, and temporal characteristics of the odorant. Given the easy access to these sensory hairs, it is possible to perform extracellular recordings from single OSNs by introducing a recording electrode into the sensillum lymph, while the reference electrode is placed in the lymph of the eye or body of the insect. In Drosophila, sensilla house between one and four OSNs, but each OSN typically displays a characteristic spike amplitude. Spike sorting techniques make it possible to assign spiking responses to individual OSNs. This single sensillum recording (SSR) technique monitors the difference in potential between the sensillum lymph and the reference electrode as electrical spikes that are generated by the receptor activity on OSNs. Changes in the number of spikes in response to the odorant represent the cellular basis of odor coding in insects. Here, we describe the preparation method currently used in our lab to perform SSR on Drosophila melanogaster and Anopheles gambiae, and show representative traces induced by the odorants in a sensillum-specific manner.",2010,"Leslie B Vosshall, Maurizio Pellegrino, Takao Nakagawa"

We find that HFD-fed flies exhibit increased triglyceride (TG) fat and alterations in insulin/glucose homeostasis, similar to mammalian responses. A HFD also causes cardiac lipid accumulation, reduced cardiac contractility, conduction blocks, and severe structural pathologies, reminiscent of diabetic cardiomyopathies. Remarkably, these metabolic and cardiotoxic phenotypes elicited by HFD are blocked by inhibiting insulin-TOR signaling. Moreover, reducing insulin-TOR activity (by expressing TSC1-2, 4EBP or FOXO), or increasing lipase expression-only within the myocardium-suffices to efficiently alleviate cardiac fat accumulation and dysfunction induced by HFD. We conclude that deregulation of insulin-TOR signaling due to a HFD is responsible for mediating the detrimental effects on metabolism and heart function.",2010,"Ryan T Birse, Joan Choi, Sean Oldham, Karen Ocorr, Suzanne Graham, Kathryn Reardon, Rolf Bodmer, Jessica Rodriguez, Soda Diop"
Transcriptional interactions between the pannier isoforms and the cofactor U-shaped during neural development in Drosophila,20709169,10.1016/j.mod.2010.08.002,"The pannier (pnr) gene of Drosophila melanogaster encodes two isoforms that belong to the family of GATA transcription factors. The isoforms share an expression domain in the wing discs where they exhibit distinct functions during regulation of the proneural achaete/scute (ac/sc) genes. We previously identified two regions in the pnr locus that drive reporter expression in transgenic lines in patterns that recapitulate the essential features of expression of the two isoforms. Here, we identify promoter regions driving isoform expression, showing that pnr-α regulatory sequences are close to the transcription start site while pnr-β expression requires functional interactions between proximal and distal regulatory elements. We find that the promoter domains necessary for reporter expression also mediate autoregulation of Pnr-β and repression of pnr-α by Pnr-β. The cofactor U-shaped (Ush), which is known to down-regulate the function of Pnr during thorax patterning postranscriptionally, in addition represses pnr-β required for ac/sc activation. Moreover, Ush negatively regulates its own expression, while the pnr isoforms positively regulate ush. Our study uncovers complex transcriptional interactions between the pnr isoforms and the cofactor Ush that may be important for regulation of proneural expression and thorax patterning.",2010,"Nathalie Taquet, Philippe Ramain, Catherine Fromental-Ramain"
Structural analysis of HMGD-DNA complexes reveals influence of intercalation on sequence selectivity and DNA bending,20800069,10.1016/j.jmb.2010.08.031,"The ubiquitous, eukaryotic, high-mobility group box (HMGB) chromosomal proteins promote many chromatin-mediated cellular activities through their non-sequence-specific binding and bending of DNA. Minor-groove DNA binding by the HMG box results in substantial DNA bending toward the major groove owing to electrostatic interactions, shape complementarity, and DNA intercalation that occurs at two sites. Here, the structures of the complexes formed with DNA by a partially DNA intercalation-deficient mutant of Drosophila melanogaster HMGD have been determined by X-ray crystallography at a resolution of 2.85 Å. The six proteins and 50 bp of DNA in the crystal structure revealed a variety of bound conformations. All of the proteins bound in the minor groove, bridging DNA molecules, presumably because these DNA regions are easily deformed. The loss of the primary site of DNA intercalation decreased overall DNA bending and shape complementarity. However, DNA bending at the secondary site of intercalation was retained and most protein-DNA contacts were preserved. The mode of binding resembles the HMGB1 box A-cisplatin-DNA complex, which also lacks a primary intercalating residue. This study provides new insights into the binding mechanisms used by HMG boxes to recognize varied DNA structures and sequences as well as modulate DNA structure and DNA bending.",2010,"Mair E A Churchill, Janet Klass, David L Zoetewey"

grim promotes programmed cell death of Drosophila microchaete glial cells,20558283,10.1016/j.mod.2010.06.001,"The Inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) antagonists Reaper (Rpr), Grim and Hid are central regulators of developmental apoptosis in Drosophila. Ectopic expression of each is sufficient to trigger apoptosis, and hid and rpr have been shown to be important for programmed cell death (PCD). To investigate the role for grim in PCD, a grim null mutant was generated. grim was not a key proapoptotic gene for embryonic PCD, confirming that grim cooperates with rpr and hid in embryogenesis. In contrast, PCD of glial cells in the microchaete lineage required grim, identifying a death process dependent upon endogenous grim. Grim associates with mitochondria and has been shown to activate a mitochondrial death pathway distinct from IAP antagonization; therefore, the Drosophila bcl-2 genes buffy and debcl were investigated for genetic interaction with grim. Loss of buffy led to microchaete glial cell survival and suppressed death in the eye induced by ectopic Grim. This is the first example of a developmental PCD process influenced by buffy, and places buffy in a proapoptotic role.

A complex small RNA repertoire is generated by a plant/fungal-like machinery and effected by a metazoan-like Argonaute in the single-cell human parasite Toxoplasma gondii,20523899,10.1371/journal.ppat.1000920,"In RNA silencing, small RNAs produced by the RNase-III Dicer guide Argonaute-like proteins as part of RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISC) to regulate gene expression transcriptionally or post-transcriptionally. Here, we have characterized the RNA silencing machinery and exhaustive small RNAome of Toxoplasma gondii, member of the Apicomplexa, a phylum of animal- and human-infecting parasites that cause extensive health and economic damages to human populations worldwide. Remarkably, the small RNA-generating machinery of Toxoplasma is phylogenetically and functionally related to that of plants and fungi, and accounts for an exceptionally diverse array of small RNAs. This array includes conspicuous populations of repeat-associated small interfering RNA (siRNA), which, as in plants, likely generate and maintain heterochromatin at DNA repeats and satellites. Toxoplasma small RNAs also include many microRNAs with clear metazoan-like features whose accumulation is sometimes extremely high and dynamic, an unexpected finding given that Toxoplasma is a unicellular protist. Both plant-like heterochromatic small RNAs and metazoan-like microRNAs bind to a single Argonaute protein, Tg-AGO. Toxoplasma miRNAs co-sediment with polyribosomes, and thus, are likely to act as translational regulators, consistent with the lack of catalytic residues in Tg-AGO. Mass spectrometric analyses of the Tg-AGO protein complex revealed a common set of virtually all known RISC components so far characterized in human and Drosophila, as well as novel proteins involved in RNA metabolism. In agreement with its loading with heterochromatic small RNAs, Tg-AGO also associates substoichiometrically with components of known chromatin-repressing complexes. Thus, a puzzling patchwork of silencing processor and effector proteins from plant, fungal and metazoan origin accounts for the production and action of an unsuspected variety of small RNAs in the single-cell parasite Toxoplasma and possibly in other apicomplexans.

Here we show that mutations in morgana/chp-1 result in centrosome amplification and lethality in both Drosophila and mouse, and that the fly centrosome phenotype is fully rescued by the human ortholog of morgana. In mouse cells, morgana forms a complex with Hsp90 and ROCK I and II, and directly binds ROCK II. Morgana downregulation promotes the interaction between ROCK II and nucleophosmin (NPM), leading to an increased ROCK II kinase activity, which results in centrosome amplification. Morgana(+/-) primary cells and mice display an increased susceptibility to neoplastic transformation.

Proproliferative functions of Drosophila small mitochondrial heat shock protein 22 in human cells,19948727,10.1074/jbc.M109.080424,"Aging is a complex process accompanied by a decreased capacity of cells to cope with random damages induced by reactive oxygen species, the natural by-products of energy metabolism, leading to protein aggregation in various components of the cell. Chaperones are important players in the aging process as they prevent protein misfolding and aggregation. Small chaperones, such as small heat shock proteins, are involved in the refolding and/or disposal of protein aggregates, a feature of many age-associated diseases. In Drosophila melanogaster, mitochondrial Hsp22 (DmHsp22), is localized in the mitochondrial matrix and is preferentially up-regulated during aging. Its overexpression results in an extension of life span (>30%) (Morrow, G., Samson, M., Michaud, S., and Tanguay, R. M.

Long lived flies expressing Hsp22 also have an increased resistance to oxidative stress and maintain locomotor activity longer. In the present study, the cross-species effects of Hsp22 expression were tested. DmHsp22 was found to be functionally active in human cells. It extended the life span of normal fibroblasts, slowing the aging process as evidenced by a lower level of the senescence associated beta-galactosidase. DmHsp22 expression in human cancer cells increased their malignant properties including anchorage-independent growth, tumor formation in nude mice, and resistance to a variety of anticancer drugs. We report that the DmHsp22 interacts and inactivates wild type tumor suppressor protein p53, which may be one possible way of its functioning in human cells.",2010,"Inwook Kim, Robert M Tanguay, Jihoon Ryu, Sunil C Kaul, Il-Kyu Choi, Chae-Ok Yun, Geneviève Morrow, Renu Wadhwa, Ran Gao, Kamaljit Kaur"
"Object preference by walking fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster, is mediated by vision and graviperception",20581279,10.1242/jeb.041749,"Walking fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster, use visual information to orient towards salient objects in their environment, presumably as a search strategy for finding food, shelter or other resources. Less is known, however, about the role of vision or other sensory modalities such as mechanoreception in the evaluation of objects once they have been reached. To study the role of vision and mechanoreception in exploration behavior, we developed a large arena in which we could track individual fruit flies as they walked through either simple or more topologically complex landscapes. When exploring a simple, flat environment lacking three-dimensional objects, flies used visual cues from the distant background to stabilize their walking trajectories. When exploring an arena containing an array of cones, differing in geometry, flies actively oriented towards, climbed onto, and explored the objects, spending most of their time on the tallest, steepest object. A fly's behavioral response to the geometry of an object depended upon the intrinsic properties of each object and not a relative assessment to other nearby objects. Furthermore, the preference was not due to a greater attraction towards tall, steep objects, but rather a change in locomotor behavior once a fly reached and explored the surface. Specifically, flies are much more likely to stop walking for long periods when they are perched on tall, steep objects. Both the vision system and the antennal chordotonal organs (Johnston's organs) provide sufficient information about the geometry of an object to elicit the observed change in locomotor behavior. Only when both these sensory systems were impaired did flies not show the behavioral preference for the tall, steep objects.",2010,"Michael H Dickinson, Andrew D Straw, Alice A Robie"
Identification and expression profile of Halloween genes involved in ecdysteroid biosynthesis in Spodoptera littoralis,19682519,10.1016/j.peptides.2009.08.002,"20-Hydroxyecdyone (20E), an active form of ecdysteroid, is the key hormone in insect growth and development. The biosynthesis of ecdysteroid is triggered and under the control of the neuropeptide, prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH). To date, five cytochrome P450 enzymes, namely Spook (Spo), Phantom (Phm), Disembodied (Dib), Shadow (Sad) and Shade (Shd) related to ecdysteroid biosynthesis, are identified and the character of last four enzymes is well studied in Drosophila melanogaster, Bombyx mori and Manduca sexta. These genes are called Halloween genes and mediate the biosynthesis of 20E from cholesterol. In this study, we extended these works to a major pest insect in agriculture, the cotton leafworm Spodoptera littoralis (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). We identified the sequence of five Halloween genes, and the converted amino acid sequences were compared with those of other insects. The phylogenetic analysis clearly showed separated clusters of each gene and the evolutional conservation in insects with a high similarity in Lepidoptera. Spo, phm, dib and sad were predominantly expressed in prothoracic glands, and shd was expressed in fat body and Malpighian tubules at the last instar larvae. Spo expression was kept high level between day 2 and day 4 after ecdysis. The expression of phm and dib peaked at day 2, and sad and shd expressions peaked at day 2 and day 4 after ecdysis. In addition, the hemolymph ecdysteroid titer showed a small peak at day 2 and a large peak at day 4 after ecdysis. These results suggest the importance of Halloween genes in ecdysone biosynthesis by prothoracic glands and conversion of ecdysone into 20E by fat body in larval-pupal metamorphosis.",2010,"Guy Smagghe, Masatoshi Iga"

However, the molecular basis of this mechanism and the physiological functions of P450s associated with insecticide resistance remain largely unknown. Here, we exploited the functional genomics and reverse genetic approaches to identify and characterize a P450 gene responsible for the majority of deltamethrin resistance observed in the QTC279 strain of Tribolium castaneum. We used recently completed whole-genome sequence of T. castaneum to prepare custom microarrays and identified a P450 gene, CYP6BQ9, which showed more than a 200-fold higher expression in the deltamethrin-resistant QTC279 strain when compared with its expression in the deltamethrin-susceptible Lab-S strain. Functional studies using both double-strand RNA (dsRNA)-mediated knockdown in the expression of CYP6BQ9 and transgenic expression of CYP6BQ9 in Drosophila melanogaster showed that CYP6BQ9 confers deltamethrin resistance. Furthermore, CYP6BQ9 enzyme expressed in baculovirus metabolizes deltamethrin to 4-hydroxy deltamethrin. Strikingly, we also found that unlike many P450 genes involved in insecticide resistance that were reported previously, CYP6BQ9 is predominantly expressed in the brain, a part of the central nervous system (CNS) containing voltage-gated sodium channels targeted by deltamethrin. Taken together, the current studies on the brain-specific insect P450 involved in deltamethrin resistance shed new light on the understanding of the molecular basis and evolution of insecticide resistance.",2010,"Fang Zhu, R Parthasarathy, Martin Kaussmann, Katharina Woithe, Subba R Palli, Hua Bai, Ralf Nauen, Douglas A Harrison"
Joint effects of density dependence and toxicant exposure on Drosophila melanogaster populations,17658601,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2007.05.020,"Risk assessment of environmental contaminants is usually based on experiments on well-fed individuals held at low population densities. However, field populations are often subject to resource limitation. Individuals who are already stressed by crowding or food limitation may show greater susceptibility to toxicants. But density dependence could also reduce population-level impacts as toxicant-related mortalities may reduce competition for resources. This study examines the joint effects of toxicants and food availability on populations of Drosophila melanogaster. The interactions between the effects of food limitation and toxicant stress were dose dependent and strongly influenced by toxicity mechanisms. In food-limited conditions, a compensatory effect often occurred, with toxicant exposure having a lower proportional impact than at higher food levels. This provides further evidence that density-dependent population processes can produce an assimilative capacity for the effects of toxicants. But synergistic food-toxicant effects were also common and the interaction often switched between synergistic and compensatory at different toxicant concentrations and food supplies. There is no simple ""less-than-additive"", ""additive"" or ""more-than-additive"" relationship between density and toxicant effects, even for a single toxicant.",2008,"Yue Gui, Alastair Grant"

While considerable attention has focused on NF-kB-mediated antimicrobial activities, more recent studies have highlighted the involvement of JNK signaling in the Imd pathway response.

Biolistics for high-throughput transformation and RNA interference in Drosophila melanogaster,18838871,10.4161/fly.6985,"With twelve Drosophila genomes now sequenced, there is a growing need to develop higher-throughput methods for identifying the functions of the many newly identified genes. Genetic transformation and RNA interference are two technologies that have been used extensively to facilitate gene-function studies in Drosophila melanogaster, to introduce genes or block the expression of endogenous genes, respectively. Both of these technologies typically require the delivery of nucleic acids into developing insect embryos, and virtually all studies to date have relied on microinjection as the DNA delivery method of choice. In this study, we describe the use of biolistics as a higher-throughput method of nucleic acid delivery. By bombarding dechorionated D. melanogaster embryos with 1 microm gold beads coated with P-element or piggyBac transformation vectors, we observed transformation frequencies (3-4%) that are comparable to those achieved using microinjection methods, but in only a fraction of the time required for the DNA delivery. Biolistic delivery of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) specific to a beta-glucuronidase (gus) transgene resulted in a significant (71%) reduction in gus transcripts in embryos and the RNA interference (RNAi) persisted through two successive larval molts, albeit at reduced levels. DsRNAs specific to four essential genes were delivered to embryos and resulted in arrested development and phenotypes that closely match that of null mutations. These results suggest that biolistic delivery of dsRNA into embryos could be adapted for high throughput RNAi screens of early Drosophila developmental genes.",2008,"Scott A Read, John L Brubacher, Steven Whyard, Jenna L Yuen, Aditi D Singh"

In Drosophila, Fat represses fj transcription, and Ds represses Fat activity in PCP. Here we show that Fat4 is an essential gene that has a key role in vertebrate PCP. Loss of Fat4 disrupts oriented cell divisions and tubule elongation during kidney development, leading to cystic kidney disease. Fat4 genetically interacts with the PCP genes Vangl2 and Fjx1 in cyst formation. In addition, Fat4 represses Fjx1 expression, indicating that Fat signaling is conserved.

Functional characterization and subcellular localization of the 16K cysteine-rich suppressor of gene silencing protein of tobacco rattle virus,18559946,10.1099/vir.0.83503-0,"The 16 kDa cysteine-rich protein (16K) of tobacco rattle virus (TRV) is known to partially suppress RNA silencing in Drosophila cells. In this study, we show that 16K suppresses RNA silencing in green fluorescent protein (GFP)-transgenic Nicotiana benthamiana plants using an Agrobacterium-mediated transient assay. 16K slightly reduced the accumulation of short interfering RNAs (siRNA) of GFP, suggesting that the protein may interfere with the initiation and/or maintenance of RNA silencing. Deletion of either the N- or C-terminal part of 16K indicated that the entire 16K open reading frame (ORF) is necessary for its silencing suppression function. Pentapeptide insertion scanning mutagenesis (PSM) revealed that only two short regions of 16K tolerated five extra amino acid insertions without considerable reduction in its silencing suppression function. The tolerant regions coincide with sequence variability between tobravirus cysteine-rich proteins, indicating a strong functional and/or structural conservation of TRV 16K. Confocal laser scanning microscopy of transiently expressed 16K fusions to red fluorescent protein (RFP) revealed a predominant cytoplasmic localization and, in addition, a nuclear localization. In contrast, fusions of RFP with the N-terminal region of 16K localized exclusively to the cytoplasm, whereas fusions between RFP and the C-terminal region of 16K displayed an exclusive nuclear localization. Further analysis of 16K-derived peptide fusions demonstrated that the 16K C-terminal region contained at least two functional bipartite nuclear localization signals which were independently capable of nuclear targeting.",2008,"Angelika Waltermann, Mark Varrelmann, Walid Ghazala, Ruth Pilot, Stephan Winter"

"Evolution of a complex locus: exon gain, loss and divergence at the Gr39a locus in Drosophila",18231599,10.1371/journal.pone.0001513,"Background: Gene families typically evolve by gene duplication followed by the adoption of new or altered gene functions.

Alternative splicing has only rarely been reported in chemosensory loci, for example in 5 out of around 120 loci in Drosophila melanogaster. The gustatory receptor gene Gr39a has four large exons that are alternatively spliced with three small conserved exons. Recently the genome sequences of eleven additional species of Drosophila have become available allowing us to examine variation in the structure of the Gr39a locus across a wide phylogenetic range of fly species. Methodology/principal findings: We describe a fifth exon and show that the locus has a complex evolutionary history with several duplications, pseudogenisations and losses of exons. PAML analyses suggested that the whole gene has a history of purifying selection, although this was less strong in exons which underwent duplication.

Multifunctionality and robustness trade-offs in model genetic circuits,18367655,10.1529/biophysj.107.114348,"Most cellular systems, from macromolecules to genetic networks, have more than one function. Examples involving networks include the transcriptional regulation circuits formed by Hox genes and the Drosophila segmentation genes, which function in both early and later developmental events. Does the need to carry out more than one function severely constrain network architecture? Does it imply robustness trade-offs among functions? That is, if one function is highly robust to mutations, are other functions highly sensitive, and vice versa? Little available evidence speaks to these questions. We address them with a general model of transcriptional regulation networks. We show that requiring a regulatory network to carry out additional functions constrains the number of permissible network architectures exponentially. However, robustness of one function to regulatory mutations is uncorrelated or weakly positively correlated to robustness of other functions. This means that robustness trade-offs generally do not arise in the systems we study. As long as there are many alternative network structures, each of which can fulfill all required functions, multiple functions may acquire high robustness through gradual Darwinian evolution.",2008,"Andreas Wagner, Olivier C Martin"

In fly heads, cry upstream sequences drive constitutive expression in brain oscillator neurons, a novel group of nonoscillator cells in the optic lobe, and peripheral oscillator cells in eyes and antennae. In contrast, cry intron 1 drives rhythmic expression in eyes and antennae, but not brain oscillator neurons.

Exposure to decreased temperature (16 degrees C) caused a noticeable increase in the rate of asynapses of homologous chromosomes, whereas this effect was insignificant for F30 inbreeding generation. Long-term inbreeding has a substantial effect on the relative positions of chromosomes in the nurse cell nuclei.

Brm transactivates the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene and modulates the splicing patterns of its transcripts in concert with p54(nrb),18042045,10.1042/BJ20071075,"We report that a DBHS (Drosophila behaviour, human splicing) family protein, p54(nrb), binds both BRG1 (Brahma-related gene 1) and Brm (Brahma), catalytic subunits of the SWI/SNF (switch/sucrose non-fermentable) chromatin remodelling complex, and also another core subunit of this complex, BAF60a. The N-terminal region of p54(nrb) is sufficient to pull-down other core subunits of the SWI/SNF complex, suggesting that p54(nrb) binds SWI/SNF-like complexes. PSF (polypyrimidine tract-binding protein-associated splicing factor), another DBHS family protein known to directly bind p54(nrb), was also found to associate with the SWI/SNF-like complex. When sh (short hairpin) RNAs targeting Brm were retrovirally expressed in a BRG1-deficient human cell line (NCI-H1299), the resulting clones showed down-regulation of the TERT (telomerase reverse transcriptase) gene and an enhancement of ratios of exon-7-and-8-excluded TERT mRNA that encodes a beta-site-deleted inactive protein. All of these clones display growth arrest within 2 months of the Brm-knockdown. In NCI-H1299 cells, Brm, p54(nrb), PSF and RNA polymerase II phosphorylated on CTD (C-terminal domain) Ser(2) specifically co-localize at a region incorporating an alternative splicing acceptor site of TERT exon 7. These findings suggest that, at the TERT gene locus in human tumour cells containing a functional SWI/SNF complex, Brm, and possibly BRG1, in concert with p54(nrb), would initiate efficient transcription and could be involved in the subsequent splicing of TERT transcripts by accelerating exon-inclusion, which partly contributes to the maintenance of active telomerase.",2008,"Shuji Fujita, Toshio Tando, Toshiaki Isobe, Hideo Iba, Takeshi Haraguchi, Shunsuke Kondo, Nobutake Yamamichi, Tomonori Izumi, Kouhei Sakurai, Hirotaka Watanabe, Taiji Ito, Taketoshi Mizutani"

TBP recruitment to the U1 snRNA gene promoter is disrupted by substituting a U6 proximal sequence element A (PSEA) for the U1 PSEA,18547530,10.1016/j.febslet.2008.06.003,Transcription of Drosophila U1 or U6 snRNAs by RNA polymerases II and III respectively requires a unique approximately 21 base-pair promoter element termed the proximal sequence element A (PSEA) recognized by the snRNA activating protein complex (DmSNAPc).

Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicated this substitution did not affect DmSNAPc DNA binding but instead interfered with SNAPc recruitment of TBP to the TATA-less U1 promoter.

Degradation of functional triose phosphate isomerase protein underlies sugarkill pathology,18458110,10.1534/genetics.108.087551,"Triose phosphate isomerase (TPI) deficiency glycolytic enzymopathy is a progressive neurodegenerative condition that remains poorly understood. The disease is caused exclusively by specific missense mutations affecting the TPI protein and clinically features hemolytic anemia, adult-onset neurological impairment, degeneration, and reduced longevity. TPI has a well-characterized role in glycolysis, catalyzing the isomerization of dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P); however, little is known mechanistically about the pathogenesis associated with specific recessive mutations that cause progressive neurodegeneration. Here, we describe key aspects of TPI pathogenesis identified using the TPI(sugarkill) mutation, a Drosophila model of human TPI deficiency. Specifically, we demonstrate that the mutant protein is expressed, capable of forming a homodimer, and is functional. However, the mutant protein is degraded by the 20S proteasome core leading to loss-of-function pathogenesis.",2008,"Michael J Palladino, Jacquelyn L Seigle, Alicia M Celotto"
Enzyme isoforms may increase phenotypic robustness,18752604,10.1111/j.1558-5646.2008.00483.x,"Enzyme isoforms are found in many cellular reactions, and can differ in the kind of reaction they catalyze, in their substrate affinity, or in their reaction rates. The evolutionary significance of enzyme isoforms is only partially understood. We used mathematical modeling to investigate the hypothesis that isoforms may be favored by selection because they can increase the phenotypic robustness of the system. We modify a model for circadian clock gene expression in Drosophila to incorporate the presence of isoforms in the phosphorylation pathway of the period gene. We consider the case in which different isoforms catalyze the same reaction but have different affinities for the substrate. Stability is increased if there is dynamic control of the expression of isoforms relative to each other. Thus, we show that controlling isoform proportion can be a powerful mechanism for reducing the effects of variations in the values of system parameters, increasing system robustness.",2008,"David Houle, Maurizio Tomaiuolo, Richard Bertram"
The role of the antennae during courtship behaviour in the parasitic wasp Trichopria drosophilae,18626083,10.1242/jeb.013177,"We have studied the courtship behaviour of Trichopria drosophilae Perkins (Hymenoptera: Diapriidae), a pupal parasitoid of the common fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster Meigen (Diptera: Drosophilidae), to understand the role of the antennae. Virgin pairs of the parasitoid perform an intense and stereotyped antennal courtship, which leads to copulation. During antennation, the two male fourth antennomeres come into contact with the two apical female antennomeres, and thus the secretion produced by the sex pheromone gland is spread onto the female receptors. By preventing the transfer of the courtship pheromone from male to female antennae, mating was inhibited. Moreover, selective ablation of single antennae demonstrated that the courtship pheromone acts on contact. When antennae of both sexes were partially removed (ablation at the same side, i.e. right or left) courtship was successful and copulation occurred. In contrast, in the case of antennal ablation at opposite sides, courtship failed despite the short distance between secretion and receptors. These results confirm the hypothesis that T. drosophilae male antennal glands are the release site of a contact courtship pheromone, playing a key role in mating behaviour. The occurrence of male antennal glands in Hymenoptera and other insect orders is discussed.",2008,"Marzia Cristiana Rosi, Roberto Romani, Ferdinando Bin, Nunzio Isidoro"

Furthermore, the collagen type I induced byAGEs was down-regulated after inhibition of ERK and p38-MAPK, the collagen type III reduced by AGEs was up-regulated after inhibition of ERK. The expression of collagen types I and III regulated by AGEs through MAPK was partly reversed after treatment with TRB3 siRNA.

Drosophila pico and its mammalian ortholog lamellipodin activate serum response factor and promote cell proliferation,19000833,10.1016/j.devcel.2008.09.020,"MIG-10/RIAM/lamellipodin (MRL) proteins link activated Ras-GTPases with actin regulatory Ena/VASP proteins to induce local changes in cytoskeletal dynamics and cell motility. MRL proteins alter monomeric (G):filamentous (F) actin ratios, but the impact of these changes had not been fully appreciated. We report here that the Drosophila MRL ortholog, pico, is required for tissue and organismal growth. Reduction in pico levels resulted in reduced cell division rates, growth retardation, increased G:F actin ratios and lethality. Conversely, pico overexpression reduced G:F actin ratios and promoted tissue overgrowth in an epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR)-dependent manner. Consistently, in HeLa cells, lamellipodin was required for EGF-induced proliferation. We show that pico and lamellipodin share the ability to activate serum response factor (SRF), a transcription factor that responds to reduced G:F-actin ratios via its co-factor Mal. Genetics data indicate that mal/SRF levels are important for pico-mediated tissue growth.

The clockwork orange Drosophila protein functions as both an activator and a repressor of clock gene expression,18375860,10.1177/0748730407313817,"The Drosophila clock relies on transcriptional feedback loops that generate daily oscillations of the clock gene expression at mRNA and protein levels.

Posttranslational modifications delay the accumulation of PER and TIM, which inhibit CLK/CYC activity in the late night. We show here that a null mutant of the clockwork orange (cwo) gene encoding a bHLH orange-domain putative transcription factor displays long-period activity rhythms. cwo loss of function increases cwo mRNA levels but reduces mRNA peak levels of the 4 described CLK/CYC targets, inducing an almost complete loss of their cycling.

The segmentation mechanisms of insects and vertebrates have been seen as fundamentally different at the anatomical and molecular levels, and consequently, independently evolved. However, this conclusion was mostly based on observations of derived insects such as Drosophila. We have cloned the Delta, Notch, and hairy genes in the cockroach Periplaneta americana, a basal insect with short germ-band development, and carried out functional assays of Notch activity during its segmentation. Our results show that, in more basal insects, segmentation involves a similar developmental mechanism to that in vertebrates, including induction of segment formation by cyclic segmental stripes of hairy and Delta expression. This result indicates that Notch-mediated segmentation is the ancestral segmentation mechanism of insects, and together with previous results in the literature [Stollewerk A, Schoppmeier M, Damen WGM (2003) Nature 423:863-865], of arthropods as well.

Premature aging in mice activates a systemic metabolic response involving autophagy induction,18443001,10.1093/hmg/ddn120,"Autophagy is a highly regulated intracellular process involved in the turnover of most cellular constituents and in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. It is well-established that the basal autophagic activity of living cells decreases with age, thus contributing to the accumulation of damaged macromolecules during aging. Conversely, the activity of this catabolic pathway is required for lifespan extension in animal models such as Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster. In this work, we describe the unexpected finding that Zmpste24-null mice, which show accelerated aging and are a reliable model of human Hutchinson-Gilford progeria, exhibit an extensive basal activation of autophagy instead of the characteristic decline in this process occurring during normal aging. We also show that this autophagic increase is associated with a series of changes in lipid and glucose metabolic pathways, which resemble those occurring in diverse situations reported to prolong lifespan. These Zmpste24(-/-) mice metabolic alterations are also linked to substantial changes in circulating blood parameters, such as leptin, glucose, insulin or adiponectin which in turn lead to peripheral LKB1-AMPK activation and mTOR inhibition. On the basis of these results, we propose that nuclear abnormalities causing premature aging in Zmpste24(-/-) mice trigger a metabolic response involving the activation of autophagy. However, the chronic activation of this catabolic pathway may turn an originally intended pro-survival strategy into a pro-aging mechanism and could contribute to the systemic degeneration and weakening observed in these progeroid mice.",2008,"Alejandro P Ugalde, Ingrid van der Pluijm, Ignacio Varela, José M P Freije, Pedro M Quirós, Guillermo Mariño, Natalia Salvador-Montoliu, Juan Cadiñanos, Carlos López-Otín"

Light and peptidergic eclosion hormone neurons stimulate a rapid eclosion response that masks circadian emergence in Drosophila,18587121,10.1242/jeb.015818,"Light signals can entrain circadian clocks, but they can also mask aspects of the circadian output.

Flies that lack the neuropeptide eclosion hormone (EH), or in which its release is inhibited by the tetanus toxin light chain, lack the response. Optic photoreceptors in both the ocelli and the compound eyes appear to be required for the response. The LOn signal has two effects: (1) it drastically reduces the interval between EH release and eclosion, presumably by suppressing a transient descending inhibition that immediately follows EH release, and (2) it stimulates premature EH release.

"The Drosophila homolog of human tumor suppressor TSC-22 promotes cellular growth, proliferation, and survival",18375761,10.1073/pnas.0800945105,"TSC22D1, which encodes transforming growth factor beta-stimulated clone 22 (TSC-22), is thought to be a tumor suppressor because its expression is lost in many glioblastoma, salivary gland, and prostate cancers. TSC-22 is the founding member of the TSC-22/DIP/Bun family of leucine zipper transcription factors; its functions have not been investigated in a multicellular environment. Genetic studies in the model organism Drosophila melanogaster often provide fundamental insights into mechanisms disrupted in carcinogenesis, because of the strong evolutionary conservation of molecular mechanisms between flies and humans. Whereas humans and mice have four TSC-22 domain genes with numerous isoforms, Drosophila has only one TSC-22 domain gene, bunched (bun), which encodes both large and small protein isoforms. Surprisingly, Drosophila Bun proteins promote cellular growth and proliferation in ovarian follicle cells. Loss of both large isoforms has the strongest phenotypes, including increased apoptosis. Cultured S2 cells depleted for large Bun isoforms show increased apoptosis and less frequent cell division, with decreased cell size. Altogether, these data indicate that Drosophila TSC-22/DIP/Bun proteins are necessary for cellular growth, proliferation, and survival both in culture and in an epithelial context. Previous work demonstrated that bun prevents recruitment of epithelial cells to a migratory fate and, thus, maintains epithelial organization. We speculate that reduced TSC22D1 expression generally reduces cellular fitness and only contributes to carcinogenesis in specific tissue environments.",2008,"Megumu Yamada-Mabuchi, Nick J Dyson, Erick J Morris, Pradeep Singh Tanwar, Leonard Dobens, Silvia Gluderer, Sabina Khan, Ernst Hafen, Jing Cao, Xiaodong Wu, Hugo Stocker, Laurel A Raftery"

Thus, we can ask about the validity of this rule for a system containing several cells and with intercellular genetic interactions. In this paper, we consider the genetic interactions between several cells located on a d-dimensional lattice, i.e., each point of lattice represents a cell to which we associate the expression level of n genes contained in this cell. With this configuration, we show that the existence of a positive circuit is a necessary condition for a specific form of multistationarity, which naturally corresponds to spatial differentiation.

Female Drosophila was all put into control group. After cultured for 5 days by one pair in one tube and 10 times of repetition for each group, the egg laying amount and maximum egg laying amount of 10d parental generation (F0) and first filial generation (F1), the emergence rate and emergence amount of F1 and second finial generation (F2), the duration time of eggs-arvae, larvae-pupa, and pupa-adult flies, and the total duration time of emergence were counted. Results: The egg laying amount, emergence rate and emergence amount of EP treated parental Drosophila were significantly lower than those of the control group (P < 0.01).

Ire1 mediated mRNA splicing in a C-terminus deletion mutant of Drosophila Xbp1,25136861,10.1371/journal.pone.0105588,"The Unfolded Protein Response is a homeostatic mechanism that permits eukaryotic cells to cope with Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) stress caused by excessive accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER lumen.

In mammals, two specific regions (the hydrophobic region 2--HR2--and the C-terminal translational pausing site) present in the Xbp1unspliced protein mediate the recruitment of the Xbp1 mRNA-ribosome-nascent chain complex to the ER membrane, so that Xbp1 mRNA can be spliced by Ire1.

Oxygen functions both as a substrate for metabolism to produce energy and as a signaling molecule that activates specific cellular signaling networks. Hypoxia affects metabolism in a passive, generalized manner. Hypoxia also induces the activation of targeted signaling pathways, which may mediate the reduction in body size, or alternatively, compensate for the metabolic perturbations and attenuate the reduction in size.

Interneurons relaying the OFF channel from L1's partner, L2, to T5 are so far not known, however. Results: Here we report that multiple types of transmedulla (Tm) neurons provide unexpectedly complex inputs to T5 at their terminals in the third neuropil, or lobula. From the L2 pathway, single-column input comes from Tm1 and Tm2 and multiple-column input from Tm4 cells. Additional input to T5 comes from Tm9, the medulla target of a third lamina interneuron, L3, providing a candidate substrate for L3's combinatorial action with L2 [3]. Most numerous, Tm2 and Tm9's input synapses are spatially segregated on T5's dendritic arbor, providing candidate anatomical substrates for the two arms of a T5 EMD circuit; Tm1 and Tm2 provide a second. Transcript profiling indicates that T5 expresses both nicotinic and muscarinic cholinoceptors, qualifying T5 to receive cholinergic inputs from Tm9 and Tm2, which both express choline acetyltransferase (ChAT). Conclusions: We hypothesize that T5 computes small-field motion signals by integrating multiple cholinergic Tm inputs using nicotinic and muscarinic cholinoceptors.",2014,"Tzu-Yang Lin, Chi-Hon Lee, Ian A Meinertzhagen, Thangavel Karuppudurai, Kazunori Shinomiya, Zhiyuan Lu"
Time of day influences memory formation and dCREB2 proteins in Drosophila,24744705,10.3389/fnsys.2014.00043,"Many biological phenomena oscillate under the control of the circadian system, exhibiting peaks and troughs of activity across the day/night cycle. In most animal models, memory formation also exhibits this property, but the underlying neuronal and molecular mechanisms remain unclear. The dCREB2 transcription factor shows circadian regulated oscillations in its activity, and has been shown to be important for both circadian biology and memory formation. We show that the time-of-day (TOD) of behavioral training affects Drosophila memory formation. dCREB2 exhibits complex changes in protein levels across the daytime and nighttime, and these changes in protein abundance are likely to contribute to oscillations in dCREB2 activity and TOD effects on memory formation.",2014,"Ellen Siefkes, Anne K Tanenhaus, Jiabin Zhang, Jerry C P Yin, Whitney J Fropf, Robin Fropf"
Regulation of TGF-β Superfamily Signaling by SMAD Mono-Ubiquitination,25317929,10.3390/cells3040981,"TGF-β(transforming growth factor-β) superfamily signaling mediators are important regulators of diverse physiological and pathological events. TGF-β signals are transduced by transmembrane type I and type II serine/threonine kinase receptors and their downstream effectors, the SMAD(drosophila mothers against decapentaplegic protein) proteins. Numerous studies have already demonstrated crucial regulatory roles for modification of TGF-β pathway components by poly-ubiquitination. Recently, several studies also uncovered mono-ubiquitination of SMADs as a mechanism for SMAD activation or inactivation. Mono-ubiquitination and subsequent deubiquitination of SMAD proteins accordingly play important roles in the control of TGF-β superfamily signaling.

Mmp1 and Mmp2 cooperatively induce Drosophila fat body cell dissociation with distinct roles,25520167,10.1038/srep07535,"During Drosophila metamorphosis, the single-cell layer of fat body tissues gradually dissociates into individual cells. Via a fat body-specific RNAi screen in this study, we found that two matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), Mmp1 and Mmp2, are both required for fat body cell dissociation. As revealed through a series of cellular, biochemical, molecular, and genetic experiments, Mmp1 preferentially cleaves DE-cadherin-mediated cell-cell junctions, while Mmp2 preferentially degrades basement membrane (BM) components and thus destroy cell-BM junctions, resulting in the complete dissociation of the entire fat body tissues into individual cells. Moreover, several genetic interaction experiments demonstrated that the roles of Mmp1 and Mmp2 in this developmental process are cooperative. In conclusion, Mmp1 and Mmp2 induce fat body cell dissociation during Drosophila metamorphosis in a cooperative yet distinct manner, a finding that sheds light on the general mechanisms by which MMPs regulate tissue remodeling in animals.",2014,"Qiangqiang Jia, Sheng Li, Yang Liu, Hanhan Liu"
Building a brain under nutritional restriction: insights on sparing and plasticity from Drosophila studies,24723892,10.3389/fphys.2014.00117,"While the growth of the developing brain is known to be well-protected compared to other organs in the face of nutrient restriction (NR), careful analysis has revealed a range of structural alterations and long-term neurological defects. Yet, despite intensive studies, little is known about the basic principles that govern brain development under nutrient deprivation. For over 20 years, Drosophila has proved to be a useful model for investigating how a functional nervous system develops from a restricted number of neural stem cells (NSCs). Recently, a few studies have started to uncover molecular mechanisms as well as region-specific adaptive strategies that preserve brain functionality and neuronal repertoire under NR, while modulating neuron numbers. Here, we review the developmental constraints that condition the response of the developing brain to NR. We then analyze the recent Drosophila work to highlight key principles that drive sparing and plasticity in different regions of the central nervous system (CNS). As simple animal models start to build a more integrated picture, understanding how the developing brain copes with NR could help in defining strategies to limit damage and improve brain recovery after birth.",2014,"Elodie Lanet, Cédric Maurange"
Time flies: Time of day and social environment affect cuticular hydrocarbon sexual displays in Drosophila serrata,25143030,10.1098/rspb.2014.0821,"Recent work on Drosophila cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) challenges a historical assumption that CHCs in flies are largely invariant. Here, we examine the effect of time of day and social environment on a suite of sexually selected CHCs in Drosophila serrata. We demonstrate that males become more attractive to females during the time of day that flies are most active and when most matings occur, but females become less attractive to males during the same time of day. These opposing temporal changes may reflect differences in selection among the sexes. To evaluate the effect of social environment on male CHC attractiveness, we manipulated male opportunity for mating: male flies were housed either alone, with five females, with five males or with five males and five females. We found that males had the most attractive CHCs when with females, and less attractive CHCs when with competitor males. Social environment mediated how male CHC attractiveness cycled: males housed with females and/or other males showed temporal changes in CHC attractiveness, whereas males housed alone did not. In total, our results demonstrate temporal patterning of male CHCs that is dependent on social environment, and suggest that such changes may be beneficial to males.",2014,"Howard D Rundle, Susan N Gershman, Ethan Toumishey"
Evaluation of traditional medicines for neurodegenerative diseases using Drosophila models,24790636,10.1155/2014/967462,"Drosophila is one of the oldest and most powerful genetic models and has led to novel insights into a variety of biological processes.

Using these models, many disease-associated genetic factors have been identified, leading to the identification of compelling drug candidates. Recently, the safety and efficacy of traditional medicines for human diseases have been evaluated in various animal disease models.

"A universal small molecule, inorganic phosphate, restricts the substrate specificity of Dicer-2 in small RNA biogenesis",24787225,10.4161/cc.29066,"The enzyme Dicer is central to the production of small silencing RNAs such as microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Like other insects, Drosophila melanogaster uses different Dicers to make siRNAs and miRNAs: Dicer-1 produces miRNAs from pre-miRNAs, whereas Dicer-2 generates siRNAs from long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). How do the 2 Dicers achieve their substrate specificity? Here, we review recent findings that inorganic phosphate restricts the substrate specificity of Dicer-2 to long dsRNA. Inorganic phosphate inhibits Dicer-2 from binding and cleaving pre-miRNAs, without affecting the processing of long dsRNA. Crystal structures of a fragment of human Dicer in complex with an RNA duplex identify a phosphate-binding pocket that recognizes both the 5'-monophosphate of a substrate RNA and inorganic phosphate. We propose that inorganic phosphate occupies the phosphate-binding pocket in the fly Dicer-2, blocking binding of pre-miRNA and restricting pre-miRNA processing to Dicer-1. Thus, a small molecule can alter the substrate specificity of a nucleic acid-processing enzyme.",2014,"Ryuya Fukunaga, Phillip D Zamore"
Regulation of Drosophila circadian rhythms by miRNA let-7 is mediated by a regulatory cycle,25417916,10.1038/ncomms6549,"MicroRNA-mediated post-transcriptional regulations are increasingly recognized as important components of the circadian rhythm. Here we identify microRNA let-7, part of the Drosophila let-7-Complex, as a regulator of circadian rhythms mediated by a circadian regulatory cycle. Overexpression of let-7 in clock neurons lengthens circadian period and its deletion attenuates the morning activity peak as well as molecular oscillation. Let-7 regulates the circadian rhythm via repression of CLOCKWORK ORANGE (CWO). Conversely, upregulated cwo in cwo-expressing cells can rescue the phenotype of let-7-Complex overexpression. Moreover, circadian prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) and CLOCK-regulated 20-OH ecdysteroid signalling contribute to the circadian expression of let-7 through the 20-OH ecdysteroid receptor.

The ESCRT machinery regulates the secretion and long-range activity of Hedgehog,25471885,10.1038/nature13847,"The conserved family of Hedgehog (Hh) proteins acts as short- and long-range secreted morphogens, controlling tissue patterning and differentiation during embryonic development. Mature Hh carries hydrophobic palmitic acid and cholesterol modifications essential for its extracellular spreading. Various extracellular transportation mechanisms for Hh have been suggested, but the pathways actually used for Hh secretion and transport in vivo remain unclear. Here we show that Hh secretion in Drosophila wing imaginal discs is dependent on the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT). In vivo the reduction of ESCRT activity in cells producing Hh leads to a retention of Hh at the external cell surface. Furthermore, we show that ESCRT activity in Hh-producing cells is required for long-range signalling. We also provide evidence that pools of Hh and ESCRT proteins are secreted together into the extracellular space in vivo and can subsequently be detected together at the surface of receiving cells. These findings uncover a new function for ESCRT proteins in controlling morphogen activity and reveal a new mechanism for the transport of secreted Hh across the tissue by extracellular vesicles, which is necessary for long-range target induction.",2014,"Sandrine Pizette, Maximilian Fürthauer, Sophie Polès, Pascal P Thérond, Tamás Matusek, Franz Wendler, Gisela D'Angelo"
Dual mode of embryonic development is highlighted by expression and function of Nasonia pair-rule genes,24599282,10.7554/eLife.01440,"Embryonic anterior-posterior patterning is well understood in Drosophila, which uses 'long germ' embryogenesis, in which all segments are patterned before cellularization. In contrast, most insects use 'short germ' embryogenesis, wherein only head and thorax are patterned in a syncytial environment while the remainder of the embryo is generated after cellularization. We use the wasp Nasonia (Nv) to address how the transition from short to long germ embryogenesis occurred. Maternal and gap gene expression in Nasonia suggest long germ embryogenesis. However, the Nasonia pair-rule genes even-skipped, odd-skipped, runt and hairy are all expressed as early blastoderm pair-rule stripes and late-forming posterior stripes. Knockdown of Nv eve, odd or h causes loss of alternate segments at the anterior and complete loss of abdominal segments. We propose that Nasonia uses a mixed mode of segmentation wherein pair-rule genes pattern the embryo in a manner resembling Drosophila at the anterior and ancestral Tribolium at the posterior.

Acute and chronic effects of atmospheric oxygen on the feeding behavior of Drosophila melanogaster larvae,25008193,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2014.06.017,"All insects studied to date show reduced growth rates in hypoxia. Drosophila melanogaster reared in moderate hypoxia (10 kPa PO2) grow more slowly and form smaller adults, but the mechanisms responsible are unclear, as metabolic rates are not oxygen-limited. It has been shown that individual fruit flies do not grow larger in hyperoxia (40 kPa PO2), but populations of flies evolve larger size. Here we studied the effect of acute and chronic variation in atmospheric PO2 (10, 21, 40 kPa) on feeding behavior of third instar larvae of D.melanogaster to assess whether oxygen effects on growth rate can be explained by effects on feeding behavior. Hypoxic-reared larvae grew and developed more slowly, and hyperoxic-rearing did not affect growth rate, maximal larval mass or developmental time. The effect of acute exposure to varying PO2 on larval bite rates matched the pattern observed for growth rates, with a 22% reduction in 10 kPa PO2 and no effect of 40 kPa PO2. Chronic rearing in hypoxia had few effects on the responses of feeding rates to oxygen, but chronic rearing in hyperoxia caused feeding rates to be strongly oxygen-dependent. Hypoxia produced similar reductions in bite rate and in the volume of tunnels excavated by larvae, supporting bite rate as an index of feeding behavior. Overall, our data show that reductions in feeding rate can explain reduced growth rates in moderate hypoxia for Drosophila, contributing to reduced body size, and that larvae cannot successfully compensate for this level of hypoxia with developmental plasticity.",2014,"Todd Albert, Tahnee Dodge, Nicholas Pierce, John M VandenBrooks, Manoush Farzin, Jon F Harrison"
Notch signaling acts before cell division to promote asymmetric cleavage and cell fate of neural precursor cells,25336614,10.1126/scisignal.2005317,"Asymmetric cell divisions in the central nervous system generate neurons of diverse fates. In Drosophila melanogaster, the protein Numb localizes asymmetrically to dividing neural precursor cells such that only one daughter cell inherits Numb. Numb inhibits Notch signaling in this daughter cell, resulting in a different cell fate from the Notch-induced fate in the other-Numb-negative-daughter cell. Precursor cells undergo asymmetric cytokinesis generating daughter cells of different sizes. I found that inactivation of Notch in fly embryonic neural precursor cells disrupted the asymmetric positioning of the cleavage furrow and produced daughter cells of the same size and fate. Moreover, inactivation of Notch at different times altered the degree of asymmetric Numb localization, such that earlier inactivation of Notch caused symmetric distribution of Numb and later inactivation produced incomplete asymmetric localization of Numb. The extent of asymmetrically localized Numb positively correlated with the degree of asymmetric cytokinesis and the size disparity in daughter cells. Loss of Numb or expression of constitutively active Notch led to premature specification of the precursor cells into the fate of one of the daughter cells. Thus, in addition to its role in the specification of daughter cell fate after division, Notch controls Numb localization in the precursor cells to determine the size and fate of daughter cells. Numb also inhibits Notch signaling in precursor cells to prevent Notch-induced differentiation of the precursor cell, forming an autoregulatory loop.",2014,Krishna Moorthi Bhat

Contrasting influences of Drosophila white/mini-white on ethanol sensitivity in two different behavioral assays,24890118,10.1111/acer.12421,"Background: The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has been used extensively to investigate genetic mechanisms of ethanol (EtOH)-related behaviors. Many past studies in flies, including studies from our laboratory, have manipulated gene expression using transposons carrying the genetic-phenotypic marker mini-white(mini-w), a derivative of the endogenous gene white(w). Whether the mini-w transgenic marker or the endogenous w gene influences behavioral responses to acute EtOH exposure in flies has not been systematically investigated. Methods: We manipulated mini-w and w expression via (i) transposons marked with mini-w, (ii) RNAi against mini-w and w, and (iii) a null allele of w. We assessed EtOH sensitivity and tolerance using a previously described eRING assay (based on climbing in the presence of EtOH) and an assay based on EtOH-induced sedation. Results: In eRING assays, EtOH-induced impairment of climbing correlated inversely with expression of the mini-w marker from a series of transposon insertions. Additionally, flies harboring a null allele of w or flies with RNAi-mediated knockdown of mini-w were significantly more sensitive to EtOH in eRING assays than controls expressing endogenous w or the mini-w marker. In contrast, EtOH sensitivity and rapid tolerance measured in the EtOH sedation assay were not affected by decreased expression of mini-w or endogenous w in flies. Conclusions: EtOH sensitivity measured in the eRING assay is noticeably influenced by w and mini-w, making eRING problematic for studies on EtOH-related behavior in Drosophila using transgenes marked with mini-w. In contrast, the EtOH sensitivity assay described here is a suitable behavioral paradigm for studies on EtOH sensitivity and rapid tolerance in Drosophila including those that use widely available transgenes marked with mini-w.",2014,"Jacqueline M DeLoyht, Kristyn Sennett, Scarlett Coffman, Matthew Hewitt, Lara Lewellyn, Robin F Chan, Mike Grotewiel, John M Warrick, Jill C Bettinger"

However, in the absence of Dlp or endocytic activity, Wg can still move across cells along the apical (Ap) surface. We identified a novel secreted heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) that binds to Wg and promotes its extracellular distribution by increasing Wg mobility, which was thus named Carrier of Wg (Cow). Cow promotes the Ap transport of Wg, independent of Dlp and endocytosis, and this function addresses a previous gap in the understanding of Wg movement.

Role of amino terminus in voltage gating and junctional rectification of Shaking B innexins,24381032,10.1152/jn.00385.2013,"Rectifying electrical synapses are rare gap junctions that favor transmission of signals in one direction. Such synapses have been identified in neural systems, including those mediating rapid escape responses of arthropods. In the Drosophila giant fiber system, adjacent cells express and contribute different transcript variants of the innexin Shaking B, resulting in heterotypic gap junctions with rectifying properties. When expressed exogenously, variants Shaking B Lethal (ShakBL) and Shaking B neural + 16 (ShakBN16) form heterotypic junctions that gate asymmetrically in response to transjunctional voltage. To determine whether the amino terminus confers properties of gating and rectification, amino-terminal domains were exchanged between ShakBL and ShakBN16, creating chimeric proteins SBL NTN16 and SBN16 NTL. The properties were analyzed in paired Xenopus oocytes. Our results suggest that the amino terminus plays an important role in establishing rectifying properties inherent to heterotypic junctions composed of ShakBL and ShakBN16. ShakBL/SBL NTN16 junctions behaved similarly to ShakBL/ShakBN16 junctions, gating in response to transjunctional voltage of one polarity and inducing a highly asymmetric conductance-voltage relationship. However, the amino terminus did not act independently to confer sensitivity to transjunctional voltage. The complementary pairing ShakBN16/SBN16 NTL displayed little sensitivity to voltage of either polarity, and in homotypic pairings SBL NTN16 was strongly gated by transjunctional voltage.

Physiological/pathophysiological functions of this highly versatile cation channel protein are as yet incompletely understood. Its ability to associate in a dynamic manner with a variety of partner proteins enables TRPC3 to serve coordination of multiple downstream signaling pathways and control of divergent cellular functions.

Dual phosphorylation of cdk1 coordinates cell proliferation with key developmental processes in Drosophila,24214341,10.1534/genetics.113.156281,"Eukaryotic organisms use conserved checkpoint mechanisms that regulate Cdk1 by inhibitory phosphorylation to prevent mitosis from interfering with DNA replication or repair. In metazoans, this checkpoint mechanism is also used for coordinating mitosis with dynamic developmental processes. Inhibitory phosphorylation of Cdk1 is catalyzed by Wee1 kinases that phosphorylate tyrosine 15 (Y15) and dual-specificity Myt1 kinases found only in metazoans that phosphorylate Y15 and the adjacent threonine (T14) residue. Despite partially redundant roles in Cdk1 inhibitory phosphorylation, Wee1 and Myt1 serve specialized developmental functions that are not well understood. Here, we expressed wild-type and phospho-acceptor mutant Cdk1 proteins to investigate how biochemical differences in Cdk1 inhibitory phosphorylation influence Drosophila imaginal development. Phosphorylation of Cdk1 on Y15 appeared to be crucial for developmental and DNA damage-induced G2-phase checkpoint arrest, consistent with other evidence that Myt1 is the major Y15-directed Cdk1 inhibitory kinase at this stage of development. Expression of non-inhibitable Cdk1 also caused chromosome defects in larval neuroblasts that were not observed with Cdk1(Y15F) mutant proteins that were phosphorylated on T14, implicating Myt1 in a novel mechanism promoting genome stability. Collectively, these results suggest that dual inhibitory phosphorylation of Cdk1 by Myt1 serves at least two functions during development. Phosphorylation of Y15 is essential for the premitotic checkpoint mechanism, whereas T14 phosphorylation facilitates accumulation of dually inhibited Cdk1-Cyclin B complexes that can be rapidly activated once checkpoint-arrested G2-phase cells are ready for mitosis.",2014,"Joseph O Ayeni, Oindrila Mukherjee, Frank Sprenger, Martin Srayko, Shelagh D Campbell, Ramya Varadarajan, David T Stuart"
Osmotic regulation in adult Drosophila melanogaster during dehydration and rehydration,15159436,10.1242/jeb.01024,"We have examined the osmoregulatory capacities of laboratory populations of the insect Drosophila melanogaster by measuring hemolymph osmotic concentration during desiccation and upon recovery from a bout of desiccation.

Prior to desiccation, the hemolymph osmotic concentration was 353+/-11 mOsm. We found that Drosophila display strict osmotic regulation under prolonged conditions of dehydration. Osmotic regulation continued during recovery from desiccation, regardless of the fluid provided. This result is evidence that this insect does not require an external source of osmolytes or energy to regulate its hemolymph osmotic concentration or to restore hemolymph volume, which is reduced during desiccation. We also examined populations that have been selected for over 250 generations for enhanced desiccation resistance to identify physiological characters that have evolved in response to the selection regime.

The sibling species group comprised of two cosmopolitan (Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans) and two island (Drosophila mauritiana and Drosophila sechellia) species has become a model system for such studies. In the present study we reanalyzed the pattern of protein variation in these species, and the results were compared against the patterns of nucleotide variation obtained from the literature, mostly available for melanogaster and simulans. We have mainly focused on the contrasting patterns of variation between the cosmopolitan pair. The results can be summarized as follows: (1) As expected the island species D. mauritiana and D. sechellia showed much less variation than the cosmopolitan species D. melanogaster and D. simulans. (2) The chromosome 2 showed significantly less variation than chromosome 3 and X in all four species which may indicate effects of past selective sweeps. (3) In contrast to its overall low variation, D. mauritiana showed highest variation for X-linked loci which may indicate introgression from its sibling, D. simulans. (4) An average population of D. simulans was as heterozygous as that of D. melanogaster (14.4% v.s. 13.9%) but the difference was large and significant when considering only polymorphic loci (37.2% v.s. 26.1%). (5) The species-wise pooled populations of these two species showed similar results (all loci = 18.3% v.s. 20.0%, polymorphic loci = 47.2% v.s. 37.6%). (6) An average population of D. simulans had more low-frequency alleles than D. melanogaster, and the D. simulans alleles were found widely distributed in all populations whereas the D. melanogaster alleles were limited to local populations. As a results of this, pooled populations of D. melanogaster showed more polymorphic loci than those of D. simulans (48.0% v.s. 32.0%) but the difference was reduced when the comparison was made on the basis of an average population (29.1% v.s. 21.4%). (7) While the allele frequency distributions within populations were nonsignificant in both D. melanogaster and D. simulans, melanogaster had fewer than simulans, but more than expected from the neutral theory, low frequency alleles. (8) Diallelic loci with the second allele with a frequency less than 20% had similar frequencies in all four species but those with the second allele with a frequency higher than 20% were limited to only melanogaster the latter group of loci have clinal (latitudinal) patterns of variation indicative of balancing selection. (9) The comparison of D. simulans/D. melanogaster protein variation gave a ratio of 1.04 for all loci and 1.42 for polymorphic loci, against a ratio of approximately 2-fold difference for silent nucleotide sites. This suggests that the species ratios of protein and silent nucleotide polymorphism are too close to call for selective difference between silent and allozyme variation in D. simulans. In conclusion, the contrasting levels of allozyme polymorphism, distribution of rare alleles, number of diallelic loci and the patterns of geographic differentiation between the two species suggest the role of natural selection in D. melanogaster, and of possibly ancient population structure and recent worldwide migration in D. simulans. Population size differences alone are insufficient as an explanation for the patterns of variation between these two species.",2004,"Madhu Choudhary, Rama S Singh, Richard A Morton, Marie-Louise Cariou"
Heads or tails: host-parasite interactions in the Drosophila-Wolbachia system,15345422,10.1128/AEM.70.9.5366-5372.2004,"Wolbachia strains are endosymbiotic bacteria typically found in the reproductive tracts of arthropods. These bacteria manipulate host reproduction to ensure maternal transmission. They are usually transmitted vertically, so it has been predicted that they have evolved a mechanism to target the host's germ cells during development. Through cytological analysis we found that Wolbachia strains display various affinities for the germ line of Drosophila. Different Wolbachia strains show posterior, anterior, or cortical localization in Drosophila embryos, and this localization is congruent with the classification of the organisms based on the wsp (Wolbachia surface protein) gene sequence. This embryonic distribution pattern is established during early oogenesis and does not change until late stages of embryogenesis. The posterior and anterior localization of Wolbachia resembles that of oskar and bicoid mRNAs, respectively, which define the anterior-posterior axis in the Drosophila oocyte. By comparing the properties of a single Wolbachia strain in different host backgrounds and the properties of different Wolbachia strains in the same host background, we concluded that bacterial factors determine distribution, while bacterial density seems to be limited by the host. Possible implications concerning cytoplasmic incompatibility and evolution of strains are discussed.",2004,"Timothy L Karr, Michael E Clark, Zoe Veneti, Kostas Bourtzis, Charalambos Savakis"
Host resistance does not explain variation in incidence of male-killing bacteria in Drosophila bifasciata,15571631,10.1186/1471-2148-4-52,"Background: Selfish genetic elements that distort the sex ratio are found widely. Notwithstanding the number of records of sex ratio distorters, their incidence is poorly understood. Two factors can prevent a sex ratio distorter from invading: inability of the sex ratio distorter to function (failure of mechanism or transmission), and lack of drive if they do function (inappropriate ecology for invasion). There has been no test to date on factors causing variation in the incidence of sex ratio distorting cytoplasmic bacteria. We therefore examined whether absence of the male-killing Wolbachia infection in D. bifasciata in Hokkaido island of Japan, in contrast to the presence of infection on the proximal island of Honshu, was associated with failure of the infection to function properly on the Hokkaido genetic background. Results: The male-killer both transmitted and functioned well following introgression to each of 24 independent isofemale inbred lines carrying Hokkaido genetic backgrounds. This was maintained even under stringent conditions of temperature. We therefore reject the hypothesis that absence of infection is due to its inability to kill males and transmit on the Hokkaido genetic background. Further trap data indicates that D. bifasciata may occur at different densities in Hokkaido and Honshu populations, giving some credence to the idea that ecological differentiation could be important. Conclusions: The absence of the infection from the Hokkaido population is not caused by failure of the male-killer to function on the Hokkaido genetic background.",2004,"Zoe Veneti, Masanori J Toda, Gregory D D Hurst"
[The differences and regularities of life-span dynamics for human and animal populations],15754949,,"The dynamics of mortality of several generations of man, Wistar rats and line Canton-S fruit flies Drosophila melanogaster was investigated. The result was, that the correlation between sample mean and sample variance was negative for man, positive for flies and was absent for rats. To fit the survival curve we chose two-parametric Gompertz function. Starting from Strehler-Mildwan correlation (linear correlation between Gompertz function parameters), we obtained theoretical dependence between life-span mean and variance. This dependence had complex shape and points, corresponding to different species were situated at different segments of this curve that is corresponding to the various sign of correlation between these characteristics. Increasing of the mean man life-span attribute usually to advances in medicine and social environment. Associated with this the decreasing of the life-span variance, as it follows from this paper, depends on parameter point location on parametric plane, i.e. from biological feature of species.",2004,A V Krementsova
Mapping of a Leishmania major gene/locus that confers pentamidine resistance by deletion and insertion of transposable element,15141283,10.1590/s0036-46652004000200010,"Pentamidine (PEN) is an alternative compound to treat antimony-resistant leishmaniasis patients, which cellular target remains unclear. One approach to the identification of prospective targets is to identify genes able to mediate PEN resistance following overexpression. Starting from a genomic library of transfected parasites bearing a multicopy episomal cosmid vector containing wild-type Leishmania major DNA, we isolated one locus capable to render PEN resistance to wild type cells after DNA transfection. In order to map this Leishmania locus, cosmid insert was deleted by two successive sets of partial digestion with restriction enzymes, followed by transfection into wild type cells, overexpression, induction and functional tests in the presence of PEN. To determine the Leishmania gene related to PEN resistance, nucleotide sequencing experiments were done through insertion of the transposon Mariner element of Drosophila melanogaster (mosK) into the deleted insert to work as primer island. Using general molecular techniques, we described here this method that permits a quickly identification of a functional gene facilitating nucleotide sequence experiments from large DNA fragments. Followed experiments revealed the presence of a P-Glycoprotein gene in this locus which role in Leishmania metabolism has now been analyzed.",2004,"Paulo C Cotrim, Luiz R O Tosi, Adriano C Coelho"
Epigenetic regulation of telomere length in mammalian cells by the Suv39h1 and Suv39h2 histone methyltransferases,14702045,10.1038/ng1278,"Telomeres are capping structures at the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes composed of TTAGGG repeats bound to an array of specialized proteins. Telomeres are heterochromatic regions. Yeast and flies with defects in activities that modify the state of chromatin also have abnormal telomere function, but the putative role of chromatin-modifying activities in regulating telomeres in mammals is unknown. Here we report on telomere length and function in mice null with respect to both the histone methyltransferases (HMTases) Suv39h1 and Suv39h2 (called SUV39DN mice). Suv39h1 and Suv39h2 govern methylation of histone H3 Lys9 (H3-Lys9) in heterochromatic regions. We show that primary cells derived from SUV39DN mice have abnormally long telomeres relative to wild-type controls. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis, we found that telomeres were enriched in di- and trimethylated H3-Lys9 but that telomeres of SUV39DN cells had less dimethylated and trimethylated H3-Lys9 but more monomethylated H3-Lys9. Concomitant with the decrease in H3-Lys9 methylation, telomeres in SUV39DN cells had reduced binding of the chromobox proteins Cbx1, Cbx3 and Cbx5, homologs of Drosophila melanogaster heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1). These findings indicate substantial changes in the state of telomeric heterochromatin in SUV39DN cells, which are associated with abnormal telomere elongation.

Diverse substrate recognition mechanisms for rhomboids; thrombomodulin is cleaved by Mammalian rhomboids,14761657,10.1016/j.cub.2004.01.025,"The rhomboids are a recently discovered family of intramembrane proteases that are conserved across evolution. Drosophila was the first organism in which they were characterized, where at least Rhomboids 1-3 activate EGF receptor signaling by releasing the active forms of EGF-like growth factors. Subsequent work has begun to shed light on the role of these proteases in bacteria and yeast, but nothing is known about the function of rhomboids in vertebrates beyond evidence that the subclass of mitochondrial rhomboids is conserved. Here, we report that the anticoagulant cell-surface protein thrombomodulin is the first mammalian protein to be a rhomboid substrate in a cell culture assay. The thrombomodulin transmembrane domain (TMD) is cleaved only by vertebrate RHBDL2-like rhomboids. Thrombomodulin TMD cleavage is directed not by sequences within the TMD, as is the case with Spitz but by its cytoplasmic domain, which, at least in some contexts, is necessary and sufficient to determine cleavage by RHBDL2. These data suggest that thrombomodulin could be a physiological substrate for rhomboid. Moreover, the discovery of a second mode of substrate recognition by rhomboids implies mechanistic diversity in this family of intramembrane proteases.",2004,"Sinisa Urban, Olli Lohi, Matthew Freeman"

The early gene Broad is involved in the ecdysteroid hierarchy governing vitellogenesis of the mosquito Aedes aegypti,15591032,10.1677/jme.1.01531,"The broad (br) gene, encoding a family of C2H2 type zinc-finger DNA-binding proteins, has been shown to act as a crucial member of the 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) regulatory hierarchy in the fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster and the moth, Manduca sexta. In this study, we have shown that the br gene is involved in the 20E-regulatory hierarchy controlling vitellogenesis in the mosquito, Aedes aegypti. Unlike E74 and E75 early genes, expression of br was activated in previtellogenic females, during a juvenile hormone (JH)-dependent period. The levels of Z1, Z2 and Z4 isoform mRNA were elevated in the fat body of 2-day-old females after in vitro exposure to JH III. However, JH III repressed 20E activation of br in 3-to 5-day-old females, indicating a switch in hormonal commitment. Expression of Z1, Z2 and Z4 was stimulated after blood feeding in both vitellogenic tissues, the fat body and the ovary, corresponding to peaks of ecdysteroid titers. In the fat body, the mRNA profiles of these three isoforms correlated well with those of yolk protein precursor (YPP) genes. These BR isoforms were activated by 20E in fat bodies cultured in vitro and behaved as early genes, with a self-repressive autoregulatory loop that can be blocked by the protein inhibitor, cyclohexamide. Multiple binding sites for all four BR isoforms were present in the 5'-regulatory region of the major YPP gene, vitellogenin (Vg). Effects of BR isoforms on the expression of Vg have been demonstrated by cell transfection analysis. In particular, BR isoforms by themselves had no effects on the Vg promoter. However, Z1 and Z4 each repressed Aedes aegypti ecdysone receptor (EcR)/Ultraspiracle (USP)-mediated 20E activation of the Vg promoter, while Z2 enhanced activation of the Vg promoter by AaEcR/AaUSP in the presence of 20E. Z3 had no obvious effect in the same experiment. These results suggested that BR isoforms are essential for proper activation and termination of the Vg gene in response to 20E. Overall, our study implicated br in the regulation of mosquito vitellogenesis.",2004,"J Zhu, G Sun, L Chen, A S Raikhel"
"Cg-Rel, the first Rel/NF-kappaB homolog characterized in a mollusk, the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas",15013754,10.1016/S0014-5793(04)00124-3,"We report here the identification and functional characterization of Cg-Rel, a gene encoding the Crassostrea gigas homolog of Rel/NF-kappaB transcription factors found in insects and mammals. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis showed that Cg-Rel shares the structural organization of Rel/NF-kappaB transcription factors of class II. It includes a Rel homology domain as well as a C-terminal transactivation domain (TD). Overexpression of Cg-Rel in the Drosophila S2 cell line activated the expression of a NF-kappaB-dependent reporter gene, whereas transfection with a Cg-Rel construct containing a C-terminal deletion of the TD or using a reporter gene with mutated kappaB binding sites failed to activate expression. These results suggest that Cg-Rel is a functional member of the Rel family of transcription factors, making this the sixth structurally homologous component of the Rel/NF-kappaB pathway characterized in C. gigas. Based on homology to other invertebrates' Rel/NF-kappaB cascade, the function of the oyster pathway may serve to regulate genes involved in innate defense and/or development.

unc-119 homolog required for normal development of the zebrafish nervous system,15593328,10.1002/gene.20089,"The UNC-119 proteins, found in all metazoans examined, are highly conserved at both the sequence and functional levels. In the invertebrates Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster, unc-119 genes are expressed pan-neurally. Loss of function of the unc-119 gene in C. elegans results in a disorganized neural architecture and paralysis. The function of UNC-119 proteins has been conserved throughout evolution, as transgenic expression of the human UNC119 gene in C. elegans unc-119 mutants restores a wild-type phenotype. However, the nature of the conserved molecular function of UNC-119 proteins is poorly understood. Although unc-119 genes are expressed throughout the nervous system of the worm and fly, the analysis of these genes in vertebrates has focused on their function in the photoreceptor cells of the retina. Here we report the characterization of an unc-119 homolog in the zebrafish. The Unc119 protein is expressed in various neural tissues in the developing zebrafish embryo and larva. Morpholino oligonucleotide (MO)-mediated knockdown of Unc119 protein results in a ""curly tail down"" phenotype. Examination of neural patterning demonstrates that these ""curly tail down"" zebrafish experience a constellation of neuronal defects similar to those seen in C. elegans unc-119 mutants: missing or misplaced cell bodies, process defasciculation, axon pathfinding errors, and aberrant axonal branching.

"Control of bract formation in Drosophila: poxn, kek1, and the EGF-R pathway",15286997,10.1002/gene.20052,"In Drosophila, the sensory organs are formed by cells that derive from a precursor cell through a fixed lineage.

On the adult tibia, bracts are associated with all mechanosensory bristles, but not with chemosensory bristles. The differences between chemosensory and mechanosensory lineages are controlled by the selector gene pox-neuro (poxn). Here we show that poxn is also involved in suppressing bract formation near the chemosensory bristles.

The evolution of arthropod segmentation mechanisms,15382142,10.1002/bies.20097,"The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, patterns its segments rapidly and simultaneously, via a mechanism that relies on the ability of transcription factors to diffuse between blastoderm nuclei. Ancestral arthropods patterned posterior segments sequentially in a cellular environment, where free diffusion was likely to have been inhibited by the presence of cell membranes. Understanding how the Drosophila paradigm evolved is a problem that has interested evolutionary developmental biologists for some time. In this article, I review what is known about arthropod segmentation mechanisms, and present a model for the evolution of the Drosophila paradigm. The model predicts that the primary pair-rule genes of Drosophila ancestrally functioned within and/or downstream of a Notch-dependent segmentation clock, their striped expression gradually coming under the control of gap genes as the number of segments patterned simultaneously in the anterior increased and the number patterned sequentially via a segmentation clock mechanism in the posterior correspondingly decreased.",2004,Andrew Peel

We observe that monomolecular odors generally elicit responses in large ensembles of antennal lobe neurons. Comparison of odor-evoked activity from afferents and postsynaptic neurons in the same glomerulus revealed that second-order neurons display broader tuning and more complex responses than their primary afferents.

Germline stem cells in the Drosophila ovary descend from pole cells in the anterior region of the embryonic gonad,15459101,10.1242/dev.01391,"A fundamental yet unexplored question in stem cell biology is how the fate of tissue stem cells is initially determined during development. In Drosophila, germline stem cells (GSCs) descend from a subset of primordial germ cells (PGCs) at the onset of oogenesis. GSC determination may occur at the onset of oogenesis when a subset of PGCs is induced to become GSCs by contacting niche cells. Alternatively, the GSC fate could be predetermined for a subset of PGCs before oogenesis, due to either their interaction with specific somatic cells in the embryonic/larval gonads, or their inherently heterogeneous potential in becoming GSCs, or both. Here, we show that anterior somatic cells in the embryonic gonad already differ from posterior somatic cells and are likely to be the precursors of niche cells in the adult ovary. Furthermore, only pole cells in the anterior half of the embryonic gonad give rise to the PGCs that frequently acquire contact with nascent niche cells in the late larval ovary. Eventually, only these contacting PGCs become GSCs, whereas non-contacting PGCs directly differentiate into cystoblasts. The strong preference of these 'anterior PGCs' towards contacting niche cells does not require DE-cadherin-mediated adhesion and is not correlated with either orientation or rate of their divisions. These data suggest that the GSC fate is predetermined before oogenesis. The predetermination probably involves soma/pole-cell interaction in the anterior half of the embryonic gonad, followed by an active homing mechanism during PGC proliferation to maintain the contact between the 'anterior PGCs' and anterior somatic cells.",2004,"Haifan Lin, Miho Asaoka"

Our data demonstrate a novel role for Hrb27C in promoting grk localization. We also observe a direct physical interaction between Hrb27C and Ovarian tumor (Otu), a cytoplasmic protein implicated in RNA localization. We find that some otu alleles produce dorsalized eggs and it appears that Otu cooperates with Hrb27C and Sqd in the oocyte to mediate proper grk localization.

Since the wild-type (WT) Kir2.1 channel appeared to be saturated by the prevailing PIP(2) concentration, we made a single amino acid substitution (R228Q), which reduced the effective affinity for PIP(2) and yielded channels generating currents proportional to the PIP(2) levels relevant for phototransduction. To isolate Kir2.1 currents, recordings were made from mutants lacking both classes of light-sensitive transient receptor potential channels (TRP and TRPL). Light resulted in the effective depletion of PIP(2) by phospholipase C (PLC) in approximately three or four microvilli per absorbed photon at rates exceeding approximately 150% of total microvillar phosphoinositides per second. PIP(2) was resynthesized with a half-time of approximately 50 s. When PIP(2) resynthesis was prevented by depriving the cell of ATP, the Kir current spontaneously decayed at maximal rates representing a loss of approximately 40% loss of total PIP(2) per minute. This loss was attributed primarily to basal PLC activity, because it was greatly decreased in norpA mutants lacking PLC. We tried to confirm this by using the PLC inhibitor U73122; however, this was found to act as a novel inhibitor of the Kir2.1 channel. PIP(2) levels were reduced approximately 5-fold in the diacylglycerol kinase mutant (rdgA), but basal PLC activity was still pronounced, consistent with the suggestion that raised diacylglycerol levels are responsible for the constitutive TRP channel activity characteristic of this mutant.",2004,"Sean T Sweeney, Fernando Martin, Roger C Hardie, Yuchun Gu, Padinjat Raghu"

A third enzyme, necessary for the critical conversion of ecdysone to 20-hydroxyecdysone, the 20-monooxygenase, is encoded by shade (shd) (CYP314A1). All three enzymes are mitochondrial although shade has motifs suggesting both mitochondrial and microsomal locations. By tagging these enzymes, their subcellular location has been confirmed by confocal microscopy.

Confocal imaging suggests that distal enhancers often loop to the Abd-B promoter region. Surprisingly, enhancers located on one chromosome frequently associate with the Abd-B transcription unit located on the other homolog. These trans-homolog interactions can be interpreted as the direct visualization of a genetic phenomenon known as transvection, whereby certain mutations in Abd-B can be rescued in trans by the other copy of the gene. A 10 kb sequence in the 3' flanking region mediates tight pairing of Abd-B alleles, thereby facilitating trans looping of distal enhancers.

Expression of Zic5 overlapped with those of other Zic genes, most closely with Zic2, but was not identical. Targeted disruption of Zic5 resulted in insufficient neural tube closure at the rostral end, similar to that seen in Zic2 mutant mice. In addition, the Zic5-deficient mice exhibited malformation of neural-crest-derived facial bones, especially the mandible, which had not been observed in other Zic family mutants. During the embryonic stages, there were delays in the development of the first branchial arch and extension of the trigeminal and facial nerves. Neural crest marker staining revealed fewer neural crest cells in the dorsal cephalic region of the mutant embryos without significant changes in their migration. When mouse Zic5 was overexpressed in Xenopus embryos, expression of a neural crest marker was enhanced. These findings suggested that Zic5 is involved in the generation of neural crest tissue in mouse development. ZIC5 is also located close to ZIC2 in humans, and deletions of 13q32, where ZIC2 is located, lead to congenital brain and digit malformations known as the ""13q32 deletion syndrome"". Based on both their similar expression pattern in mouse embryos and the malformations observed in Zic5-deficient mutant mice, human ZIC5 might be involved in the deletion syndrome.",2004,"Shigeyoshi Itohara, Jun Aruga, Takashi Inoue, Katsuhiko Mikoshiba, Takahide Tohmonda, Minoru Hatayama"
Analysis of cell proliferation in Drosophila wing imaginal discs using mosaic clones,14735139,10.1038/sj.hdy.6800408,"Experimental data on spatial and temporal distributions of mosaic clones in Drosophila wing imaginal disc were analyzed. Long-lived proliferation centers (PR1, PR2, and PR3) and areas with decreased proliferation activity were found in the notum region of the disc. Simulation of the growth kinetics of mosaic patches demonstrated that the cell cycle in proliferation centers PR2 and PR3 was shorter than the average cycle in the disc and in the center PR1. A nonrandom clustering of rapidly dividing cells was observed in the PR2, but not in the other cases. The reason why the cell-cycle duration and the clustering of dividing cells may not coincide is discussed in terms of the recruitment of nondividing cells into the cell cycle. The simulation of the time course of the first and second moments of the size distribution of mosaic clones allowed the variance of cell-cycle progression rates to be determined and demonstrated that a model with a continuous cell-cycle rates gave a better fit to the data than the transition probability model of Smith and Martin.",2004,"L Omelyanchuk, T Dubatolova"
"Cytotoxic, genotoxic and mutagenic evaluation of surface waters from a coal exploration region",28092765,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.01.024,"Coal mining generates a considerable amount of waste, which is disposed of in piles or dams near mining sites. As a result, leachates may reach rivers and streams, promoting the wide dispersion of contaminants in solution and as particulate matter. The present study evaluated the cytotoxic, genotoxic, and mutagenic action of surface waters collected around a thermoelectric power plant and the largest mining area in Brazil (Candiota). Four sites in Candiota stream were selected, and samples were collected in winter and summer. Water samples were analyzed using the comet and CBMN assays in V79 and HepG2 cells. Furthermore, genotoxicity of water samples was evaluated in vivo using the SMART in Drosophila melanogaster. In addition, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and inorganic elements were quantified. The results indicate that water samples exhibited no genotoxic and mutagenic activities, whether in vitro or in vivo. On the other hand, surface water samples collected in sites near the power plant in both summer and winter inhibited cell proliferation and induced increased frequencies of V79 cell death, apoptosis, and necrosis. The cytotoxicity observed may be associated with the presence of higher concentration of inorganic elements, especially aluminum, silicon, sulfur, titanium and zinc at sites 1 and 2 in the stream, as well as with the complex mixture present in the coal, in both seasons. Therefore, the results obtained point to the toxicity potential of water samples with the influence of coal mining and combustion processes and the possible adverse effects on the health of exposed organisms.",2017,"Juliana da Silva, Hélio Vieira Bernardes, Mauricio Lehmann, Rafael Rodrigues Dihl, Fernanda Rabaioli da Silva, Anaí Duarte, Débora Lemes Dos Santos, Johnny Ferraz Dias, Cynthia Silva Porta, Bruno Corrêa Bellagamba"
Knockdown of APPL mimics transgenic Aβ induced neurodegenerative phenotypes in Drosophila,28336338,10.1016/j.neulet.2017.03.030,"A variety of Drosophila mutant lines have been established as potential disease-models to study various disease mechanisms including human neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD), Huntington's disease (HD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). The evolutionary conservation of APP (Amyloid Precursor Protein) and APPL (Amyloid Precursor Protein-Like) and the comparable detrimental effects caused by their metabolic products strongly implies the conservation of their normal physiological functions. In view of this milieu, a comparative analysis on the pattern of neurodegenerative phenotypes between Drosophila APPL-RNAi line and transgenic Drosophila line expressing eye tissue specific human Aβ (Amyloid beta) was undertaken. Our results clearly show that Drosophila APPL-RNAi largely mimics transgenic Aβ in various phenotypes which include eye degeneration, reduced longevity and motor neuron deficit functions, etc. The ultra-structural morphological pattern of eye degeneration was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. Further, a comparative study on longevity and motor behaviour between Aβ expressing and APPL knockdown lines revealed similar kind of behavioural deficit and longevity phenotypes. Therefore, it is suggested that APPL-knockdown approach can be used as an alternative approach to study neurodegenerative diseases in the fly model.

In the D. repleta group, this class of enzymes was well described in cactophilic species, existing a lack of studies considering substrate speci city and life cycle expression in the non-cactophilic species. The larvae of cactophilic species of the D. repleta group develop in rotting cacti cladodes, but adults are generalists. Thus, different patterns expression can be found for esterases throughout development. In this work we analyzed esterase pro le and substrate speci city during development, and genetic variability aspects in D. mercatorum pararepleta, a non-cactophilic and generalist species of D. repleta group that was understudied hitherto. Samples of 3rd (F3) and 104th (F104) generations of three D. mercatorum pararepleta strains, obtained after collections in xerophytic enclaves of southeastern Brazil (ITI and SER in São Paulo state and RIP in Paraná state), and of D33 strain (obtained from Cristalina-GO, Midwest of Brazil, and established in the laboratory in 1987) were analyzed. Eight esterase loci, EST-1 to EST-8, were detected. EST-1 and EST-2 were adult exclusive. Only EST-3 and EST-8 were monomorphic; all the others presented between two (EST-6) and six (EST-7) alleles. EST-7 was the only dimeric locus and also the only one that showed to be a preferably β-esterase regarding affinity to α- and β-naphthyl acetates as substrates. The other seven loci were divided into three classes: α-esterase exclusive (EST-2); preferably α-esterase (EST-3, EST-4, EST-5 and EST-8); and α/β-esterase (EST-1 and EST-6). The EST-3, EST-5 and EST-6 loci were not detected in all samples, suggesting that they could have become pseudogenes due to the mutation accumulation after the gene duplication. The allele frequency of EST-7 locus, which showed the highest number of alleles, in adults of D33 and SER-F3 evidenced a higher variability and diversity in the oldest strain (six alleles, Ho = 0.46) than in the youngest ( five alleles, Ho = 0.26). Moreover, the analysis of SER-F104 revealed that this locus became monomorphic. The higher variability in the strain established in the laboratory at least two decades ago, together with the allele fixation in the SER-F104, indicate that the SER strain probably suffered a more severe action of founder effect/bottleneck when it was established in the laboratory and, therefore, even if the maintenance afterwards was performed using a high number of individuals, it did not assured the conservation of the existing genetic variability.",2017,"Jaqueline de Oliveira Prestes, Gabriela Ronchi Salomón, Daiane Biegai, Rogério Pincela Mateus, Luciana Paes de Barros Machado, Thais Wouk, Natalia Silva Alves"
Environmental complexity and the purging of deleterious alleles,28840604,10.1111/evo.13334,"Sexual interactions among adults can generate selection on both males and females with genome-wide consequences. Sexual selection through males is one component of this selection that has been argued to play an important role in purging deleterious alleles. A common technique to assess the influence of sexual selection is by a comparison of experimental evolution under enforced monogamy versus polygamy. Mixed results from past studies may be due to the use of highly simplified laboratory conditions that alter the nature of sexual interactions. Here, we examine the rate of purging of 22 gene disruption mutations in experimental polygamous populations of Drosophila melanogaster in each of two mating environments: a simple, high-density environment (i.e., typical fly vials), and a lower density, more spatially complex environment. Based on past work, we expect sexual interactions in the latter environment to result in stronger selection in both sexes. Consistent with this, we find that mutations tend to be purged more quickly in populations evolving in complex environments. We discuss possible mechanisms by which environmental complexity might modulate the rate at which deleterious alleles are purged and putatively ascribe a role for sexual interactions in explaining the treatment differences in our experiment.",2017,"Howard D Rundle, Amardeep Singh, Aneil F Agrawal"
"The KIF1A homolog Unc-104 is important for spontaneous release, postsynaptic density maturation and perisynaptic scaffold organization",28344334,10.1038/srep38172,"The kinesin-3 family member KIF1A has been shown to be important for experience dependent neuroplasticity. In Drosophila, amorphic mutations in the KIF1A homolog unc-104 disrupt the formation of mature boutons. Disease associated KIF1A mutations have been associated with motor and sensory dysfunctions as well as non-syndromic intellectual disability in humans. A hypomorphic mutation in the forkhead-associated domain of Unc-104, unc-104bris, impairs active zone maturation resulting in an increased fraction of post-synaptic glutamate receptor fields that lack the active zone scaffolding protein Bruchpilot. Here, we show that the unc-104brismutation causes defects in synaptic transmission as manifested by reduced amplitude of both evoked and miniature excitatory junctional potentials. Structural defects observed in the postsynaptic compartment of mutant NMJs include reduced glutamate receptor field size, and altered glutamate receptor composition. In addition, we observed marked loss of postsynaptic scaffolding proteins and reduced complexity of the sub-synaptic reticulum, which could be rescued by pre- but not postsynaptic expression of unc-104.

A multifaceted role for MOF histone modifying factor in genome maintenance,27038808,10.1016/j.mad.2016.03.012,"MOF (males absent on the first) was initially identified as a dosage compensation factor in Drosophila that acetylates lysine 16 of histone H4 (H4K16ac) and increased gene transcription from the single copy male X-chromosome. In humans, however, the ortholog of Drosophila MOF has been shown to interact with a range of proteins that extend its potential significance well beyond transcription. For example, recent results indicate MOF is an upstream regulator of the ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) protein, the loss of which is responsible for ataxia telangiectasia (AT). ATM is a key regulatory kinase that interacts with and phosphorylates multiple substrates that influence critical, cell-cycle control and DNA damage repair pathways in addition to other pathways.

Strategy changes in subsequent fights as consequences of winning and losing in fruit fly fights,27834611,10.1080/19336934.2016.1259041,"In competition for food, territory and mates, male fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) engage in agonistic encounters with conspecifics. The fighting strategies used to obtain these resources are influenced by previous and present experience, environmental cues, and the internal state of the animal including hormonal and genetic influences. Animals that experience prior defeats show submissive behavior and are more likely to lose 2nd contests, while animals that win 1st fights are more aggressive and have a higher probability of winning 2nd contests. In a recent report, we examined these loser and winner effects in greater detail and demonstrated that both winners and losers show short-term memory of the results of previous bouts while only losers demonstrate a longer-term memory that requires protein synthesis. The recent findings also suggested that an individual recognition mechanism likely exists that can serve important roles in evaluating the fighting ability of opponents and influencing future fighting strategy.

SNARE proteins play a role in motor axon guidance in vertebrates and invertebrates,28033683,10.1002/dneu.22481,"Axonal growth and guidance rely on correct growth cone responses to guidance cues, both in the central nervous system (CNS) and in the periphery. Unlike the signaling cascades that link axonal growth to cytoskeletal dynamics, little is known about the cross-talk mechanisms between guidance and membrane dynamics and turnover in the axon. Our studies have shown that Netrin-1/deleted in colorectal cancer signaling triggers exocytosis through the SNARE Syntaxin-1 (STX-1) during the formation of commissural pathways. However, limited in vivo evidence is available about the role of SNARE proteins in motor axonal guidance. Here we show that loss-of-function of SNARE complex members results in motor axon guidance defects in fly and chick embryos. Knock-down of Syntaxin-1, VAMP-2, and SNAP-25 leads to abnormalities in the motor axon routes out of the CNS.

MAPK signaling promotes axonal degeneration by speeding the turnover of the axonal maintenance factor NMNAT2,28095293,10.7554/eLife.22540,"Injury-induced (Wallerian) axonal degeneration is regulated via the opposing actions of pro-degenerative factors such as SARM1 and a MAPK signal and pro-survival factors, the most important of which is the NAD+ biosynthetic enzyme NMNAT2 that inhibits activation of the SARM1 pathway. Here we investigate the mechanism by which MAPK signaling facilitates axonal degeneration. We show that MAPK signaling promotes the turnover of the axonal survival factor NMNAT2 in cultured mammalian neurons as well as the Drosophila ortholog dNMNAT in motoneurons. The increased levels of NMNAT2 are required for the axonal protection caused by loss of MAPK signaling. Regulation of NMNAT2 by MAPK signaling does not require SARM1, and so cannot be downstream of SARM1. Hence, pro-degenerative MAPK signaling functions upstream of SARM1 by limiting the levels of the essential axonal survival factor NMNAT2 to promote injury-dependent SARM1 activation. These findings are consistent with a linear molecular pathway for the axonal degeneration program.",2017,"E J Brace, Daniel W Summers, Jeffrey Milbrandt, Lauren J Walker, Aaron DiAntonio, Yo Sasaki"
Adaptation to Chronic Nutritional Stress Leads to Reduced Dependence on Microbiota in Drosophila melanogaster,29066546,10.1128/mBio.01496-17,"Numerous studies have shown that animal nutrition is tightly linked to gut microbiota, especially under nutritional stress. In Drosophila melanogaster, microbiota are known to promote juvenile growth, development, and survival on poor diets, mainly through enhanced digestion leading to changes in hormonal signaling. Here, we show that this reliance on microbiota is greatly reduced in replicated Drosophila populations that became genetically adapted to a poor larval diet in the course of over 170 generations of experimental evolution. Protein and polysaccharide digestion in these poor-diet-adapted populations became much less dependent on colonization with microbiota. This was accompanied by changes in expression levels of dFOXO transcription factor, a key regulator of cell growth and survival, and many of its targets. These evolutionary changes in the expression of dFOXO targets to a large degree mimic the response of the same genes to microbiota, suggesting that the evolutionary adaptation to poor diet acted on mechanisms that normally mediate the response to microbiota. Our study suggests that some metazoans have retained the evolutionary potential to adapt their physiology such that association with microbiota may become optional rather than essential.IMPORTANCE Animals depend on gut microbiota for various metabolic tasks, particularly under conditions of nutritional stress, a relationship usually regarded as an inherent aspect of animal physiology. Here, we use experimental evolution in fly populations to show that the degree of host dependence on microbiota can substantially and rapidly change as the host population evolves in response to poor diet. Our results suggest that, although microbiota may initially greatly facilitate coping with suboptimal diets, chronic nutritional stress experienced over multiple generations leads to evolutionary adaptation in physiology and gut digestive properties that reduces dependence on the microbiota for growth and survival. Thus, despite its ancient evolutionary history, the reliance of animal hosts on their microbial partners can be surprisingly flexible and may be relaxed by short-term evolution.",2017,"Jan R van der Meer, Sylvain Kolly, Berra Erkosar, Tadeusz J Kawecki"
Evidence of neofunctionalization after the duplication of the highly conserved Polycomb group gene Caf1-55 in the obscura group of Drosophila,28094282,10.1038/srep40536,"Drosophila CAF1-55 protein is a subunit of the Polycomb repressive complex PRC2 and other protein complexes. It is a multifunctional and evolutionarily conserved protein that participates in nucleosome assembly and remodelling, as well as in the epigenetic regulation of a large set of target genes. Here, we describe and analyze the duplication of Caf1-55 in the obscura group of Drosophila. Paralogs exhibited a strong asymmetry in evolutionary rates, which suggests that they have evolved according to a neofunctionalization process. During this process, the ancestral copy has been kept under steady purifying selection to retain the ancestral function and the derived copy (Caf1-55dup) that originated via a DNA-mediated duplication event ~18 Mya, has been under clear episodic selection. Different maximum likelihood approaches confirmed the action of positive selection, in contrast to relaxed selection, on Caf1-55dup after the duplication. This adaptive process has also taken place more recently during the divergence of D. subobscura and D. guanche. The possible association of this duplication with a previously detected acceleration in the evolutionary rate of three CAF1-55 partners in PRC2 complexes is discussed.

Recurrent Innovation at Genes Required for Telomere Integrity in Drosophila,27836984,10.1093/molbev/msw248,"Telomeres are nucleoprotein complexes at the ends of linear chromosomes. These specialized structures ensure genome integrity and faithful chromosome inheritance. Recurrent addition of repetitive, telomere-specific DNA elements to chromosome ends combats end-attrition, while specialized telomere-associated proteins protect naked, double-stranded chromosome ends from promiscuous repair into end-to-end fusions. Although telomere length homeostasis and end-protection are ubiquitous across eukaryotes, there is sporadic but building evidence that the molecular machinery supporting these essential processes evolves rapidly. Nevertheless, no global analysis of the evolutionary forces that shape these fast-evolving proteins has been performed on any eukaryote. The abundant population and comparative genomic resources of Drosophila melanogaster and its close relatives offer us a unique opportunity to fill this gap. Here we leverage population genetics, molecular evolution, and phylogenomics to define the scope and evolutionary mechanisms driving fast evolution of genes required for telomere integrity. We uncover evidence of pervasive positive selection across multiple evolutionary timescales. We also document prolific expansion, turnover, and expression evolution in gene families founded by telomeric proteins. Motivated by the mutant phenotypes and molecular roles of these fast-evolving genes, we put forward four alternative, but not mutually exclusive, models of intra-genomic conflict that may play out at very termini of eukaryotic chromosomes.

The Drosophila indirect flight muscle myosin heavy chain isoform is insufficient to transform the jump muscle into a highly stretch-activated muscle type,27881413,10.1152/ajpcell.00284.2016,"Stretch activation (SA) is a delayed increase in force that enables high power and efficiency from a cyclically contracting muscle. SA exists in various degrees in almost all muscle types. In Drosophila, the indirect flight muscle (IFM) displays exceptionally high SA force production (FSA), whereas the jump muscle produces only minimal FSA We previously found that expressing an embryonic (EMB) myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoform in the jump muscle transforms it into a moderately SA muscle type and enables positive cyclical power generation. To investigate whether variation in MHC isoforms is sufficient to produce even higher FSA, we substituted the IFM MHC isoform (IFI) into the jump muscle. Surprisingly, we found that IFI only caused a 1.7-fold increase in FSA, less than half the increase previously observed with EMB, and only at a high Pi concentration, 16 mM. This IFI-induced FSA is much less than what occurs in IFM, relative to isometric tension, and did not enable positive cyclical power generation by the jump muscle. Both isometric tension and FSA of control fibers decreased with increasing Pi concentration. However, for IFI-expressing fibers, only isometric tension decreased. The rate of FSA generation was ~1.5-fold faster for IFI fibers than control fibers, and both rates were Pi dependent. We conclude that MHC isoforms can alter FSA and hence cyclical power generation but that isoforms can only endow a muscle type with moderate FSA Highly SA muscle types, such as IFM, likely use a different or additional mechanism.",2017,"Cuiping Zhao, Douglas M Swank"

PCP signaling is critical for development by establishing cellular asymmetries and orientation within the plane of an epithelium, via differential localization of distinct complexes of core PCP factors. Loss of APC/C function leads to reduced levels of Dishevelled (Dsh), a core PCP factor. The effect of APC/C on Dsh is mediated by Nek2 kinase, which can phosphorylate Dsh and is a direct APC/CFzr/Cdh1 substrate.

Various Wolbachia genotypes differently influence host Drosophila dopamine metabolism and survival under heat stress conditions,29297293,10.1186/s12862-017-1104-y,"Background: One of the most widespread prokaryotic symbionts of invertebrates is the intracellular bacteria of Wolbachia genus which can be found in about 50% of insect species. Wolbachia causes both parasitic and mutualistic effects on its host that include manipulating the host reproductive systems in order to increase their transmission through the female germline, and increasing the host fitness. One of the mechanisms, promoting adaptation in biological organisms, is a non-specific neuroendocrine stress reaction. In insects, this reaction includes catecholamines, dopamine, serotonin and octopamine, which act as neurotransmitters, neuromodulators and neurohormones. The level of dopamine metabolism correlates with heat stress resistance in Drosophila adults. Results: To examine Wolbachia effect on Drosophila survival under heat stress and dopamine metabolism we used five strains carrying the nuclear background of interbred Bi90 strain and cytoplasmic backgrounds with different genotype variants of Wolbachia (produced by 20 backcrosses of Bi90 males with appropriate source of Wolbachia). Non-infected Bi90 strain (treated with tetracycline for 3 generations) was used as a control group. We demonstrated that two of five investigated Wolbachia variants promote changes in Drosophila heat stress resistance and activity of enzymes that produce and degrade dopamine, alkaline phosphatase and dopamine-dependent arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase. What is especially interesting, wMelCS genotype of Wolbachia increases stress resistance and the intensity of dopamine metabolism, whereas wMelPop strain decreases them. wMel, wMel2 and wMel4 genotypes of Wolbachia do not show any effect on the survival under heat stress or dopamine metabolism. L-DOPA treatment, known to increase the dopamine content in Drosophila, levels the difference in survival under heat stress between all studied groups.

The hobo transposable element has transposase-dependent and -independent excision activity in drosophilid species,7770046,10.1007/BF00293140,"Mobility of the hobo transposable element was determined for several strains of Drosophila melanogaster and several Drosophila species. Mobility was assessed by use of an in vivo transient assay in the soma of developing embryos, which monitored hobo excision from injected indicator plasmids. Excision was detected in a D. melanogaster strain (cn; ry42) devoid of endogenous hobo elements only after co-injection of a helper plasmid containing functional hobo transposase under either heat shock or normal promoter regulation. Excision was also detected in D. melanogaster without helper in strains known to contain genomic copies of hobo. In Drosophila species confirmed not to contain hobo, hobo excision occurred at significant rates both in the presence and absence of co-injected helper plasmid. In four of the seven species tested, excision frequencies were two- to fivefold lower in the presence of plasmid-borne hobo, hobo excision donor sites were sequenced in indicator plasmids extracted from D. melanogaster cn; ry42 and D. virilis embryos. In the presence of hobo transposase, the predominant excision sites were identical in both species, having breakpoints at the hobo termini with an inverted duplication of proximal insertion site DNA. However, in the absence of hobo transposase in D. virilis, excision breakpoints were apparently random and occurred distal to the hobo termini. The data indicate that hobo is capable of functioning in the soma during embryogenesis, and that its mobility is unrestricted in drosophilids. Furthermore, drosophilids not containing hobo are able to mobilize hobo, presumably by a hobo-related cross-mobilizing system. The cross-mobilizing system in D. virilis is not functionally identical to hobo with respect to excision sequence specificity.",1995,"S P Gomez, A M Handler"

DHR96 is also 20E-inducible, and its encoded protein binds selectively to the hsp27 20E response element.

Cell fate specification by even-skipped expression in the Drosophila nervous system is coupled to cell cycle progression,8582283,,"The correct specification of defined neurons in the Drosophila central nervous system is dependent on even-skipped. During CNS development, even-skipped expression starts in the ganglion mother cell resulting from the first asymmetric division of neuroblast NB 1-1. This first division of NB 1-1 (and of the other early neuroblasts as well) is temporally controlled by the transcriptional regulation of string expression, which we have manipulated experimentally, even-skipped expression still occurs if the first neuroblast division is delayed, but not if the division is prohibited. Moreover, even-skipped expression is also dependent on progression through S phase which follows immediately after the first division. However, cytokinesis during the first NB division is not required for even-skipped expression as revealed by observations in pebble mutant embryos. Our results demonstrate therefore that even-skipped expression is coupled to cell cycle progression, presumably in order to prevent a premature activation of expression by a positive regulator which is produced already in the neuroblast during G2 and segregated asymmetrically into the ganglion mother cell during mitosis.",1995,"K Weigmann, C F Lehner"

Cloning and characterization of the white gene from Anopheles gambiae,8825759,10.1111/j.1365-2583.1995.tb00027.x,"A 14 kb region of genomic DNA containing the X-linked Anopheles gambiae eye colour gene, white, was cloned and sequenced. Genomic clones containing distinct white+ alleles were polymorphic for the insertion of a small transposable element in intron 3, and differed at 1% of nucleotide positions compared. Sequence was also determined from a rare 2914 bp cDNA. Comparison of cDNA and genomic sequences established an intron-exon structure distinct from Drosophila white. Despite a common trend in Anopheles and Drosophila of weak codon bias given low levels of gene expression, codon usage by Anopheles gambiae white was strongly biased. Overall amino acid identity between the predicted mosquito and fruitfly proteins was 64%, but dropped to 14% at the amino terminus. To correlate phenotypically white-eyed strains of A. gambiae with structural lesions in white, five available strains were analysed by PCR and Southern blotting. Although these strains carried allelic mutations, independently generated by gamma radiation (three strains) or spontaneous events (two strains), no white lesions were detected. Significantly, another non-allelic X-linked mutation, causing an identical white-eyed phenotype, has been correlated with a structural defect in the cloned white gene (Benedict et al., 1995). Taken together, these observations suggest that the white-eyed mutants analysed in the present study carry mutations in a second eye colour gene and are most likely white+.",1995,"O Mukabayire, M Q Benedict, N J Besansky, F H Collins, J A Bedell, D Hilfiker"

Subunit structure of mitochondrial DNA polymerase from Drosophila embryos. Physical and immunological studies,7499423,10.1074/jbc.270.48.28932,"The subunit structure of mitochondrial DNA polymerase from Drosophila embryos has been examined by a combination of physical and immunological methods. A highly specific rabbit antiserum directed against the native enzyme was developed and found to recognize specifically its two subunits in immunoblot and immunoprecipitation analyses. That and the potent inhibition by the rabbit antiserum of the DNA polymerase and 3'-->5' exonuclease activities of the nearly homogeneous mitochondrial DNA polymerase provide strong evidence for the physical association of the 3'-->5' exonuclease with the two subunit enzyme. An immunoprecipitation analysis of crude enzyme fractions showed that the two subunits of Drosophila mitochondrial DNA polymerase are intact, and an in situ gel proteolysis analysis showed that they are structurally distinct. Template-primer DNA binding studies demonstrated formation of a stable and discrete enzyme-DNA complex in the absence of accessory proteins. Photochemical cross-linking of the complexes by UV light indicated that the alpha but not the beta subunit of mitochondrial DNA polymerase makes close contact with DNA, and limited digestion of the native enzyme with trypsin showed that an approximately 65-kDa proteolytic fragment of the alpha subunit retains the DNA binding function.",1995,"Y Wang, R H Elder, M W Olson, L S Kaguni"

"Cellular effects of olomoucine, an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases",7549905,10.1016/0248-4900(96)81298-6,"Olomoucine (2-(2-hydroxyethylamino)-6-benzylamino-9-methylpurine) has been recently described as a competitive inhibitor (ATP-binding site) of the cell cycle regulating p34cdc2/cyclin B, p33cdk2/cyclin A and p33cdk2/cyclin E kinases, the brain p33cdk5/p35 kinase and the ERK1/MAP-kinase. The unusual specificity of this compound towards cell cycle regulating enzymes suggests that it could inhibit certain steps of the cell cycle. The cellular effects of olomoucine were investigated in a large variety of plant and animal models. This compound inhibits the G1/S transition of unicellular algae (dinoflagellate and diatom). It blocks Fucus zygote cleavage and development of Laminaria gametophytes. Stimulated Petunia mesophyl protoplasts are arrested in G1 by olomoucine. By arresting cleavage it blocks the Laminaria gametophytes. Stimulated Petunia mesophyl protoplasts are arrested in G1 by olomoucine. By arresting cleavage it blocks the development of Calanus copepod larvae. It reversibly inhibits the early cleavages of Caenorhabditis elegans embryos and those of ascidian embryos. Olomoucine inhibits the serotonin-induced prophase/metaphase transition of clam oocytes; furthermore, it triggers the the release of these oocytes from their meiotic metaphase I arrest, and induces nuclei reformation. Olomoucine slows down the prophase/metaphase transition in cleaving sea urchin embryos, but does not affect the duration of the metaphase/anaphase and anaphase/telophase transitions. It also inhibits the prophase/metaphase transition of starfish oocytes triggered by various agonists. Xenopus oocyte maturation, the in vivo and in vitro phosphorylation of elongation factor EF-1 are inhibited by olomoucine. Mouse oocyte maturation is delayed by this compound, whereas parthenogenetic release from metaphase II arrest is facilitated. Growth of a variety of human cell lines (rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines Rh1, Rh18, Rh28 and Rh30; MCF-7, KB-3-1 and their adriamycin-resistant counterparts; National Cancer Institute 60 human tumor cell lines comprising nine tumor types) is inhibited by olomoucine. Cell cycle parameter analysis of the non-small cell lung cancer cell line MR65 shows that olomoucine affects G1 and S phase transits. Olomoucine inhibits DNA synthesis in interleukin-2-stimulated T lymphocytes (CTLL-2 cells) and triggers a G1 arrest similar to interleukin-2 deprivation. Both cdc2 and cdk2 kinases (immunoprecipitated from nocodazole- and hydroxyurea-treated CTLL-2 cells, respectively) are inhibited by olomoucine. Both yeast and Drosophila embryos were insensitive to olomoucine. Taken together the results of this Noah's Ark approach show that olomoucine arrests cells both at the G1/S and the G2/M boundaries, consistent with the hypothesis of a prevalent effect on the cdk2 and cdc2 kinases, respectively.",1995,"A Andersen, R T Abraham, M Acquarone, F Berger, D Fagot, C Buquet-Fagot, A Asensi, C Bergounioux, R Bellé, G Brunn"
The larval optic nerve is required for the development of an identified serotonergic arborization in Drosophila melanogaster,7781904,10.1006/dbio.1995.1175,"The larval visual system in the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster consists of two bilateral clusters of 12 photoreceptor cells. These neurons send their axons in a fascicle, the Bolwig's nerve, toward the target area in the ventral lateral region of the brain hemispheres. We describe the development of a serotonergic arborization originating in the central brain found in the larval optic center in association with the larval optic nerve. This arborization is formed by processes from larval neurons born during embryogenesis. However, these neuronal processes do not reach their final destination, the larval optic center, until late in larval development. Using mutations that disrupt the connectivity and/or development of the larval photoreceptor cells, as well as mosaic analysis, we demonstrate that the innervation of the larval optic center by this serotonergic arborization depends upon contact with the larval optic nerve.",1995,"M Mukhopadhyay, A R Campos"
Activation of protein kinase C alpha inhibits signaling by members of the insulin receptor family,7545165,10.1074/jbc.270.37.21600,"Stimulation of the activity of protein kinase C by pretreatment of cells with phorbol esters was tested for its ability to inhibit signaling by four members of the insulin receptor family, including the human insulin and insulin-like growth factor-I receptors, the human insulin receptor-related receptor, and the Drosophila insulin receptor. Activation of overexpressed protein kinase C alpha resulted in a subsequent inhibition of the ligand-stimulated increase in antiphosphotyrosine-precipitable phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase mediated by the kinase domains of all four receptors. This inhibition varied from 97% for the insulin receptor-related receptor to 65% for the Drosophila insulin receptor. In addition, the activation of protein kinase C alpha inhibited the in situ ligand-stimulated increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of the GTPase-activating protein-associated p60 protein as well as Shc mediated by these receptors. The mechanism for this inhibition was further studied in the case of the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor. Although the in situ phosphorylation of insulin-receptor substrate-1 and p60 by this receptor was inhibited by prior stimulation of protein kinase C alpha, the in vitro tyrosine phosphorylation of these two substrates by this receptor was not decreased by prior stimulation of the protein kinase C alpha in the cells that served as a source of the substrates. Finally, the insulin-like growth factor-I-stimulated increase in cell proliferation was found to be inhibited by prior activation of protein kinase C alpha.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1995,"Y Hosomi, F Liu, A G Danielsen, K Shii, R A Roth"
Sequential gene activation by ecdysone in Drosophila melanogaster: the hierarchical equivalence of early and early late genes,7743931,,"Ecdysteroids are key regulators of insect development. In Drosophila melanogaster the late larval response to ecdysone is characterised by a precise sequential activation of members of the superfamily of nuclear receptors (DHR3, DHR39, EcR, E75, E78, FTZ-F1, usp). Many of these genes are localised in the polytene chromosome puffs of the salivary gland previously classified as intermoult, early or early-late puff loci. Ashburner et al. (Ashburner, M., Chihara, C., Meltzer, P. and Richards, G. (1974) Cold Spring Harbour Symp. Quant. Biol. 38, 655-662) proposed a formal model describing interactions between ecdysone, its receptor and the early and late puffs during this ecdysone response. To integrate transcripts from the intermoult and early-late puffs into this model, we have used a micro RT-PCR assay to study their hormonal regulation using salivary gland culture protocols first used in the puffing analyses. We show that transcripts from certain early-late puffs are induced in parallel with the early transcripts and are thus hierarchically equivalent. In vivo the profile of the increase in hormone titre, the sensitivity of different promoters to hormone and the rate of transcript accumulation must contribute to the temporal differences in expression observed between these two classes.",1995,"C Ruiz, G Richards, F Huet"

The protein is also a 5'-to-3' exonuclease active on DNA and RNA. Multiple roles for the in vivo function of Sep1, ranging from DNA recombination and cytoskeleton to RNA turnover, have been proposed. We show that Sep1 is an abundant protein in vegetative S. cerevisiae cells, present at about 80,000 molecules per diploid cell. Protein levels were not changed during the cell cycle or in response to DNA-damaging agents but increased twofold during meiosis. Cell fractionation and indirect immunofluorescence studies indicated that > 90% of Sep1 was cytoplasmic in vegetative cells, and indirect immunofluorescence indicated a cytoplasmic localization in meiotic cells as well. The localization supports the proposal that Sep1 has a role in cytoplasmic RNA metabolism.

Our genetic analysis showed ksr-1 positively mediates Ras signaling and functions downstream of or in parallel to let-60. In the absence of ksr-1 function, normal Ras signaling is impaired only slightly, suggesting ksr-1 may act to modulate, or in a branch that diverges from, the main signaling pathway. The predicted KSR-1 protein has a protein kinase domain and is most similar to a recently identified Drosophila protein involved in Ras signaling. We propose that the function of ksr-1 is evolutionarily conserved.",1995,"H R Horvitz, D B Hom, K Kornfeld"
Visual pattern memory without shape recognition,8668723,10.1098/rstb.1995.0100,"Visual pattern memory of Drosophila melanogaster at the torque meter is investigated by a new learning paradigm called novelty choice.

Figures presented during training are not recognized as familiar in the test, if displayed (i) at a different height, (ii) at a different size, (iii) rotated or (iv) after contrast reversal. No special invariance mechanisms are found. A pixel-by-pixel matching process is sufficient to explain the observed data. Minor transfer effects can be explained if a graded similarity function is assumed. Recognition depends upon the overlap between the stored template and the actual image. The similarity function is best described by the ratio of the area of overlap to the area of the actual image. The similarity function is independent of the geometrical properties of the employed figures. Visual pattern memory at this basic level does not require the analysis of shape.",1995,"M Dill, M Heisenberg"

This recombinant contained a Drosophila melanogaster heat shock 70 promoter driving an Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase (Lac-Z) reporter gene to monitor the presence of early viral gene expression and a second reporter gene, the E. coli beta-glucuronidase (GUS) gene, under control of the very late AcNPV p10 promoter to monitor viral replication. In S. exigua larvae, permissive Spodoptera spp. cultured cells, and nonpermissive D. melanogaster cultured cells early viral gene expression was indicated by the appearance of Lac-Z as early as 3 hr p.i. Late viral gene expression was indicated by the appearance of GUS and occurred only in the permissive cultured cells and larvae. Early and late viral gene expression could be detected simultaneously using differential enzyme histochemistry. Analysis of infected S. exigua larvae revealed that midgut columnar cells and, at a low frequency, midgut regenerative cells were the primary sites of infection. Parental nucleocapsids were apparently transported through columnar cells to underlaying regenerative cells before virus replication and progeny production. Infection of tissues beside the midgut epithelium was not detected prior to viral replication within the midgut, suggesting that infection of the midgut is an important prelude to systemic infection.",1995,"J T Flipsen, M M van Oers, J M Vlak, J W van Lent, J W Martens"

As a consequence, the adult mnb brain exhibits a specific and marked size reduction of the optic lobes and central brain hemispheres. The insufficient number of distinct neurons in mnb brains is correlated with specific abnormalities in visual and olfactory behavior.

Characterization of the dopa decarboxylase gene of Manduca sexta and its suppression by 20-hydroxyecdysone,7750638,10.1006/dbio.1995.1137,"Manduca dopa decarboxylase (DDC) cDNA was isolated, sequenced, and found to be most closely related to Drosophila DDC (72% amino acid identity). Culture of Day 2 fourth instar larval epidermis with 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) showed that 20E was necessary to determine the later expression of the gene, but its removal was required for this expression to occur. Experiments with the protein synthesis inhibitors, cycloheximide and anisomycin, and the mRNA synthesis inhibitor, alpha-amanitin, showed that 20E induced a protein(s) which suppressed transcription of the DDC gene. Gel mobility shift assays using epidermal extracts and various fragments of the first 1.1 kb of the 5' flanking region of the DDC gene showed only one DNA fragment 87 to 167 bp upstream of the 5' initiation site that bound a nuclear protein(s) with the expected developmental specificity. The protein was abundant at the time of high ecdysteroid titer when no DDC mRNA was present, but low both before the rise (no DDC mRNA) and after the decline of ecdysteroid titer (maximal DDC mRNA). Thus, this protein(s) is a candidate for an ecdysteroid-induced transcription factor which acts to suppress DDC transcription.

In situ quantification of hsp70 and alpha-beta transcripts at 87A and 87C loci in relation to hsr-omega gene activity in polytene cells of Drosophila melanogaster,7551555,10.1007/BF00710021,"The hsp70-coding duplicate loci at the 87A and 87C sites (the 87C site also carries heat-inducible alpha-beta repeats) in polytene nuclei are known to puff to different levels under conditions in which heat shock does not induce the non-protein-coding hsr-omega gene at the 93D site. To understand the basis of this unequal puffing, the levels of hsp70 and alpha-beta transcripts at the 87A and 87C heat shock loci in polytene chromosomes of Drosophila melanogaster were quantified in situ by hybridization of antisense RNA probes after treatment with heat shock, benzamide, colchicine, heat shock followed by benzamide or heat shock in the presence of colchicine in salivary glands of late third instar larvae. Heat shock, resulting in equal puffing of the 87A and 87C loci, increased the hsp70 transcripts at both sites in proportion to the numbers of hsp70 gene copies at the two loci; levels of alpha-beta transcripts were also elevated at the 87C site following heat shock. Heat shock followed by benzamide treatment, which results in a larger puff at 87A, caused an increase in hsp70 transcripts per gene copy at 87A and a decrease at 87C without any effect on the alpha-beta transcripts; heat shock in the presence of colchicine, which causes the 87C puff to be larger than 87A, resulted in a decrease in hsp70 RNA at 87A but an increase in the levels of hsp70 as well as alpha-beta transcripts at the 87C site.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1995,"A Sharma, S C Lakhotia"

Genetic and molecular analysis of the autosomal component of the primary sex determination signal of Drosophila melanogaster,8601486,,"Drosophila sex is determined by the action of the X:A chromosome balance on transcription of Sex-lethal (Sxl), a feminizing switch gene. We obtained loss-of-function mutations in denominator elements of the X:A signal by selecting for dominant suppressors of a female-specific lethal mutation in the numerator element, sisterlessA (sisA). Ten suppressors were recovered in this extensive genome-wide selection. All were mutations in deadpan (dpn), a pleiotropic locus previously discovered to be a denominator element. Detailed genetic and molecular characterization is presented of this diverse set of new dpn alleles including their effects on Sxl. Although selected only for impairment of sex-specific functions, all were also impaired in nonsex-specific functions. Male-lethal effects were anticipated for mutations in a major denominator element, but we found that viability of males lacking dpn function was reduced no more than 50% relative to their dpn- sisters. Moreover, loss of dpn activity in males caused only a modest derepression of the Sxl ""establishment"" promoter (Sxlpe), the X:A target. By itself, dpn cannot account for the masculinizing effect of increased autosomal ploidy, the effect that gave rise to the concept of the X:A ratio; nevertheless, if there are other denominator elements, our results suggest that their individual contributions to the sex-determination signal are even less than that of dpn. The time course of expression of dpn and of Sxl in dpn mutant backgrounds suggests that dpn is required for sex determination only during the later stages of X:A signaling in males to prevent inappropriate expression of Sxlpe in the face of increasing sis gene product levels.",1995,"T W Cline, D A Barbash"

FYCO1 mediates clearance of α-synuclein aggregates through a Rab7-dependent mechanism,29747217,10.1111/jnc.14461,"Parkinson's disease can be caused by mutations in the α-synuclein gene and is characterized by aggregates of α-synuclein protein. We have previously shown that over-expression of the small GTPase Rab7 can induce clearance of α-synuclein aggregates. In this study, we investigate which Rab7 effectors mediate this effect. To model Parkinson's disease, we expressed the pathogenic A53T mutant of α-synuclein in HEK293T cells and Drosophila melanogaster. We tested the Rab7 effectors FYVE and coiled-coil domain-containing protein 1 (FYCO1) and Rab-interacting lysosomal protein (RILP). FYCO1-EGFP-decorated vesicles containing α-synuclein. RILP-EGFP also decorated vesicular structures, but they did not contain α-synuclein. FYCO1 over-expression reduced the number of cells with α-synuclein aggregates, defined as visible particles of EGFP-tagged α-synuclein, whereas RILP did not. FYCO1 but not RILP reduced the amount of α-synuclein protein as assayed by western blot, increased the disappearance of α-synuclein aggregates in time-lapse microscopy and decreased α-synuclein-induced toxicity assayed by the Trypan blue assay. siRNA-mediated knockdown of FYCO1 but not RILP reduced Rab7-induced aggregate clearance. Collectively, these findings indicate that FYCO1 and not RILP mediates Rab7-induced aggregate clearance. The effect of FYCO1 on aggregate clearance was blocked by dominant negative Rab7 indicating that FYCO1 requires active Rab7 to function. Electron microscopic analysis and insertion of lysosomal membranes into the plasma membrane indicate that FYCO1 could lead to secretion of α-synuclein aggregates. Extracellular α-synuclein as assayed by ELISA was, however, not increased with FYCO1. Coexpression of FYCO1 in the fly model decreased α-synuclein aggregates as shown by the filter trap assay and rescued the locomotor deficit resulting from neuronal A53T-α-synuclein expression. This latter finding confirms that a pathway involving Rab7 and FYCO1 stimulates degradation of α-synuclein and could be beneficial in patients with Parkinson's disease.

Dietary Lipids Modulate Notch Signaling and Influence Adult Intestinal Development and Metabolism in Drosophila,30220569,10.1016/j.devcel.2018.08.013,"Tissue homeostasis involves a complex balance of developmental signals and environmental cues that dictate stem cell function. We found that dietary lipids control enteroendocrine cell production from Drosophila posterior midgut stem cells. Dietary cholesterol influences new intestinal cell differentiation in an Hr96-dependent manner by altering the level and duration of Notch signaling. Exogenous lipids modulate Delta ligand and Notch extracellular domain stability and alter their trafficking in endosomal vesicles. Lipid-modulated Notch signaling occurs in other nutrient-dependent tissues, suggesting that Delta trafficking in many cells is sensitive to cellular sterol levels. These diet-mediated alterations in young animals contribute to a metabolic program that persists after the diet changes. A low-sterol diet also slows the proliferation of enteroendocrine tumors initiated by Notch pathway disruption. Thus, a specific dietary nutrient can modify a key intercellular signaling pathway to shift stem cell differentiation and cause lasting changes in tissue structure and physiology.",2018,"Matthew Sieber, Rebecca Obniski, Allan C Spradling"
GATA factor genes in the Drosophila midgut embryo,29518114,10.1371/journal.pone.0193612,"The Drosophila GATA factor gene serpent (srp) is required for the early differentiation of the anterior and posterior midgut primordia. In particular, srp is sufficient and necessary for the primordial gut cells to undertake an epithelial-to-mesenchimal transition (EMT). Two other GATA factor genes, dGATAe and grain (grn), are also specifically expressed in the midgut. On the one hand, dGATAe expression is activated by srp. Embryos homozygous for a deficiency uncovering dGATAe were shown to lack the expression of some differentiated midgut genes. Moreover, ectopic expression of dGATAe was sufficient to drive the expression of some of these differentiation marker genes, thus establishing the role of dGATAe in the regulation of their expression. However, due to the gross abnormalities associated with this deficiency, it was not possible to assess whether, similarly to srp, dGATAe might play a role in setting the midgut morphology. To further investigate this role we decided to generate a dGATAe mutant. On the other hand, grn is expressed in the midgut primordia around stage 11 and remains expressed until the end of embryogenesis. Yet, no midgut function has been described for grn. First, here we report that, as for dGATAe, midgut grn expression is dependent on srp; conversely, dGATAe and grn expression are independent of each other. Our results also indicate that, unlike srp, dGATAe and grn are not responsible for setting the general embryonic midgut morphology. We also show that the analysed midgut genes whose expression is lacking in embryos homozygous for a deficiency uncovering dGATAe are indeed dGATAe-dependent genes. Conversely, we do not find any midgut gene to be grn-dependent, with the exception of midgut repression of the proventriculus iroquois (iro) gene. In conclusion, our results clarify the expression patterns and function of the GATA factor genes expressed in the embryonic midgut.",2018,"Jordi Casanova, Beatriz Hernández de Madrid"
Bub1 Facilitates Virus Entry through Endocytosis in a Model of Drosophila Pathogenesis,29976667,10.1128/JVI.00254-18,"In order to establish productive infection and dissemination, viruses usually evolve a number of strategies to hijack and/or subvert the host defense systems. However, host factors utilized by the virus to facilitate infection remain poorly characterized. In this work, we found that Drosophila melanogaster deficient in budding uninhibited by benzimidazoles 1 (bub1), a highly conserved subunit of the kinetochore complex regulating chromosome congression (1), became resistant to Drosophila C virus (DCV) infection, evidenced in increased survival rates and reduced viral loads, compared to the wild-type control. Mechanistic analysis further showed that Bub1 also functioned in the cytoplasm and was essentially involved in clathrin-dependent endocytosis of DCV and other pathogens, thus limiting pathogen entry. DCV infection potentially had strengthened the interaction between Bub1 and the clathrin adaptor on the cell membrane. Furthermore, the conserved function of Bub1 was also verified in a mammalian cell line. Thus, our data demonstrated a previously unknown function of Bub1 that could be hijacked by pathogens to facilitate their infection and spread.IMPORTANCE In this work, we identify for the first time that the nuclear protein Bub1 (budding uninhibited by benzimidazoles 1), a highly conserved subunit of the kinetochore complex regulating chromosome congression, has a novel and important function on the cell membrane to facilitate the virus to enter host cells. Bub1 deficiency empowers the host to have the ability to resist viral infection in Drosophila and a human cell line. Bub1 is involved in the virus entry step through regulating endocytosis. The DCV capsid protein can recruit Bub1, and DCV infection can strengthen the interaction between Bub1 and a clathrin-dependent endocytosis component. The restricted entry of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and Listeria monocytogenes in bub1-deficient flies and cell lines was also observed. Therefore, our data implicate a previously unknown function of Bub1 that can be hijacked by pathogens to facilitate their entry, and Bub1 may serve as a potential antiviral therapy target for limiting viral entry.",2018,"Junjing Yu, Zhiqin Fan, Lei Pan, Hong Tang, Si-Tang Gong, Shuo Yang"
Kinesin Khc-73/KIF13B modulates retrograde BMP signaling by influencing endosomal dynamics at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction,29373576,10.1371/journal.pgen.1007184,"Retrograde signaling is essential for neuronal growth, function and survival; however, we know little about how signaling endosomes might be directed from synaptic terminals onto retrograde axonal pathways. We have identified Khc-73, a plus-end directed microtubule motor protein, as a regulator of sorting of endosomes in Drosophila larval motor neurons. The number of synaptic boutons and the amount of neurotransmitter release at the Khc-73 mutant larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ) are normal, but we find a significant decrease in the number of presynaptic release sites. This defect in Khc-73 mutant larvae can be genetically enhanced by a partial genetic loss of Bone Morphogenic Protein (BMP) signaling or suppressed by activation of BMP signaling in motoneurons. Consistently, activation of BMP signaling that normally enhances the accumulation of phosphorylated form of BMP transcription factor Mad in the nuclei, can be suppressed by genetic removal of Khc-73. Using a number of assays including live imaging in larval motor neurons, we show that loss of Khc-73 curbs the ability of retrograde-bound endosomes to leave the synaptic area and join the retrograde axonal pathway. Our findings identify Khc-73 as a regulator of endosomal traffic at the synapse and modulator of retrograde BMP signaling in motoneurons.",2018,"Grant Kauwe, A Pejmun Haghighi, Wassim El-Mounzer, Sarah Farzin, Edward H Liao, Kazuya Tsurudome, Fatima Elazzouzi, Lindsay Gray, Christopher Baim, Mario R Calderon"

Caffeic acid and resveratrol ameliorate cellular damage in cell and Drosophila models of spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 through upregulation of Nrf2 pathway,29247688,10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2017.12.011,"Polyglutamine (polyQ)-expanded mutant ataxin-3 protein, which is prone to misfolding and aggregation, leads to cerebellar neurotoxicity in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), an inherited PolyQ neurodegenerative disease. Although the exact mechanism is unknown, the pathogenic effects of mutant ataxin-3 are associated with dysregulation of transcription, protein degradation, mitochondrial function, apoptosis, and antioxidant potency. In the present study we explored the protective role and possible mechanism of caffeic acid (CA) and resveratrol (Res) in cells and Drosophila expressing mutant ataxin-3. Treatment with CA and Res increased the levels of antioxidant and autophagy protein expression with consequently corrected levels of reactive oxygen species, mitochondrial membrane potential, mutant ataxin-3, and the aggregation of mutant ataxin-3 in SK-N-SH-MJD78 cells. Moreover, in SK-N-SH-MJD78 cells, CA and Res enhanced the transcriptional activity of nuclear factor erythroid-derived-2-like 2 (Nrf2), a master transcription factor that upregulates the expression of antioxidant defense genes and the autophagy gene p62. CA and Res improved survival and motor performance in SCA3 Drosophila. Additionally, the above-mentioned protective effects of CA were also observed in CA-supplemented SCA3 Drosophila. Notably, blockade of the Nrf2 pathway by use of small interfering RNA annulled the health effects of CA and Res on SCA3, which affirmed the importance of the increase in Nrf2 activation by CA and Res.

Cellular reprogramming: A new way to understand aging mechanisms,29350802,10.1002/wdev.308,"Increased life expectancy, due to the rise in life quality and the decline in mortality rates, is leading to a society in which the population aged 60 and over is growing more rapidly than the entire population. Although various models and model organisms have been employed to investigate the mechanism of aging, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are useful candidates to study human aging and age-related human diseases. This work discusses how iPSCs can be used as an alternative to the model organisms such as yeast, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, or the mouse. The main focus is the reprogramming technology of somatic cells which is thought to provide an important perspective for rejuvenation strategies. The effects and relationships between aging and cell reprogramming are discussed, and studies related to aging and cell reprogramming are critically reviewed. We believe that for future studies, different parameters and detailed quantitative experiments should be performed in order to clearly understand the effect of aging on human cell reprogramming with respect to programming efficiency and differentiation capacity.

The imbalance of serotonergic circuitry impairing the crop supercontractile muscle activity and the mitochondrial morphology of PD PINK1 B9 Drosophila melanogaster are rescued by Mucuna pruriens,30393142,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2018.10.007,"Despite its great potentiality, little attention has been paid to modelling gastrointestinal symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) in Drosophila melanogaster (Dm).

In this communication, we provide new information on the effect of Mpe on basal and serotonin treated contractions in the crop (i.e., an important and essential part of the gut) in Drosophila PD mutant for PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1B9) gene. The effect of Mpe on PINK1B9 supplied with standard diet to larvae and/or adults, were assayed on 10-15 days old flies. Conversely from what we observed in the wild type flies, recordings demonstrated that exogenous applications of serotonin on crop muscles of untreated PINK1B9 affect neither the frequency nor the amplitude of the crop contraction, while the same muscle parameters are enhanced following brain injections of serotonin, thus suggesting that PINK1B9 mutants may likely have an impairment in the serotonergic pathways. Also, the mitochondrial morphology in the crop muscles is strongly compromised, as demonstrated by the transmission electron microscopy analysis. The Mpe treatment rescued the crop muscle parameters and also the mitochondrial morphology when supplied to both larvae and adults. Overall, this study strengthens the relevance of using PINK1B9 Dm as a translational model to study the gastrointestinal symptoms in PD and also confirms the useful employment of M. pruriens for PD treatment.",2018,"Tiziano Catelani, Roberto Marotta, Doriana Debellis, Stefania Peddio, Patrizia Muroni, Sanjay Kasture, Anna Liscia, Paolo Solari, John G Stoffolano Jr, Biancamaria Baroli, Paolo Solla, Riccardo Maccioni"

Quantitative Morphological Variation in the Developing Drosophila Wing,29844017,10.1534/g3.118.200372,"Quantitative genetic variation in morphology is pervasive in all species and is the basis for the evolution of differences among species. The measurement of morphological form in adults is now beginning to be combined with comparable measurements of form during development. Here we compare the shape of the developing wing to its adult form in a holometabolous insect, Drosophila melanogaster We used protein expression patterns to measure shape in the developing precursors of the final adult wing. Three developmental stages were studied: late larval third instar, post-pupariation and in the adult fly. We studied wild-type animals in addition to mutants of two genes (shf and ds) that have known effects on adult wing shape and size. Despite experimental noise related to the difficulty of comparing developing structures, we found consistent differences in wing shape and size at each developmental stage between genotypes. Quantitative comparisons of variation arising at different developmental stages with the variation in the final structure enable us to determine when variation arises, and to generate hypotheses about the causes of that variation. In addition we provide linear rules allowing us to link wing morphology in the larva, with wing morphology in the pupa. Our approach provides a framework to analyze quantitative morphological variation in the developing fly wing. This framework should help to characterize the natural variation of the larval and pupal wing shape, and to measure the contribution of the processes occurring during these developmental stages to the natural variation in adult wing morphology.",2018,"Osamu Shimmi, Alexis Matamoro-Vidal, Yunxian Huang, David Houle, Isaac Salazar-Ciudad"
Repeated Failure in Reward Pursuit Alters Innate Drosophila Larval Behaviors,29951979,10.1007/s12264-018-0248-0,"Animals always seek rewards and the related neural basis has been well studied. However, what happens when animals fail to get a reward is largely unknown, although this is commonly seen in behaviors such as predation. Here, we set up a behavioral model of repeated failure in reward pursuit (RFRP) in Drosophila larvae. In this model, the larvae were repeatedly prevented from reaching attractants such as yeast and butyl acetate, before finally abandoning further attempts. After giving up, they usually showed a decreased locomotor speed and impaired performance in light avoidance and sugar preference, which were named as phenotypes of RFRP states. In larvae that had developed RFRP phenotypes, the octopamine concentration was greatly elevated, while tβh mutants devoid of octopamine were less likely to develop RFRP phenotypes, and octopamine feeding efficiently restored such defects. By down-regulating tβh in different groups of neurons and imaging neuronal activity, neurons that regulated the development of RFRP states and the behavioral exhibition of RFRP phenotypes were mapped to a small subgroup of non-glutamatergic and glutamatergic octopaminergic neurons in the central larval brain.

This sequence includes assembly of nascent arrays after an initial period of intensive microfilament synthesis, followed by array elongation, primarily from filament pointed-ends, radial growth of the arrays via recruitment of peripheral filaments and continuous barbed-end turnover. Using genetic approaches we have identified Fhos, the single Drosophila homolog of the FHOD sub-family of formins, as a primary and versatile mediator of IFM thin-filament organization.

AMP-activated protein kinase has diet-dependent and -independent roles in Drosophila oogenesis,27729213,10.1016/j.ydbio.2016.10.006,"Multiple aspects of organismal physiology influence the number and activity of stem cells and their progeny, including nutritional status. Previous studies demonstrated that Drosophila germline stem cells (GSCs), follicle stem cells (FSCs), and their progeny sense and respond to diet via complex mechanisms involving many systemic and local signals. AMP-activated protein kinase, or AMPK, is a highly conserved regulator of energy homeostasis known to be activated under low cellular energy conditions; however, its role in the ovarian response to diet has not been investigated. Here, we describe nutrient-dependent and -independent requirements for AMPK in Drosophila oogenesis. We found that AMPK is cell autonomously required for the slow down in GSC and follicle cell proliferation that occurs on a poor diet. Similarly, AMPK activity is necessary in the germline for the degeneration of vitellogenic stages in response to nutrient deprivation. In contrast, AMPK activity is not required within the germline to modulate its growth. Instead, AMPK acts in follicle cells to negatively regulate their growth and proliferation, thereby indirectly limiting the size of the underlying germline cyst within developing follicles. Paradoxically, AMPK is required for GSC maintenance in well-fed flies (when AMPK activity is presumably at its lowest), suggesting potentially important roles for basal AMPK activity in specific cell types. Finally, we identified a nutrient-independent, developmental role for AMPK in cyst encapsulation by follicle cells. These results uncover specific AMPK requirements in multiple cell types in the ovary and suggest that AMPK can function outside of its canonical nutrient-sensing role in specific developmental contexts.",2016,"Daniela Drummond-Barbosa, Kaitlin M Laws"

To identify relevant Drosophila RBPs organism-wide, we refined the RNA interactome capture method for comparative analysis of the pre- and post-MZT embryos. We determine 523 proteins as high-confidence RBPs, half of which were not previously reported to bind RNA.

Apontic regulates somatic stem cell numbers in Drosophila testes,26993259,10.1186/s12861-016-0103-3,"Background: Microenvironments called niches maintain resident stem cell populations by balancing self-renewal with differentiation, but the genetic regulation of this process is unclear. The niche of the Drosophila testis is well-characterized and genetically tractable, making it ideal for investigating the molecular regulation of stem cell biology. The JAK/STAT pathway, activated by signals from a niche component called the hub, maintains both germline and somatic stem cells. Results: This study investigated the molecular regulation of the JAK/STAT pathway in the stem cells of the Drosophila testis. We determined that the transcriptional regulator Apontic (Apt) acts in the somatic (cyst) stem cells (CySCs) to balance differentiation and maintenance. We found Apt functions as a negative feedback inhibitor of STAT activity, which enables cyst cell maturation. Simultaneous loss of the STAT regulators apt and Socs36E, or the Stat92E-targeting microRNA miR-279, expanded the somatic stem cell-like population. Conclusions: Genetic analysis revealed that a conserved genetic regulatory network limits JAK/STAT activity in the somatic stem cells of Drosophila testis. In these cells, we determined JAK/STAT signaling promotes apt expression. Then, Apt functions through Socs36E and miR-279 to attenuate pathway activation, which is required for timely CySC differentiation.

A novel role for the 3'-5' exoribonuclease Dis3L2 in controlling cell proliferation and tissue growth,27630034,10.1080/15476286.2016.1232238,"In a complex organism, cell proliferation and apoptosis need to be precisely controlled in order for tissues to develop correctly. Excessive cell proliferation can lead to diseases such as cancer. We have shown that the exoribonuclease Dis3L2 is required for the correct regulation of proliferation in a natural tissue within the model organism Drosophila melanogaster. Dis3L2 is a member of a highly conserved family of exoribonucleases that degrade RNA in a 3'-5' direction. We show that knockdown of dis3L2 in the Drosophila wing imaginal discs results in substantial wing overgrowth due to increased cellular proliferation rather than an increase in cell size. Imaginal discs are specified in the embryo before proliferating and differentiating to form the adult structures of the fly. Using RNA-seq we identified a small set of mRNAs that are sensitive to Dis3L2 activity. Of the mRNAs which increase in levels and are therefore potential targets of Dis3L2, we identified 2 that change at the post-transcriptional level but not at the transcriptional level, namely CG2678 (a transcription factor) and pyrexia (a TRP cation channel). We also demonstrate a compensatory effect between Dis3L2 and the 5'-3' exoribonuclease Pacman demonstrating that these 2 exoribonucleases function to regulate opposing pathways within the developing tissue.

[Dnmt2 is the Most Evolutionary Conserved and Enigmatic Cytosine DNA Methyltransferase in Eukaryotes],27281847,,"Dnmt2 is the most strongly conserved cytosine DNA methyltransferase in eukaryotes. It has been found in all organisms possessing methyltransferases of the Dnmt1 and Dnmt3 families, whereas in many others Dnmt2 is the sole cytosine DNA methyltransferase. The Dnmt2 molecule contains all conserved motifs of cytosine DNA methyltransferases. It forms 3D complexes with DNA very similar to those of bacterial DNA methyltransferases and performs cytosine methylation by a catalytic mechanism common to all cytosine DNA methyltransferases. Catalytic activity of the purified Dnmt2 with DNA substrates is very low and could hardly be detected in direct biochemical assays. Dnmt2 is the sole cytosine DNA methyltransferase in Drosophila and other dipteran insects. Its overexpression as a transgene leads to DNA hypermethylation in all sequence contexts and to an extended life span. On the contrary, a null-mutation of the Dnmt2 gene leads to a diminished life span, though no evident anomalies in development are observed. Dnmt2 is also the sole cytosine DNA methyltransferase in several protists. Similar to Drosophila these protists have a very low level of DNA methylation. Some limited genome compartments, such as transposable sequences, are probably the methylation targets in these organisms. Dnmt2 does not participate in genome methylation in mammals, but seems to be an RNA methyltransferase modifying the 38th cytosine residue in anticodon loop of certain tRNAs. This modification enhances stability of tRNAs, especially in stressful conditions. Dnmt2 is the only enzyme known to perform RNA methylation by a catalytic mechanism characteristic of DNA methyltransferases. The Dnmt2 activity has been shown in mice to be necessary for paramutation establishment, though the precise mechanisms of its participation in this form of epigenetic heredity are unknown. It seems likely, that either of the two Dnmt2 activities could become a predominant one during the evolution of different species.

We have therefore studied the mode of TFIIIB binding to DNA by site-specific protein-DNA photo-cross-linking. The results indicate that a portion of Brf1 is sandwiched between Bdp1 and TBP upstream of the TATA box. Furthermore, Bdp1 traverses the DNA under the N-terminal stirrup of TBP to interact with the DNA (and very likely Brf1) downstream of the TATA sequence.",2016,"Jin Joo Kang, William E Stumph, Yoon Soon Kang"
Silver nanoparticles disrupt germline stem cell maintenance in the Drosophila testis,26847594,10.1038/srep20632,"Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), one of the most popular nanomaterials, are commonly used in consumer products and biomedical devices, despite their potential toxicity.

The fruit fly Drosophila testis is an excellent in vivo model to elucidate the mechanisms underlying AgNP-induced defects in spermatogenesis, as germ lineages can be easily identified and imaged. In this study, we evaluated AgNP-mediated toxicity on spermatogenesis by feeding Drosophila with AgNPs at various concentrations. We first observed a dose-dependent uptake of AgNPs in vivo. Concomitantly, AgNP exposure caused a significant decrease in the viability and delay in the development of Drosophila in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, AgNP-treated male flies showed a reduction in fecundity, and the resulting testes contained a decreased number of germline stem cells (GSCs) compared to controls. Interestingly, testes exposed to AgNPs exhibited a dramatic increase in reactive oxygen species levels and showed precocious GSC differentiation. Taken together, our study suggests that AgNP exposure may increase ROS levels in the Drosophila testis, leading to a reduction of GSC number by promoting premature GSC differentiation.",2016,"Cynthia Ong, Xiaoli Liu, Lin-Yue Lanry Yung, Yu Cai, Gyeong-Hun Baeg, Qian Ying Lee, Jun Ding, Boon-Huat Bay"
The large X-effect on secondary sexual characters and the genetics of variation in sex comb tooth number in Drosophila subobscura,28116050,10.1002/ece3.2634,"Genetic studies of secondary sexual traits provide insights into whether and how selection drove their divergence among populations, and these studies often focus on the fraction of variation attributable to genes on the X-chromosome. However, such studies may sometimes misinterpret the amount of variation attributable to the X-chromosome if using only simple reciprocal F1 crosses, or they may presume sexual selection has affected the observed phenotypic variation. We examined the genetics of a secondary sexual trait, male sex comb size, in Drosophila subobscura. This species bears unusually large sex combs for its species group, and therefore, this trait may be a good candidate for having been affected by natural or sexual selection. We observed significant heritable variation in number of teeth of the distal sex comb across strains. While reciprocal F1 crosses seemed to implicate a disproportionate X-chromosome effect, further examination in the F2 progeny showed that transgressive autosomal effects inflated the estimate of variation associated with the X-chromosome in the F1. Instead, the X-chromosome appears to confer the smallest contribution of all major chromosomes to the observed phenotypic variation. Further, we failed to detect effects on copulation latency or duration associated with the observed phenotypic variation. Overall, this study presents an examination of the genetics underlying segregating phenotypic variation within species and illustrates two common pitfalls associated with some past studies of the genetic basis of secondary sexual traits.",2016,"Katharine L Korunes, Julianne B Hall, Brenda Manzano-Winkler, Briana E Mittleman, Mohamed A F Noor"
Extracellular Reactive Oxygen Species Drive Apoptosis-Induced Proliferation via Drosophila Macrophages,26898463,10.1016/j.cub.2015.12.064,"Apoptosis-induced proliferation (AiP) is a compensatory mechanism to maintain tissue size and morphology following unexpected cell loss during normal development, and may also be a contributing factor to cancer and drug resistance. In apoptotic cells, caspase-initiated signaling cascades lead to the downstream production of mitogenic factors and the proliferation of neighboring surviving cells. In epithelial cells of Drosophila imaginal discs, the Caspase-9 ortholog Dronc drives AiP via activation of Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK); however, the specific mechanisms of JNK activation remain unknown. Here we show that caspase-induced activation of JNK during AiP depends on an inflammatory response. This is mediated by extracellular reactive oxygen species (ROSs) generated by the NADPH oxidase Duox in epithelial disc cells. Extracellular ROSs activate Drosophila macrophages (hemocytes), which in turn trigger JNK activity in epithelial cells by signaling through the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) ortholog Eiger.

Skywalker-TBC1D24 has a lipid-binding pocket mutated in epilepsy and required for synaptic function,27669036,10.1038/nsmb.3297,"Mutations in TBC1D24 cause severe epilepsy and DOORS syndrome, but the molecular mechanisms underlying these pathologies are unresolved. We solved the crystal structure of the TBC domain of the Drosophila ortholog Skywalker, revealing an unanticipated cationic pocket conserved among TBC1D24 homologs. Cocrystallization and biochemistry showed that this pocket binds phosphoinositides phosphorylated at the 4 and 5 positions. The most prevalent patient mutations affect the phosphoinositide-binding pocket and inhibit lipid binding. Using in vivo photobleaching of Skywalker-GFP mutants, including pathogenic mutants, we showed that membrane binding via this pocket restricts Skywalker diffusion in presynaptic terminals. Additionally, the pathogenic mutations cause severe neurological defects in flies, including impaired synaptic-vesicle trafficking and seizures, and these defects are reversed by genetically increasing synaptic PI(4,5)P2 concentrations through synaptojanin mutations. Hence, we discovered that a TBC domain affected by clinical mutations directly binds phosphoinositides through a cationic pocket and that phosphoinositide binding is critical for presynaptic function.",2016,"Charlotte De Koninck, Patrik Verstreken, Valerie Uytterhoeven, Wim Versées, Jef Swerts, Kevin Lüthy, Ine Maes, Jone Paesmans, Sabine Kuenen, Baptiste Fischer"
Characterization of the Drosophila BEAF-32A and BEAF-32B Insulator Proteins,27622635,10.1371/journal.pone.0162906,"Data implicate the Drosophila 32 kDa Boundary Element-Associated Factors BEAF-32A and BEAF-32B in both chromatin domain insulator element function and promoter function. They might also function as an epigenetic memory by remaining bound to mitotic chromosomes. Both proteins are made from the same gene. They differ in their N-terminal 80 amino acids, which contain single DNA-binding BED fingers. The remaining 200 amino acids are identical in the two proteins. The structure and function of the middle region of 120 amino acids is unknown, while the C-terminal region of 80 amino acids has a putative leucine zipper and a BESS domain and mediates BEAF-BEAF interactions. Here we report a further characterization of BEAF. We show that the BESS domain alone is sufficient to mediate BEAF-BEAF interactions, although the presence of the putative leucine zipper on at least one protein strengthens the interactions. BEAF-32B is sufficient to rescue a null BEAF mutation in flies. Using mutant BEAF-32B rescue transgenes, we show that the middle region and the BESS domain are essential. In contrast, the last 40 amino acids of the middle region, which is poorly conserved among Drosophila species, is dispensable. Deleting the putative leucine zipper results in a hypomorphic mutant BEAF-32B protein. Finally, we document the dynamics of BEAF-32A-EGFP and BEAF-32B-mRFP during mitosis in embryos. A subpopulation of both proteins appears to remain on mitotic chromosomes and also on the mitotic spindle, while much of the fluorescence is dispersed during mitosis. Differences in the dynamics of the two proteins are observed in syncytial embryos, and both proteins show differences between syncytial and later embryos. This characterization of BEAF lays a foundation for future studies into molecular mechanisms of BEAF function.",2016,"Craig M Hart, S V Satya Prakash Avva"
"Transgenic Drosophila for Investigating DUX4 and FRG1, Two Genes Associated with Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy (FSHD)",26942723,10.1371/journal.pone.0150938,"Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is typically an adult onset dominant myopathy. Epigenetic changes in the chromosome 4q35 region linked to both forms of FSHD lead to a relaxation of repression and increased somatic expression of DUX4-fl (DUX4-full length), the pathogenic alternative splicing isoform of the DUX4 gene. DUX4-fl encodes a transcription factor expressed in healthy testis and pluripotent stem cells; however, in FSHD, increased levels of DUX4-fl in myogenic cells lead to aberrant regulation of target genes. DUX4-fl has proven difficult to study in vivo; thus, little is known about its normal and pathogenic roles. The endogenous expression of DUX4-fl in FSHD-derived human muscle and myogenic cells is extremely low, exogenous expression of DUX4-fl in somatic cells rapidly induces cytotoxicity, and, due in part to the lack of conservation beyond primate lineages, viable animal models based on DUX4-fl have been difficult to generate. By contrast, the FRG1 (FSHD region gene 1), which is linked to FSHD, is evolutionarily conserved from invertebrates to humans, and has been studied in several model organisms. FRG1 expression is critical for the development of musculature and vasculature, and overexpression of FRG1 produces a myopathic phenotype, yet the normal and pathological functions of FRG1 are not well understood. Interestingly, DUX4 and FRG1 were recently linked when the latter was identified as a direct transcriptional target of DUX4-FL. To better understand the pathways affected in FSHD by DUX4-fl and FRG1, we generated transgenic lines of Drosophila expressing either gene under control of the UAS/GAL4 binary system. Utilizing these lines, we generated screenable phenotypes recapitulating certain known consequences of DUX4-fl or FRG1 overexpression. These transgenic Drosophila lines provide resources to dissect the pathways affected by DUX4-fl or FRG1 in a genetically tractable organism and may provide insight into both muscle development and pathogenic mechanisms in FSHD.",2016,"Megan Parilla, Peter L Jones, Takako I Jones"
Halothane resistance in Drosophila melanogaster: development of a model and gene localization techniques,8659726,10.1097/00000539-199607000-00026,"Studying genetically altered animals that are resistant to inhaled anesthetics may ultimately lead to an understanding of anesthetics' mechanism(s) of action. We studied the genetics of halothane resistance in a strain of Drosophila melanogaster that showed substantially increased resistance to halothane anesthesia. We developed a test method that allowed us to repeatedly observe several samples of flies exposed to the same concentration of halothane, and we measured halothane resistance. The 50% effective dose (ED50) of 91R flies (our resistant population) was greater than the ED50 of Canton-S (our control strain) by 69% in females and by 48% in males. By assessing the contributions of the three major chromosomes of Drosophila to resistance, this study found that the X and third chromosomes of 91R have no effect on resistance, while the second chromosome has a major impact. Resistance within the second chromosome was further localized by testing marked recombinant chromosomes. The central region of 91R's second chromosome, bounded by the genes for black thoracic color and cinnabar eye color, determined most if not all of the increase in resistance. We were not able to further localize resistance within this segment of the second chromosome (containing about 8% of the total genetic map distance). An autosomal dominant gene for halothane resistance in 91R was localized to a small region of the second chromosome.",1996,"S Ramirez, M J Murray, D Dapkus"
Structure of the Y chromosomal Su(Ste) locus in Drosophila melanogaster and evidence for localized recombination among repeats,8770592,,"The structure of the Suppressor of Stellate [Su(Ste)] locus on the Drosophila melanogaster Y chromosome was examined by restriction analysis of both native and cloned genomic DNA. The locus consists of short subarrays of tandem repeats separated by members of other moderately repeated families. Both size variants and restriction variants proved to be common. Most repeats fell into two size classes-2.8 and 2.5 kb-but other size variants were also observed. Restriction variants showed a strong tendency to cluster, both at the gross level where some variants were present in only one of three subintervals of the locus, and at the fine level, where repeats from the same phage clone were significantly more similar than repeats from different clones. Restriction variants were shared freely among repeats of different size classes; however, size variants appeared to be randomly distributed among phage clones. These data indicate that recombination among tandem Su(Ste) repeats occurs at much higher frequencies between close neighbors than distant ones. In addition, they suggest that gene conversion rather than sister chromatid exchange may be the primary recombinational mechanism for spreading variation among repeats at the Su(Ste) locus.",1996,"B D McKee, M T Satter"

Changes in the expression of genes involved in protein synthesis during Drosophila aging,8796371,10.1159/000213783,"A characteristic feature of aging organisms is their loss in homeostatic functions, including the ability of protein synthesis and turnover. It has been proposed that in senescent Drosophila melanogaster the peptide synthesis elongation factor (EF) EF-1 alpha may become limiting and be responsible for the age-related decline in protein synthesis. We have determined the expression levels of EF genes in Drosophila and have compared them with the expression of several other genes involved in the protein synthesis pathway. Steady-state levels of mRNAs for EF-1 alpha F1 and F2, of mRNAs for four ribosomal proteins, of total poly A+ RNA, rRNA, and tRNA were measured. We show that most RNAs studied decrease immediately after eclosion. There is no evidence for EF-1 alpha mRNA becoming limiting in old flies. Our data suggest that down-regulation of RNA polymerase I-, II-, and III-mediated transcription may contribute to an age-related decrease in protein synthesis or other homeostatic functions.",1996,"C Brack, N Shikama"

A developmental differentiation was found between the Amy1-2 and Amy3-4 gene clusters, the former being preferentially expressed in larvae, the latter in adults. During adult life, we observed a decrease in Amy1-2 expression in males of certain strans. We have raised some arguments for the existence of trans-active regulators, acting as repressors of Amy1-2 in adults. The putative repressors might exhibit a geographical polymorphism, with a fixed active form in Pacific regions and a polymorphic pattern in Africa, thus increasing the diversity observed in adult amylase phenotypes. A clear differentiation between the two gene clusters was also found in tissue-specific activity along the third-instar larval midgut. In the anterior midgut, only Amy1-2 is active, while both gene groups are expressed in the posterior midgut, with an additional subzonation within it.",1996,"A Klarenberg, J L Da Lage, M L Cariou"
Rapid activation of calcium-sensitive Na+/H+ exchange induced by 20-hydroxyecdysone in salivary gland cells of Drosophila melanogaster,8822267,10.1016/0303-7207(95)03699-7,"Ecdysteroids play an important role in the larval moulting process of insects. 20-Hydroxyecdysone (20E) causes the induction of specific 'puffs' in polytene chromosomes of Drosophila melanogaster salivary gland cells. Although it is known that inorganic ions control pretranscriptional processes in the cell nucleus, the intracellular mechanisms of gene activation are still unclear. Therefore, we examined the effects of 20E on plasma membrane ion transport of Drosophila melanogaster salivary gland cells. Isolated glands of the third larval stage were superfused with a solution mimicking the haemolymph. The relative K+ conductance of the cell membrane (tK+) was measured with microelectrodes by performing ion substitution experiments. Under control conditions tK+ averaged to 0.16 + 0.02 (n = 15). Addition of 5 x 10(-6) M 20E increased tK+ within 2 min by 19.1 +/- 4.2% (n = 15). This rapid response to 20E was elicited only in the presence of calcium. Moreover, starting from a steady-state intracellular pH of 7.20-7.60, 20E induced a rise in cytoplasmic pH by 0.27 +/- 0.06 (n = 6) within minutes. Amiloride (10(-3) M), a blocker of plasma membrane Na+/H+ exchange, prevented the 20E-induced intracellular alkalinization. We conclude that 20E activates a calcium-sensitive plasma membrane Na+/H+ exchange leading to a rise of plasma membrane K+ conductance and intracellular alkalinization both being prerequisites for steroid hormone induced gene activation.",1996,"S Wünsch, S Schneider, A Schwab, H Oberleithner"
Molecular cloning and characterization of human cardiac homeobox gene CSX1,8888684,10.1161/01.res.79.5.920,"Accumulating evidence has suggested that homeo-domain-containing proteins play critical roles in regulating the tissue-specific gene expression essential for tissue differentiation and in determining the temporal and spatial patterns of development. In order to elucidate the mechanisms of human heart development, we have isolated a human homologue of the murine cardiac homeobox gene Csx (also called Nkx-2.5) and denoted it as CSX1. The amino acid sequence of the CSX1 homeodomain is 100% and 67% identical to that of murine Csx/Nkx-2.5 and Drosophila tinman, respectively. CSX1 has at least three isoforms generated by an alternative splicing mechanism. One of these isoforms (CSX1a) encodes a protein of approximately 35 kD that possesses the homeodomain, whereas the other two (CSX1b and CSX1c) encode a truncated protein of approximately 12 kD that is identical to the CSX1a protein at the amino-terminal 112 amino acids but lacks the homeodomain. Northern blot analysis showed that CSX1 transcripts are abundantly expressed in both fetal and adult hearts, but no signal was detected in other human tissues examined. Amplification of each isoform by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction revealed that all of the three isoforms are expressed in fetal and adult hearts and that the homeobox-containing isoform CSX1a is most abundant. The homeodomain-containing protein encoded by CSX1a binds to Csx/Nkx-2.5 binding sequences and transactivates the sequence-containing luciferase reporter gene. Unexpectedly, the homeodomain-lacking protein encoded by CSX1b also transactivates the reporter gene, although CSX1b does not bind to the Csx/Nkx-2.5 binding sequences. The highly conserved homeodomain sequence in evolution and the restricted expression in the heart suggest that CSX1 plays an important role in the development and differentiation of the human heart and that there may be two different mechanisms in transcriptional regulation by the CSX1 protein, homeodomain-dependent and -independent mechanisms.",1996,"T Yamazaki, T Mizuno, H Akazawa, R Aikawa, T Oka, I Komuro, I Shiojima, Y Yazaki"
"decapentaplegic, a target gene of the wingless signalling pathway in the Drosophila midgut",8631263,,"dishevelled, shaggy/zeste-white 3 and armadillo are required for transmission of the wingless signal in the Drosophila epidermis. We show that these genes act in the same epistatic order in the embryonic midgut to transmit the wingless signal. In addition to mediating transcriptional stimulation of the homeotic genes Ultrabithorax and labial, they are also required for transcriptional repression of labial by high wingless levels. Efficient labial expression thus only occurs within a window of intermediate wingless pathway activity. Finally, the shaggy/zeste-white 3 mutants revealed that wingless signalling can stimulate decapentaplegic transcription in the absence of Ultrabithorax, identifying decapentaplegic as a target gene of wingless. As decapentaplegic itself is required for wingless expression in the midgut, this represents a positive feed-back loop between two cell groups signalling to each other to stimulate each other's signal production.",1996,"S Hoppler, M Bienz, S Eresh, X Yu"

Strukturdifferenzierungen in Y-chromosom von Drosophila hydei: the unique morphology of the Y chromosomal lampbrush loops Threads results from 'coaxial shells' formed by different satellite-specific subregions within megabase-sized transcripts,8785614,10.1007/BF02259701,"The results of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis and two-colour transcript fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for the three Threads-specific DNA satellites YLII, YLI and rally are in support of long-range clustering of these sequence families within the subterminal region on the long arm of the Y chromosome of Drosophila hydei. On the basis of the linear arrangement of at least four extended clusters of satellite-specific sequences, the loop morphology of wild-type and several mutant Threads can be explained by assumption of a single Threads-specific transcription unit comprising about 5.1 Mb of repetitive DNA located between the Pseudonucleolus and the Nucleolus organizer. Transcription is unidirectional from the Pseudonucleolus towards the terminally located Nucleolus organizer. Transcripts most likely start in front of or within the 3.2 Mb region of YLII-related sequences, pass through subsequent blocks of 1.2 and 0.3 Mb of YLI- and rally-related sequences, respectively, and cease within the region of a smaller block of YLI-related repeats. The megabase-sized transcripts remain physically linked to the DNA axis and their extended satellite-specific regions form coaxial clouds or shells around the central DNA axis. In this way each cluster of earlier-transcribed sequences generates a cloud or shell on top of the later-transcribed ones. According to this model of 'satellite-specific coaxial shells' the tube-like morphology and other peculiarities of the Y chromosomal lampbrush loops Threads can be explained as a result of satellite-specific RNA superstructures and/or formation of extended ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes between clusters of satellite-specific transcripts and specific proteins. On the basis of this model the specific morphology of several Threads mutants can be interpreted as the result of large interstitial or terminal deletions that alter the total length of the Threads-specific transcription unit without exerting other major effects on principal features of the transcription process along the Threads.",1996,"P Trapitz, R Kurek, H Bünemann"
Cell internalization of the third helix of the Antennapedia homeodomain is receptor-independent,8663410,10.1074/jbc.271.30.18188,"We have recently reported that a 16-amino acid long polypeptide corresponding to the third helix of the DNA binding domain (homeodomain) of Antennapedia, a Drosophila transcription factor, is internalized by cells in culture (Derossi, D., Joliot, A. H., Chassaing, G., and Prochiantz, A.(1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 10444-10450). The capture of the homeodomain and of its third helix at temperatures below 10 degrees C raised the problem of the mechanism of internalization. The present demonstration, that a reverse helix and a helix composed of D-enantiomers still translocate across biological membranes at 4 and 37 degrees C strongly suggests that the third helix of the homeodomain is internalized by a receptor-independent mechanism. The finding that introducing 1 or 3 prolines in the structure does not hamper internalization also demonstrates that the alpha-helical structure is not necessary. The data presented are compatible with a translocation process based on the establishment of direct interactions with the membrane phospholipids. The third helix of the homeodomain has been used successfully to address biologically active substances to the cytoplasm and nucleus of cells in culture (Théodore, L., Derossi, D., Chassaing, G., Llirbat, B., Kubes, M., Jordan, P., Chneiweiss, H., Godement, P., and Prochiantz, A.(1995) J.

Patterning of the Drosophila embryo by a homeodomain-deleted Ftz polypeptide,8538765,10.1038/379162a0,"Homeodomain proteins regulate diverse developmental processes in a wide range of organisms, yet bind in vitro to DNA sequences that are remarkably similar. This has raised the fundamental question of how target gene specificity is achieved in vivo. The Drosophila fushi tarazu protein (Ftz) contains a homeodomain and is required for the formation of alternate segments. We have shown previously that a homeodomain-deleted Ftz polypeptide (Ftz delta HD), incapable of binding DNA in vitro, could regulate endogenous ftz gene expression. Here we test Ftz delta HD activities in a ftz mutant background and find that, surprisingly, Ftz delta HD can directly regulate ftz-dependent segmentation, suggesting that it can control target gene expression through interactions with other proteins. A likely candidate is the pair-rule protein Paired (Prd). Ftz delta HD bound directly to Prd in vitro and required Prd to repress wingless in vivo.

A cloned cDNA encoding MAP1 detects a single copy gene in mouse and a brain-abundant RNA whose level decreases during development,2423533,10.1083/jcb.102.6.2106,"Screening of a bacteriophage lambda gt11 cDNA expression library with a polyclonal anti-microtubule associated protein (MAP) antiserum resulted in the isolation of two non-cross-hybridizing sets of cDNA clones. One set was shown to encode MAP2 (Lewis, S. A., A. Villasante, P. Sherline, and N. J. Cowan, 1986, J. Cell Biol., 102:2098-2105). To determine the specificity of the second set, three non-overlapping fragments cloned from the same mRNA molecule via a series of ""walking"" experiments were separately subcloned into inducible plasmid expression vectors in the appropriate orientation and reading frame. Upon induction and analysis by immunoblotting, two of the fusion proteins synthesized were shown to be immunoreactive with an anti-MAP1-specific antibody, but not with an anti-MAP2-specific antibody. Since these MAP1-specific epitopes are encoded in non-overlapping cDNAs cloned from a single contiguous mRNA, these clones cannot encode polypeptides that contain adventitiously cross-reactive epitopes. Furthermore, these cDNA clones detected an abundant mRNA species of greater than 10 kb in mouse brain, consistent with the coding requirement of a 350,000-D polypeptide and the known abundance of MAP1 in that tissue. The MAP1-specific cDNA probes were used in blot transfer experiments with RNA prepared from brain, liver, kidney, stomach, spleen, and thymus. While detectable quantities of MAP1-specific mRNA were observed in these tissues, the level of MAP1 expression was approximately 500-fold lower than in brain. The levels of both MAP1-specific and MAP2-specific mRNAs decline in the postnatal developing brain; the level of MAP1-specific mRNA also increases slightly in rat PC12 cells upon exposure to nerve growth factor. These surprising results contrast sharply with reported dramatic developmental increases in the amount of MAP1 in brain and in nerve growth factor-induced PC12 cells. The cDNA clones encoding MAP1 detect a single copy sequence in mouse DNA, even under conditions of low stringency that would allow the detection of related but mismatched sequences. The cDNAs cross-hybridize with genomic sequences in rat, human, and chicken DNA, but not with DNA from frog, Drosophila, or sea urchin.

Differential responses of the dopa decarboxylase gene to 20-OH-ecdysone in Drosophila melanogaster,3007239,10.1016/0012-1606(86)90390-8,"The dopa decarboxylase gene (Ddc) of Drosophila melanogaster responds to 20-OH-ecdysone in the mature larval epidermis and in imaginal discs (presumptive adult epidermis) in a tissue-specific manner. Exposure of the mature larval epidermis to 20-OH-ecdysone caused a rapid accumulation of DDC transcripts. In the absence of protein synthesis, transcript accumulation was substantially reduced suggesting an indirect hormonal effect on DDC transcription (and/or RNA turnover). By contrast, neither DDC activity induction nor transcript accumulation was detected in imaginal discs cultured in the continuous presence of the hormone. However, when discs were exposed to 20-OH-ecdysone and then cultured in its absence, DDC activity and DDC transcript levels started to increase 6 hr after hormone withdrawal. A Northern analysis failed to reveal any novel transcripts in discs making the utilization of an alternative promotor an unlikely explanation for the very different responses of the Ddc gene in the two epidermal tissues.

Functional interactions of neurogenic genes of Drosophila melanogaster,17246418,,"The neurogenic genes of Drosophila melanogaster are involved in the decision of ectodermal cells to take on a neural or an epidermal fate.

Our analysis also included the Hairless locus, whose function is related to that of the neurogenic genes, as well as to many other genes. The effects observed were asymmetric in that triploidy for a given gene modified the phenotype of loss of the function of another gene, but triploidy of the latter gene did not modify the phenotype of loss of the function of the former gene. These asymmetries allowed us to establish a polarity of gene interactions, as well as to order the genes according to the assumed ability of some of them to modify the activity of others. In this sequence, almondex is the first link and Enhancer of split the last one. Our evidence suggests that the function of big brain is independent of the function of the other six.

In comparison with the mating test, the method of DNA hybridization is more direct and reliable. The origin and trends of distribution of P elements in China are discussed in this paper.",1988,"S Y Zhao, F Lai, J W Sun, Z D Liu, Z L Jiang"
"The C-terminal domain of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Drosophila melanogaster, and mammals: a conserved structure with an essential function",3122024,10.1128/mcb.8.1.321,"Using DNA encoding the largest subunit of Drosophila melanogaster RNA polymerase II, we isolated the homologous hamster RPO21 gene. Nucleotide sequencing of both the hamster and D. melanogaster RPO21 DNAs confirmed that the RPO21 polypeptides of these two species, like the Saccharomyces cerevisiae RPO21 polypeptide, contain both an N-terminal region homologous to the Escherichia coli RNA polymerase subunit beta' and a unique polymerase II-specific C-terminal domain. This C-terminal domain, encoded by separate exons in the D. melanogaster and hamster genes, consists of a tandemly repeated heptapeptide sequence. By constructing a series of deletions in DNA encoding the 26 heptapeptide repeats normally present in the S. cerevisiae RPO21 polypeptide, we have established that a minimum of between 9 and 11 repeats is necessary for RPO21 function in yeast cells. Replacement of the yeast RPO21 heptapeptide repeats by the longer hamster repetitive domain resulted in viable yeast cells with no detectable mutant phenotype, while a similar replacement of the yeast repeats by the more divergent D. melanogaster repeats was a recessive lethal mutation. We suggest that this novel repetitive domain is essential for proper initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II and that it may mediate the functions of TATA boxes, upstream activating sequences, and enhancers.",1988,"V D Fitzpatrick, C J Ingles, L A Allison, J K Wong, M Moyle"
Accurate and efficient pre-mRNA splicing in Drosophila cell-free extracts,3362856,10.1073/pnas.85.9.2904,"Synthetic mRNA precursors from the Drosophila fushi tarazu (ftz) gene were shown to be accurately and efficiently spliced in Drosophila nuclear extracts derived from Kc tissue culture cells or 0- to 12-hr embryos. Splicing the ftz pre-mRNA requires ATP and low levels of Mg2+. The reaction proceeds with a lag of 20-30 min prior to appearance of spliced mRNA and appears to proceed in two steps. The first step is cleavage at the 5' splice site to generate a 5' exon (E1) fragment and an intron-3' exon (IVS-E2) species. The second step involves cleavage at the 3' splice site, ligation of the two exons (E1-E2), and intron (IVS) release. The excised intron (IVS) and intron-3' exon (IVS-E2) exhibit anomalous electrophoretic mobility, suggesting that they contain branched structures. Nuclease analysis using two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography indicates that both the IVS and IVS-E2 species possess branched trinucleotides in which a guanosine residue at the 5' end of the intron is linked in a 2'-5' phosphodiester bond to the 2' hydroxyl group of an adenosine residue in the intron. The site of branchpoint formation was localized by debranching the Drosophila lariat with mammalian (HeLa) cell debranching enzyme and by P1 and T2 nuclease analysis. These findings indicate that nuclear extracts derived from Drosophila cultured cells or embryos can accurately splice mRNA precursors and that the reaction mechanism is the same as has been observed in yeast and mammalian cells. This system provides an initial step toward the biochemical analysis of developmentally regulated pre-mRNA splicing events in Drosophila.",1988,D C Rio
Transcriptomic and proteomic profiling of glial versus neuronal Dube3a overexpression reveals common molecular changes in gliopathic epilepsies,32344153,10.1016/j.nbd.2020.104879,"Epilepsy affects millions of individuals worldwide and many cases are pharmacoresistant. Duplication 15q syndrome (Dup15q) is a genetic disorder caused by duplications of the 15q11.2-q13.1 region. Phenotypes include a high rate of pharmacoresistant epilepsy. We developed a Dup15q model in Drosophila melanogaster that recapitulates seizures in Dup15q by over-expressing fly Dube3a or human UBE3A in glial cells, but not neurons, implicating glia in the Dup15q epilepsy phenotype. We compared Dube3a overexpression in glia (repo>Dube3a) versus neurons (elav>Dube3a) using transcriptomics and proteomics of whole fly head extracts. We identified 851 transcripts differentially regulated in repo>Dube3a, including an upregulation of glutathione S-transferase (GST) genes that occurred cell autonomously within glial cells. We reliably measured approximately 2,500 proteins by proteomics, most of which were also quantified at the transcript level. Combined transcriptomic and proteomic analysis revealed an enrichment of 21 synaptic transmission genes downregulated at the transcript and protein in repo>Dube3a indicating synaptic proteins change in a cell non-autonomous manner in repo>Dube3a flies. We identified 6 additional glia originating bang-sensitive seizure lines and found upregulation of GSTs in 4 out of these 6 lines. These data suggest GST upregulation is common among gliopathic seizures and may ultimately provide insight for treating epilepsy.",2020,"P Winston Miller, Daniel Johnson, Kevin A Hope, Lawrence T Reiter, David Kakhniashvili, Daniel Lopez-Ferrer"
The conserved microRNA miR-34 regulates synaptogenesis via coordination of distinct mechanisms in presynaptic and postsynaptic cells,32107390,10.1038/s41467-020-14761-8,"Micro(mi)RNA-based post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms have been broadly implicated in the assembly and modulation of synaptic connections required to shape neural circuits, however, relatively few specific miRNAs have been identified that control synapse formation. Using a conditional transgenic toolkit for competitive inhibition of miRNA function in Drosophila, we performed an unbiased screen for novel regulators of synapse morphogenesis at the larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ). From a set of ten new validated regulators of NMJ growth, we discovered that miR-34 mutants display synaptic phenotypes and cell type-specific functions suggesting distinct downstream mechanisms in the presynaptic and postsynaptic compartments. A search for conserved downstream targets for miR-34 identified the junctional receptor CNTNAP4/Neurexin-IV (Nrx-IV) and the membrane cytoskeletal effector Adducin/Hu-li tai shao (Hts) as proteins whose synaptic expression is restricted by miR-34. Manipulation of miR-34, Nrx-IV or Hts-M function in motor neurons or muscle supports a model where presynaptic miR-34 inhibits Nrx-IV to influence active zone formation, whereas, postsynaptic miR-34 inhibits Hts to regulate the initiation of bouton formation from presynaptic terminals.",2020,"Alicia Taylor, Chloe Warinner, Todd F DeLuca, Elizabeth M McNeill, Hansine Heggeness, David Van Vactor, Stephen Alkins, Tudor A Fulga, Leslie C Griffith, Dennis P Wall"
Change in geomagnetic field intensity alters migration-associated traits in a migratory insect,32343935,10.1098/rsbl.2019.0940,"Geomagnetic field (GMF) intensity can be used by some animals to determine their position during migration. However, its role, if any, in mediating other migration-related phenotypes remains largely unknown. Here, we simulated variation in GMF intensity between two locations along the migration route of a nocturnal insect migrant, the brown planthopper Nilaparvata lugens, that varied by approximately 5 µT in field intensity. After one generation of exposure, we tested for changes in key morphological, behavioural and physiological traits related to migratory performance, including wing dimorphism, flight capacity and positive phototaxis. Our results showed that all three morphological and behavioural phenotypes responded to a small difference in magnetic field intensity. Consistent magnetic responses in the expression of the phototaxis-related Drosophila-like cryptochrome 1 (Cry1) gene and levels of two primary energy substrates used during flight, triglyceride and trehalose, were also found. Our findings indicate changes in GMF intensity can alter the expression of phenotypes critical for insect migration and highlight the unique role of magnetoreception as a trait that may help migratory insects express potentially beneficial phenotypes in geographically variable environments.",2020,"Gao Hu, Fajun Chen, Chunxu Li, Jinglan He, Guijun Wan, Weidong Pan, Gregory A Sword, Ruiying Liu"
Microsporidia Can Acquire Lamin-like Intermediate Filaments and Cell Adhesion Catenin-cadherin Complexes from the Host (?),32498127,10.1111/jeu.12811,"On their spore surfaces, Microsporidia often develop a canopy of filaments with characteristics of intermediate filaments (IF), as we demonstrated in previous studies on Thelohania sp., Ameson michaelis, and Spraguea lophii. Genomic studies indicate that among invertebrates, lamins that may localize in the cytoplasm or nucleus, are the only known IF type. These IFs can bind to the substrate containing cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) cadherins, associated with β and γ catenins. The objects of this study were to determine whether microsporidia have CAMs with the attached IFs on their envelopes and to find out if these proteins are provided by the host. An examination was made for localization of lamins and CAMs on the spores of the mentioned above species and Anncaliia algerae, plus in the host animals. Then, we determined whether the spores of A. michaelis and A. algerae could bind vertebrate nuclear lamin onto the spore surface. We also tested transgenic Drosophila melanogaster stocks bearing cadherin-GFP to see whether developing A. algerae parasites in these hosts could acquire host CAMs. The tests were positive for all these experiments. We hypothesize that microsporidia are able to acquire host lamin IFs and cell adhesion catenin-cadherin complexes from the host.",2020,"Yuliya Y Sokolova, Earl Weidner, Robin M Overstreet"
Secondary Evolve and Resequencing: An Experimental Confirmation of Putative Selection Targets without Phenotyping,32159748,10.1093/gbe/evaa036,"Evolve and resequencing (E&R) studies investigate the genomic responses of adaptation during experimental evolution. Because replicate populations evolve in the same controlled environment, consistent responses to selection across replicates are frequently used to identify reliable candidate regions that underlie adaptation to a new environment. However, recent work demonstrated that selection signatures can be restricted to one or a few replicate(s) only. These selection signatures frequently have weak statistical support, and given the difficulties of functional validation, additional evidence is needed before considering them as candidates for functional analysis. Here, we introduce an experimental procedure to validate candidate loci with weak or replicate-specific selection signature(s). Crossing an evolved population from a primary E&R experiment to the ancestral founder population reduces the frequency of candidate alleles that have reached a high frequency. We hypothesize that genuine selection targets will experience a repeatable frequency increase after the mixing with the ancestral founders if they are exposed to the same environment (secondary E&R experiment). Using this approach, we successfully validate two overlapping selection targets, which showed a mutually exclusive selection signature in a primary E&R experiment of Drosophila simulans adapting to a novel temperature regime. We conclude that secondary E&R experiments provide a reliable confirmation of selection signatures that either are not replicated or show only a low statistical significance in a primary E&R experiment unless epistatic interactions predominate. Such experiments are particularly helpful to prioritize candidate loci for time-consuming functional follow-up investigations.",2020,"Claire Burny, Viola Nolte, Pierre Nouhaud, Christian Schlötterer, Marlies Dolezal"
"Structural analysis of the Drosophila rpA1 gene, a member of the eucaryotic 'A' type ribosomal protein family",3103101,10.1093/nar/15.3.987,"The expression of ribosomal protein (r-protein) genes is uniquely regulated at the translational level during early development of Drosophila. Here we report results of a detailed analysis of the r-protein rpA1 gene. A cloned DNA sequence coding for rpA1 has been identified by hybrid-selected translation and amino acid composition analysis. The rpA1 gene was localized to polytene chromosome band 53CD. The nucleotide sequence of the rpA1 gene and its cDNA have been determined. rpA1 is a single copy gene and sequence comparison between the gene and its cDNA indicates that this r-protein gene is intronless. Allelic restriction site polymorphisms outside of the gene were observed, while the coding sequence is well conserved between two Drosophila strains. The protein has unusual domains rich in Ala and charged residues. The rpA1 is homologous to the ""A"" family of eucaryotic acidic r-proteins which are known to play a key role in the initiation and elongation steps of protein synthesis.",1987,"S Qian, M A Kay, M Jacobs-Lorena, J Y Zhang"

It has been demonstrated that the presence of X chromosomes carrying this inversion, besides a marked increase in the severity of the maternal effect of the abo mutation, produces a zygotic effect resulting in the lethality of the progeny of stocks homozygous for abo and sc(4). These results indicate that the sc(4) inversion carries an abnormal region indispensable for the development of abo zygotes from sc(4);abo mothers.",1985,"G Lavorgna, T Labella, F Graziani, G Salzano, A Manzi, L De Ponti, C Malva"
RNA directed synthesis of catalytically active Drosophila sn-glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in Xenopus oocytes,2581943,,Xenopus laevis oocytes injected with poly(A)+ RNA isolated from Drosophila melanogaster direct the synthesis of catalytically active glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (NAD+) (EC 1.1.1.8). The de novo synthesized enzyme reflects the electrophoretic properties appropriate to the stock of flies from which the injected RNA was isolated and is electrophoretically distinct from endogenous Xenopus activity. Immunoprecipitation of 35S-labeled translation products has demonstrated two immunologically related proteins with molecular masses of 32- and 34kDa which are encoded by two separate mRNA molecules. The 32-kDa protein is identical in size and charge properties to the protein purified from the fly and possesses the catalytic activity observed in the Xenopus translational assay. Poly(A)+ RNA isolated from a strain of flies bearing a CRM- null mutation at the GPDH locus does not contain translatable RNA for the 32-kDa protein. These results suggest that the two immunologically related proteins are the translational products of two separate transcripts derived from either two related loci or from differential transcription and/or processing of the same genetic locus.,1985,"G C Bewley, J B Shaffer, D A Wright"
