"Notch signaling in intestinal homeostasis across species: the cases of Drosophila, Zebrafish and the mouse",21745469,10.1016/j.yexcr.2011.06.012,"Notch signaling has been recently shown to have a fundamental role in stem cell maintenance and control of proper homeostasis in the intestine of different species. Here, we briefly review the current literature on Notch signals in the intestine of Drosophila, Zebrafish and the mouse, and try to highlight conserved and divergent Notch functions across species. Notch signals show a remarkably conserved role in skewing cell fate choices in intestinal lineages throughout evolution. Genetic analysis demonstrates that loss of Notch signaling invariably leads to increased numbers of secretory cells and loss of enterocytes, while gain of Notch function will completely block secretory cell differentiation. Finally, we discuss the potential contribution of Notch signaling to the initiation of colorectal cancer by controlling the maintenance of the undifferentiated state of intestinal neoplastic cells and speculate on the therapeutic consequences of affecting cancer stem cells.",2011,"Allison Bardin, Silvia Fre, Sylvie Robine, Daniel Louvard"
Cullin-5 and cullin-2 play a role in the development of neuromuscular junction and the female germ line of Drosophila,21869472,10.1007/s12041-011-0062-1,"Cullins confer substrate specificity to E3-ligases which are multi-protein complexes involved in ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation or modification. There are six cullin genes in Drosophila melanogaster. We have raised an antibody against Cul-5 and demonstrated that it expresses in neuronal and non-neuronal cells throughout development. In the embryonic tracheal system, Cul-5 is enriched at fusion sites together with E-Cadherin and Fasciclin III. Mutations of cul-5 do not affect tracheal development but do show defects in the organization of synaptic boutons at the larval neuromuscular junction where the protein is expressed in a subset of motoneuron terminals. Loss of function of another cullin gene 'cul-2' results in similar defects at the larval neuromuscular junction although cul-2;cul-5 double mutants do not show an enhanced phenotype. Both cul-2 and cul-5 mutants show similar aberrations in the development of female germ line. Our results suggest that both of these cullin proteins participate in similar developmental processes.",2011,Champakali Ayyub
Basidiomycete Clitocybe nebularis is rich in lectins with insecticidal activities,21556921,10.1007/s00253-011-3236-0,"Basidiomycete mushrooms are a rich source of unique substances, including lectins, that could potentially be useful in biotechnology or biomedical applications. Lectins are a group of carbohydrate-binding proteins with diverse biological activities and functions. Here, we demonstrate the presence of a number of lectins in the basidiomycete mushroom Clitocybe nebularis. Glucose-, galactose-, sucrose-, lactose-, and Sepharose-binding lectins were isolated from fruiting bodies using affinity chromatography on Sepharose-immobilized sugars or on Sepharose. The lectins were characterized biochemically and their binding specificities examined by agglutination and agglutination inhibition assays. In addition, insecticidal and anti-nutritional properties of the lectins were studied against a model organism, fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster), and Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata). Of the several basidiomycete mushrooms screened, C. nebularis extract showed the most potent insecticidal activity. Sucrose-binding lectin showed the strongest activity against D. melanogaster, followed by lactose- and galactose-binding lectins. Feeding bioassays with Colorado potato beetle revealed that C. nebularis extract exhibited high anti-nutritional activity against the insect; and of those tested, only lactose-binding lectin, named CNL showed the effect. Mushroom C. nebularis is shown to be rich in a variety of lectins with versatile biological activities, including insecticidal and anti-nutritional effects. C. nebularis lectins could thus have potential for use as natural insecticides.",2011,"Andrej Cokl, Borut Strukelj, Jure Pohleven, Jerica Sabotič, Lara Vrabec, Jože Brzin, Adrijana Leonardi, Janko Kos"
SWI/SNF regulates the alternative processing of a specific subset of pre-mRNAs in Drosophila melanogaster,22047075,10.1186/1471-2199-12-46,"Background: The SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling factors have the ability to remodel nucleosomes and play essential roles in key developmental processes. SWI/SNF complexes contain one subunit with ATPase activity, which in Drosophila melanogaster is called Brahma (Brm). The regulatory activities of SWI/SNF have been attributed to its influence on chromatin structure and transcription regulation, but recent observations have revealed that the levels of Brm affect the relative abundances of transcripts that are formed by alternative splicing and/or polyadenylation of the same pre-mRNA. Results: We have investigated whether the function of Brm in pre-mRNA processing in Drosophila melanogaster is mediated by Brm alone or by the SWI/SNF complex. We have analyzed the effects of depleting individual SWI/SNF subunits on pre-mRNA processing throughout the genome, and we have identified a subset of transcripts that are affected by depletion of the SWI/SNF core subunits Brm, Snr1 or Mor. The fact that depletion of different subunits targets a subset of common transcripts suggests that the SWI/SNF complex is responsible for the effects observed on pre-mRNA processing when knocking down Brm. We have also depleted Brm in larvae and we have shown that the levels of SWI/SNF affect the pre-mRNA processing outcome in vivo. Conclusions: We have shown that SWI/SNF can modulate alternative pre-mRNA processing, not only in cultured cells but also in vivo. The effect is restricted to and specific for a subset of transcripts. Our results provide novel insights into the mechanisms by which SWI/SNF regulates transcript diversity and proteomic diversity in higher eukaryotes.",2011,"Zhi Wang, Ulrich Theopold, David Brodin, Neus Visa, Simei Yu, Ann Kristin Östlund Farrants, Anu Tyagi, Johan Waldholm"
Long tract of untranslated CAG repeats is deleterious in transgenic mice,21283659,10.1371/journal.pone.0016417,"The most frequent trinucleotide repeat found in human disorders is the CAG sequence. Expansion of CAG repeats is mostly found in coding regions and is thought to cause diseases through a protein mechanism. Recently, expanded CAG repeats were shown to induce toxicity at the RNA level in Drosophila and C. elegans. These findings raise the possibility that CAG repeats may trigger RNA-mediated pathogenesis in mammals. Here, we demonstrate that transgenic mice expressing EGFP transcripts with long CAG repeats in the 3' untranslated region develop pathogenic features. Expression of the transgene was directed to the muscle in order to compare the resulting phenotype to that caused by the CUG expansion, as occurs in myotonic dystrophy. Transgenic mice expressing 200, but not those expressing 0 or 23 CAG repeats, showed alterations in muscle morphology, histochemistry and electrophysiology, as well as abnormal behavioral phenotypes. Expression of the expanded CAG repeats in testes resulted in reduced fertility due to defective sperm motility. The production of EGFP protein was significantly reduced by the 200 CAG repeats, and no polyglutamine-containing product was detected, which argues against a protein mechanism. Moreover, nuclear RNA foci were detected for the long CAG repeats. These data support the notion that expanded CAG repeat RNA can cause deleterious effects in mammals. They also suggest the possible involvement of an RNA mechanism in human diseases with long CAG repeats.",2011,"Chui-Yen Li, Min-Jon Lin, Huichin Pan, Luen-Kui Chen, Li-Chun Wang, Kuang-Ming Hsiao, Ren-Jun Hsu"
Drosophila as a model of wound healing and tissue regeneration in vertebrates,21953647,10.1002/dvdy.22753,"Understanding the molecular basis of wound healing and regeneration in vertebrates is one of the main challenges in biology and medicine. This understanding will lead to medical advances allowing accelerated tissue repair after wounding, rebuilding new tissues/organs and restoring homeostasis. Drosophila has emerged as a valuable model for studying these processes because the genetic networks and cytoskeletal machinery involved in epithelial movements occurring during embryonic dorsal closure, larval imaginal disc fusion/regeneration, and epithelial repair are similar to those acting during wound healing and regeneration in vertebrates. Recent studies have also focused on the use of Drosophila adult stem cells to maintain tissue homeostasis. Here, we review how Drosophila has contributed to our understanding of these processes, primarily through live-imaging and genetic tools that are impractical in mammals. Furthermore, we highlight future research areas where this insect may provide novel insights and potential therapeutic strategies for wound healing and regeneration.",2011,"Nuria Paricio, Yaiza Belacortu"
Fluorescent fusion protein knockout mediated by anti-GFP nanobody,22157958,10.1038/nsmb.2180,"The use of genetic mutations to study protein functions in vivo is a central paradigm of modern biology. Recent advances in reverse genetics such as RNA interference and morpholinos are widely used to further apply this paradigm. Nevertheless, such systems act upstream of the proteic level, and protein depletion depends on the turnover rate of the existing target proteins. Here we present deGradFP, a genetically encoded method for direct and fast depletion of target green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusions in any eukaryotic genetic system. This method is universal because it relies on an evolutionarily highly conserved eukaryotic function, the ubiquitin pathway. It is traceable, because the GFP tag can be used to monitor the protein knockout. In many cases, it is a ready-to-use solution, as GFP protein-trap stock collections are being generated in Drosophila melanogaster and in Danio rerio.",2011,"Oguz Kanca, Emmanuel Caussinus, Markus Affolter"
"Inheritance of stress-induced, ATF-2-dependent epigenetic change",21703449,10.1016/j.cell.2011.05.029,"Atf1, the fission yeast homolog of activation transcription factor-2 (ATF-2), contributes to heterochromatin formation. However, the role of ATF-2 in chromatin assembly in higher organisms remains unknown. This study reveals that Drosophila ATF-2 (dATF-2) is required for heterochromatin assembly, whereas the stress-induced phosphorylation of dATF-2, via Mekk1-p38, disrupts heterochromatin. The dATF-2 protein colocalized with HP1, not only on heterochromatin but also at specific loci in euchromatin. Heat shock or osmotic stress induced phosphorylation of dATF-2 and resulted in its release from heterochromatin. This heterochromatic disruption was an epigenetic event that was transmitted to the next generation in a non-Mendelian fashion. When embryos were exposed to heat stress over multiple generations, the defective chromatin state was maintained over multiple successive generations, though it gradually returned to the normal state. The results suggest a mechanism by which the effects of stress are inherited epigenetically via the regulation of a tight chromatin structure.",2011,"Ki-Hyeon Seong, Dong Li, Shunsuke Ishii, Ryoichi Nakamura, Hideyuki Shimizu"
Phosphoinositide-3-kinase activation controls synaptogenesis and spinogenesis in hippocampal neurons,21414895,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4477-10.2011,"The possibility of changing the number of synapses may be an important asset in the treatment of neurological diseases. In this context, the synaptogenic role of the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) signaling cascade has been previously demonstrated in Drosophila. This study shows that treatment with a PI3K-activating transduction peptide is able to promote synaptogenesis and spinogenesis in primary cultures of rat hippocampal neurons, as well as in CA1 hippocampal neurons in vivo. In culture, the peptide increases synapse density independently of cell density, culture age, dendritic complexity, or synapse type. The induced synapses also increase neurotransmitter release from cultured neurons. The synaptogenic signaling pathway includes PI3K-Akt. Furthermore, the treatment is effective on adult neurons, where it induces spinogenesis and enhances the cognitive behavior of treated animals in a fear-conditioning assay. These findings demonstrate that functional synaptogenesis can be induced in mature mammalian brains through PI3K activation.",2011,"Alberto Ferrús, Xavier Gasull, Lilian Enriquez-Barreto, Carmen Sandi, Marta Cantarero, Miguel Morales, Germán Cuesto, Cristina Caramés, Ángel Acebes"
Criteria of validity for animal models of psychiatric disorders: focus on anxiety disorders and depression,22738250,10.1186/2045-5380-1-9,"Animal models of psychiatric disorders are usually discussed with regard to three criteria first elaborated by Willner; face, predictive and construct validity. Here, we draw the history of these concepts and then try to redraw and refine these criteria, using the framework of the diathesis model of depression that has been proposed by several authors. We thus propose a set of five major criteria (with sub-categories for some of them); homological validity (including species validity and strain validity), pathogenic validity (including ontopathogenic validity and triggering validity), mechanistic validity, face validity (including ethological and biomarker validity) and predictive validity (including induction and remission validity). Homological validity requires that an adequate species and strain be chosen: considering species validity, primates will be considered to have a higher score than drosophila, and considering strains, a high stress reactivity in a strain scores higher than a low stress reactivity in another strain. Pathological validity corresponds to the fact that, in order to shape pathological characteristics, the organism has been manipulated both during the developmental period (for example, maternal separation: ontopathogenic validity) and during adulthood (for example, stress: triggering validity). Mechanistic validity corresponds to the fact that the cognitive (for example, cognitive bias) or biological mechanisms (such as dysfunction of the hormonal stress axis regulation) underlying the disorder are identical in both humans and animals. Face validity corresponds to the observable behavioral (ethological validity) or biological (biomarker validity) outcomes: for example anhedonic behavior (ethological validity) or elevated corticosterone (biomarker validity). Finally, predictive validity corresponds to the identity of the relationship between the triggering factor and the outcome (induction validity) and between the effects of the treatments on the two organisms (remission validity). The relevance of this framework is then discussed regarding various animal models of depression.",2011,"Catherine Belzung, Maël Lemoine"
Synthesis of double-layered rotavirus-like particles using internal ribosome entry site vector system in stably-transformed Drosophila melanogaster,20820877,10.1007/s10529-010-0390-x,"We established a bicistronic expression system using an encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV)-derived internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) element to generate stably transformed Drosophila melanogaster Schneider 2 (S2) cells expressing human rotavirus Wa capsid proteins, VP2 and VP6, for the synthesis of VP2/6 double-layered virus-like particle (DVLP). The EMCV-derived IRES permitted bicistronic translation of recombinant VP6. Recombinant VP2 and VP6 were detected in extracellular fractions of stably transformed S2 cells. A wheel-like DVLP (diam ~ 50-55 nm) with short spikes was produced from the extracellular fraction of stably transformed S2 cells. A bicistronic expression system using an EMCV-derived IRES element can thus be used to express two proteins of interest in stably transformed S2 cells. The bi-or tri-cistronic expression of recombinant VP2/6/7 using stably transformed S2 cells can also be used to produce rotavirus VLPs.",2011,"Kyung Il Kim, Jong Min Lee, Ki Hyun Yoo, Jeon Hwang-Bo, In Sik Chung, Jong-Hwa Park, Ha Young Chung"
Social synchronization of circadian locomotor activity rhythm in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster,22031738,10.1242/jeb.057554,"Circadian clocks regulate the physiology and behaviour of organisms across a wide range of taxa. To keep track of local time, these clocks use a variety of time cues such as light-dark, temperature, food availability and social interaction cycles. This study assessed the role of social cues in modulating circadian clocks of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Using pair-wise interactions, we first estimated the percentage contribution of each interacting partner on the cumulative rhythmic behaviour of the pairs. Subsequently, we studied the effects of multi-individual (group-wise) interactions on the rhythmic behaviour of the group by estimating phase synchrony between individuals of different strains (having different circadian periods) maintained in both homogeneous and heterogeneous groups. Although it is known that social interactions improve synchrony between interacting individuals, we asked whether such interactions are able to synchronize the circadian rhythms of highly phase-desynchronized flies. We found that, although interactions between fly strains possessing different circadian periods failed to produce synchrony, social interactions among phase-desynchronized flies did enhance the phase synchrony of the interacting individuals. Differently phased individuals living in social groups displayed significantly greater phase synchrony than those living solitarily. Social synchronization is olfaction mediated as group-wise interactions among phase-desynchronized flies possessing compromised olfactory ability (Or83b(0)) did not improve phase synchrony. These results suggest that social cues synchronize the circadian clocks of Drosophila provided that the interacting individuals have similar clock periods.",2011,"Vijay Kumar Sharma, Shahnaz Rahman Lone"
The Enhancer of split complex arose prior to the diversification of schizophoran flies and is strongly conserved between Drosophila and stalk-eyed flies (Diopsidae),22151427,10.1186/1471-2148-11-354,"Background: In Drosophila, the Enhancer of split complex (E(spl)-C) comprises 11 bHLH and Bearded genes that function during Notch signaling to repress proneural identity in the developing peripheral nervous system. Comparison with other insects indicates that the basal state for Diptera is a single bHLH and Bearded homolog and that the expansion of the gene complex occurred in the lineage leading to Drosophila. However, comparative genomic data from other fly species that would elucidate the origin and sequence of gene duplication for the complex is lacking. Therefore, in order to examine the evolutionary history of the complex within Diptera, we reconstructed, using several fosmid clones, the entire E(spl)-complex in the stalk-eyed fly, Teleopsis dalmanni and collected additional homologs of E(spl)-C genes from searches of dipteran EST databases and the Glossina morsitans genome assembly. Results: Comparison of the Teleopsis E(spl)-C gene organization with Drosophila indicates complete conservation in gene number and orientation between the species except that T. dalmanni contains a duplicated copy of E(spl)m5 that is not present in Drosophila. Phylogenetic analysis of E(spl)-complex bHLH and Bearded genes for several dipteran species clearly demonstrates that all members of the complex were present prior to the diversification of schizophoran flies. Comparison of upstream regulatory elements and 3' UTR domains between the species also reveals strong conservation for many of the genes and identifies several novel characteristics of E(spl)-C regulatory evolution including the discovery of a previously unidentified, highly conserved SPS+A domain between E(spl)mγ and E(spl)mβ. Conclusion: Identifying the phylogenetic origin of E(spl)-C genes and their associated regulatory DNA is essential to understanding the functional significance of this well-studied gene complex. Results from this study provide numerous insights into the evolutionary history of the complex and will help refine the focus of studies examining the adaptive consequences of this gene expansion.",2011,"Jennifer V Kuehl, Richard H Baker, Gerald S Wilkinson"
Validation and application of Drosophila melanogaster as an in vivo model for the detection of double strand breaks by neutral Comet assay,21281740,10.1016/j.mrgentox.2011.01.010,"Comet assay under neutral conditions allows detection of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), which has consequence to genome instability and carcinogenesis. The present study aims to validate the neutral Comet assay for genotoxicity assessment in Drosophila melanogaster (Oregon R(+)) with three well known DSBs inducers i.e. cyclophosphamide (CP), bleomycin (BLM), cisplatin (CPT) and subsequently its efficacy in detecting DSBs in the organism exposed to a well known environmental chemical, chromium [Cr(VI)]. Third instar larvae of D. melanogaster were fed different concentrations of BLM, CPT and CP (50.0-200.0μg/ml) or Cr(VI) (5.0-20.0μg/ml) mixed standard Drosophila food for 48h. Neutral Comet assay was performed in cells of mid gut and brain from control and treated larvae. Our results show a dose-dependent increase in the migration of DNA in cells of the exposed organisms. A comparison among DNA lesions per mole number of the test chemical in the exposed groups showed that both BLM and CPT induce more DSBs than CP. Interestingly, Cr(VI) at 20.0μg/ml was found to induce significantly increased (p<0.001) DSBs in the exposed organism as compared to the control. The study while validating neutral Comet assay in D. melanogaster suggests its use for in vivo assessment of environmental chemical induced DSBs.",2011,"M Mishra, Anurag Sharma, A K Shukla, D Kar Chowdhuri"
Genome-wide analysis of the binding of the Hox protein Ultrabithorax and the Hox cofactor Homothorax in Drosophila,21483667,10.1371/journal.pone.0014778,"Hox genes encode a family of transcription factors that are key developmental regulators with a highly conserved role in specifying segmental diversity along the metazoan body axis. Although they have been shown to regulate a wide variety of downstream processes, direct transcriptional targets have been difficult to identify and this has been a major obstacle to our understanding of Hox gene function. We report the identification of genome-wide binding sites for the Hox protein Ultrabithorax (Ubx) using a YFP-tagged Drosophila protein-trap line together with chromatin immunoprecipitation and microarray analysis. We identify 1,147 genes bound by Ubx at high confidence in chromatin from the haltere imaginal disc, a prominent site of Ubx function where it specifies haltere versus wing development. The functional relevance of these genes is supported by their overlap with genes differentially expressed between wing and haltere imaginal discs. The Ubx-bound gene set is highly enriched in genes involved in developmental processes and contains both high-level regulators as well as genes involved in more basic cellular functions. Several signalling pathways are highly enriched in the Ubx target gene set and our analysis supports the view that Hox genes regulate many levels of developmental pathways and have targets distributed throughout the gene network. We also performed genome-wide analysis of the binding sites for the Hox cofactor Homothorax (Hth), revealing a striking similarity with the Ubx binding profile. We suggest that these binding profiles may be strongly influenced by chromatin accessibility and provide evidence of a link between Ubx/Hth binding and chromatin state at genes regulated by Polycomb silencing. Overall, we define a set of direct Ubx targets in the haltere imaginal disc and suggest that chromatin accessibility has important implications for Hox target selection and for transcription factor binding in general.",2011,"Steven Russell, Siew Woh Choo, Robert White"
"R2 dynamics in Triops cancriformis (Bosc, 1801) (Crustacea, Branchiopoda, Notostraca): turnover rate and 28S concerted evolution",20628416,10.1038/hdy.2010.86,"The R2 retrotransposon is here characterized in bisexual populations of the European crustacean Triops cancriformis. The isolated element matches well with the general aspects of the R2 family and it is highly differentiated from that of the congeneric North American Triops longicaudatus. The analysis of 5' truncations indicates that R2 dynamics in T. cancriformis populations show a high turnover rate as observed in Drosophila simulans. For the first time in the literature, though, individuals harboring truncation variants, but lacking the complete element, are found. Present results suggest that transposition-mediated deletion mechanisms, possibly involving genomic turnover processes acting on rDNAs, can dramatically decrease the copy number or even delete R2 from the ribosomal locus. The presence of R2 does not seem to impact on the nucleotide variation of inserted 28S rDNA with respect to the uninserted genes. On the other hand, a low level of polymorphism characterizes rDNA units because new 28S variants continuously spread across the ribosomal array. Again, the interplay between transposition-mediated deletion and molecular drive may explain this pattern.",2011,"A Luchetti, V Mingazzini, B Mantovani"
Survival in extreme environments - on the current knowledge of adaptations in tardigrades,21251237,10.1111/j.1748-1716.2011.02252.x,"Tardigrades are microscopic animals found worldwide in aquatic as well as terrestrial ecosystems. They belong to the invertebrate superclade Ecdysozoa, as do the two major invertebrate model organisms: Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster. We present a brief description of the tardigrades and highlight species that are currently used as models for physiological and molecular investigations. Tardigrades are uniquely adapted to a range of environmental extremes. Cryptobiosis, currently referred to as a reversible ametabolic state induced by e.g. desiccation, is common especially among limno-terrestrial species. It has been shown that the entry and exit of cryptobiosis may involve synthesis of bioprotectants in the form of selective carbohydrates and proteins as well as high levels of antioxidant enzymes and other free radical scavengers. However, at present a general scheme of mechanisms explaining this phenomenon is lacking. Importantly, recent research has shown that tardigrades even in their active states may be extremely tolerant to environmental stress, handling extreme levels of ionizing radiation, large fluctuation in external salinity and avoiding freezing by supercooling to below -20 °C, presumably relying on efficient DNA repair mechanisms and osmoregulation.

"The F box protein partner of paired regulates stability of Drosophila centromeric histone H3, CenH3(CID)",21871803,10.1016/j.cub.2011.07.041,"Centromere identity and function is determined by the specific localization of CenH3 (reviewed in [1-7]). Several mechanisms regulate centromeric CenH3 localization, including proteasome-mediated degradation that, both in budding yeast and Drosophila, regulates CenH3 levels and prevents promiscuous misincorporation throughout chromatin [8, 9]. CenH3(CENP-A) proteolysis has also been reported in senescent human cells [10] or upon infection with herpes simplex virus 1 [11]. Little is known, however, about the actual mechanisms that regulate CenH3 proteolysis. Recent work in budding yeast identified Psh1 as an E3-ubiquitin ligase that mediates degradation of CenH3(Cse4p) [12, 13], but E3-ligases regulating CenH3 stability in metazoans are unknown. Here, we report that the F box protein partner of paired (Ppa), which is a variable subunit of the main E3-ligase SCF [14-17], mediates CenH3(CID) stability in Drosophila. Our results show that Ppa depletion results in increased CenH3(CID) levels. Ppa physically interacts with CenH3(CID) through the CATD(CID) that, in the fly, mediates Ppa-dependent CenH3(CID) stability. Altogether, these results strongly suggest that, in Drosophila, SCF(Ppa) regulates CenH3(CID) proteolysis. Interestingly, most known SCF complexes are inactive when, at mitosis, de novo CenH3(CID) deposition takes place at centromeres, suggesting that, in Drosophila, CenH3(CID) deposition and proteolysis are synchronized events.",2011,"Mònica Torras-Llort, Olga Moreno-Moreno, Fernando Azorín, Sònia Medina-Giró"

"WAVE2, N-WASP, and Mena facilitate cell invasion via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent local accumulation of actin filaments",21769917,10.1002/jcb.23276,"Cell migration is accomplished by the formation of cellular protrusions such as lamellipodia and filopodia. These protrusions result from actin filament (F-actin) rearrangement at the cell cortex by WASP/WAVE family proteins and Drosophila enabled (Ena)/vasodilator-stimulated factor proteins. However, the role of each of these actin cytoskeletal regulatory proteins in the regulation of three-dimensional cell invasion remains to be clarified. We found that platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) induces invasion of MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells through invasion chamber membrane pores. This invasion was accompanied by intensive F-actin accumulation at the sites of cell infiltration. After PDGF stimulation, WAVE2, N-WASP, and a mammalian Ena (Mena) colocalized with F-actin at the sites of cell infiltration in a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent manner. Depletion of WAVE2, N-WASP, or Mena by RNA interference (RNAi) abrogated both cell invasion and intensive F-actin accumulation at the invasion site.

Separation of stem cell maintenance and transposon silencing functions of Piwi protein,22065765,10.1073/pnas.1106676108,"Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) and Piwi proteins have the evolutionarily conserved function of silencing of repetitive genetic elements in germ lines. The founder of the Piwi subfamily, Drosophila nuclear Piwi protein, was also shown to be required for the maintenance of germ-line stem cells (GSCs). Hence, null mutant piwi females exhibit two types of abnormalities, overexpression of transposons and severely underdeveloped ovaries. It remained unknown whether the failure of GSC maintenance is related to transposon derepression or if GSC self-renewal and piRNA silencing are two distinct functions of the Piwi protein. We have revealed a mutation, piwi(Nt), removing the nuclear localization signal of the Piwi protein. piwi(Nt) females retain the ability of GSC self-renewal and a near-normal number of egg chambers in the ovarioles but display a drastic transposable element derepression and nuclear accumulation of their transcripts in the germ line. piwi(Nt) mutants are sterile most likely because of the disturbance of piRNA-mediated transposon silencing. Analysis of chromatin modifications in the piwi(Nt) ovaries indicated that Piwi causes chromatin silencing only of certain types of transposons, whereas others are repressed in the nuclei without their chromatin modification. Thus, Piwi nuclear localization that is required for its silencing function is not essential for the maintenance of GSCs. We suggest that the Piwi function in GSC self-renewal is independent of transposon repression and is normally realized in the cytoplasm of GSC niche cells.",2011,"Mikhail S Klenov, Sergey A Lavrov, Anastasia D Stolyarenko, Vladimir A Gvozdev, Evgeny Y Yakushev, Elena A Mikhaleva, Olesya A Sokolova"
A brief history of trp: commentary and personal perspective,21286746,10.1007/s00424-011-0922-9,"The history of the discovery of the transient receptor potential (TRP) cation channel superfamily began in 1969 with Cosens and Manning's isolation of the Drosophila transient receptor potential mutant, in which the photoreceptor response decays during continuous illumination. Early studies from Minke found that the elementary light response was unaffected in trp mutants, and he attributed the defect to an intermediate stage of phototransduction. Montell and Rubin cloned the trp gene in 1989: they recognised it as a transmembrane protein, but also concluded that it did not encode the light-sensitive channels. In 1991, Minke and Selinger proposed that TRP represented a Ca2+ transporter required for refilling intracellular InsP3-sensitive Ca2+ stores, in turn required for activation of the light-sensitive channels. Also in 1991, after developing a photoreceptor patch clamp preparation, I showed that the light-sensitive channels themselves were highly permeable to Ca2+, questioning the need for such a dedicated Ca2+ transporter. In 1992, in collaboration with Minke, I resolved this paradox by showing there were two classes of light-sensitive channels, one highly Ca2+ permeable and eliminated in trp mutants. This represented the first and compelling evidence that TRP represented a light-sensitive channel and was supported by the cloning of the second light-sensitive channel, TRPL, by Kelly's lab. Three years later, in 1995, the labs of Montell and Birnbaumer independently cloned TRPC1, the first of 29 vertebrate TRP isoforms distributed amongst seven subfamilies.",2011,Roger C Hardie
Copy-number variation: the balance between gene dosage and expression in Drosophila melanogaster,21979154,10.1093/gbe/evr023,"Copy-number variants (CNVs) reshape gene structure, modulate gene expression, and contribute to significant phenotypic variation. Previous studies have revealed CNV patterns in natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster and suggested that selection and mutational bias shape genomic patterns of CNV. Although previous CNV studies focused on heterogeneous strains, here, we established a number of second-chromosome substitution lines to uncover CNV characteristics when homozygous. The percentage of genes harboring CNVs is higher than found in previous studies. More CNVs are detected in homozygous than heterozygous substitution strains, suggesting the comparative genomic hybridization arrays underestimate CNV owing to heterozygous masking. We incorporated previous gene expression data collected from some of the same substitution lines to investigate relationships between CNV gene dosage and expression. Most genes present in CNVs show no evidence of increased or diminished transcription, and the fraction of such dosage-insensitive CNVs is greater in heterozygotes. More than 70% of the dosage-sensitive CNVs are recessive with undetectable effects on transcription in heterozygotes. A deficiency of singletons in recessive dosage-sensitive CNVs supports the hypothesis that most CNVs are subject to negative selection. On the other hand, relaxed purifying selection might account for the higher number of protein-protein interactions in dosage-insensitive CNVs than in dosage-sensitive CNVs. Dosage-sensitive CNVs that are upregulated and downregulated coincide with copy-number increases and decreases. Our results help clarify the relation between CNV dosage and gene expression in the D. melanogaster genome.",2011,"Daniel L Hartl, Bernardo Lemos, Jun Zhou, Erik B Dopman"
"Insulators, not Polycomb response elements, are required for long-range interactions between Polycomb targets in Drosophila melanogaster",21135119,10.1128/MCB.00849-10,"The genomic binding sites of Polycomb group (PcG) complexes have been found to cluster, forming Polycomb ""bodies"" or foci in mammalian or fly nuclei. These associations are thought to be driven by interactions between PcG complexes and result in enhanced repression. Here, we show that a Polycomb response element (PRE) with strong PcG binding and repressive activity cannot mediate trans interactions. In the case of the two best-studied interacting PcG targets in Drosophila, the Mcp and the Fab-7 regulatory elements, we find that these associations are not dependent on or caused by the Polycomb response elements they contain. Using functional assays and physical colocalization by in vivo fluorescence imaging or chromosome conformation capture (3C) methods, we show that the interactions between remote copies of Mcp or Fab-7 elements are dependent on the insulator activities present in these elements and not on their PREs. We conclude that insulator binding proteins rather than PcG complexes are likely to be the major determinants of the long-range higher-order organization of PcG targets in the nucleus.",2011,"Hua-Bing Li, Pavel Georgiev, Vincenzo Pirrotta, Martin Müller, Katsuhito Ohno, Ilham Anne Bahechar, Olga Kyrchanova"
Porphyromonas gingivalis-host interactions in a Drosophila melanogaster model,21041486,10.1128/IAI.00785-10,"Porphyromonas gingivalis is a Gram-negative obligate anaerobe that has been implicated in the etiology of adult periodontitis. We recently introduced a Drosophila melanogaster killing model for examination of P. gingivalis-host interactions. In the current study, the Drosophila killing model was used to characterize the host response to P. gingivalis infection by identifying host components that play a role during infection. Drosophila immune response gene mutants were screened for altered susceptibility to killing by P. gingivalis. The Imd signaling pathway was shown to be important for the survival of Drosophila infected by nonencapsulated P. gingivalis strains but was dispensable for the survival of Drosophila infected by encapsulated P. gingivalis strains. The P. gingivalis capsule was shown to mediate resistance to killing by Drosophila antimicrobial peptides (Imd pathway-regulated cecropinA and drosocin) and human beta-defensin 3. Drosophila thiol-ester protein II (Tep II) and Tep IV and the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) homolog Eiger were also involved in the immune response against P. gingivalis infection, while the scavenger receptors Eater and Croquemort played no roles in the response to P. gingivalis infection. This study demonstrates that the Drosophila killing model is a useful high-throughput model for characterizing the host response to P. gingivalis infection and uncovering novel interactions between the bacterium and the host.",2011,"Melvin L Moeschberger, Christina O Igboin, Kevin P Tordoff, Ann L Griffen, Eugene J Leys"
Schistosoma haematobium: analysis of eggshell protein genes and their expression,2917627,10.1016/0014-4894(89)90004-0,"Eggshell protein genes of Schistosoma mansoni that encode a 14 kDa protein have been shown to be highly conserved and expressed in a sex-, tissue-, and temporal-specific manner. To initiate studies on the eggshell protein genes of S. haematobium, a cDNA probe, pSMf 61-46, representing a S. mansoni eggshell protein mRNA was used to screen a S. haematobium genomic library. Of the seven independent recombinant clones isolated, two (lambda SH 2-1 and lambda SH 6-1) were analyzed and compared to those of S. mansoni. lambda SH 2-1 and lambda SH 6-1 each contain a different genomic copy of the gene encoding a 19.8 and 17.6 kDa protein, respectively. This is due to an additional 78 bp present in the coding region of lambda SH 2-1 relative to lambda SH 6-1. The rest of the coding sequences are identical, and the 5' and 3' untranslated regions are nearly identical. The deduced amino acid sequences of S. haematobium eggshell proteins are very rich in glycine (47 and 50%) when compared to 43.5% glycine in the protein encoded by S. mansoni. Long stretches of glycines, as many as 15 in a row, occur in the S. haematobium sequence. DNA comparison of the eggshell protein genes of the two schistosome species yielded an overall homology of 83.1%. The homology is much higher in the 5' and 3' untranslated regions than in the protein-coding regions. Genomic clones of both species contained second open reading frames, which appeared to be kept open as a consequence of the amino acid composition of the other. There are no introns in S. haematobium or S. mansoni eggshell protein genes, and the genomic Southern data indicated a similar arrangement of these genes in the genome of both species. Primer extension experiments and dideoxynucleotide sequencing of the RNA determined the mRNA cap site sequence as ATCAT and ATCAC in lambda SH 2-1 and lambda SH 6-1, respectively. Northern blot analysis determined the size of the mRNA to be about 1.0 kp. Expression of the RNA from these genes appears to be regulated in a manner similar to the corresponding genes in S. mansoni. mRNA is found only in mature females and first appears at 70 days after infection of hamsters.

"Phenotypic and molecular analysis of the facets, a group of intronic mutations at the Notch locus of Drosophila melanogaster which affect postembryonic development",2548924,,"The function of the Notch locus of Drosophila melanogaster is essential for normal development both during embryogenesis and during postembryonic stages. In the embryo its function is necessary for the correct segregation of neural from epidermal lineages. During postembryonic stages Notch exhibits pleiotropic effects that are both tissue- and stage-specific. Here, we examine a group of six recessive mutations, the facets (fa, fa3, fag, fag-2, fafx and fasw), which affect eye morphology and have been previously shown to be associated with the insertion of transposable elements in an intronic region of Notch. The analysis of revertants has shown that the mutant phenotype depends on the presence of the transposable element and that the disruption of the wild-type sequence organization per se is not its cause. Four of these alleles, even though they are associated with the insertion of the same transposable element, display considerably different phenotypes. Therefore, no simple correlation exists between the mutant phenotype and the type of inserted element. A comparison of the tissue localization of the Notch and the transposable element transcripts revealed that in the third larval instar the elements are transcribed in both orientations in tissues in which Notch is also transcriptionally active. The complexity of the defects associated with the facet alleles, as well as the findings of the transcriptional analysis, indicate that a mutational mechanism based solely on transcriptional interference is not sufficient to explain the nature of the mutational event. It is likely that in these mutations alterations, in the temporal and/or spatial context caused by transcriptional and perhaps posttranscriptional interference mechanisms by the inserted elements, may be responsible for the mutant phenotype.",1989,"W J Welshons, K Markopoulou, S Artavanis-Tsakonas"
"Unusual behavior of the cytoplasmic transcript of hsr omega: an abundant, stress-inducible RNA that is translated but yields no detectable protein product",2500443,10.1083/jcb.108.6.2045,"Although a major site of transcription in heat shock, the Drosophila hsr omega gene does not encode any known heat shock proteins. Instead, studies of the hsr omega transcripts suggest that the RNA molecules, rather than encoded proteins, are the active products of this gene. The cytoplasmic RNA, omega 3, is spliced and polyadenylated and yet has only very small open reading frames (ORFs), and these are poorly conserved in different Drosophila species. Surprisingly, the work reported here leads us to conclude that one of the tiny ORFs in this RNA is translated. This ORF, designated ORF-omega, is notable in being the only ORF that shows sequence conservation in the three Drosophila species examined. However, translation of this ORF does not lead to detectable accumulation of the protein product. We suggest that ORF-omega may be an example of an unusual type of translated ORF. The act of translation itself may be important rather than the generation of a functional protein product. This nonproductive translation may play a role in regulation of cellular activities.",1989,"M L Pardue, M E Fini, W G Bendena"
[Development of resistance to the insecticide effect of juvenile hormone analog in Drosophila virilis: genetic and biochemical aspects],2625200,,"The development of resistance to the insecticide effect of juvenile hormone analogue (AJH-I) in Drosophila was studied. It is found that under the AJH-I treatment metamorphosis in D. virilis was delayed and some insects died. Selection of resistant flies was performed using sublethal dose of AJH-I (viability was 8%). The selection at such dose of AJH-I resulted in an increase in the proportion of resistant flies up to 30% already by the F3, whereafter is fluctuated within the range of 24-46% for further 12 generations. The increase in resistance to the lethal effect of AJH-I was also accompanied by an increase in resistance to its teratogenic effects. An analysis of the kinetics of selection has shown that the AJH-I resistance is controlled by more than one gene.

Long-range structural effects in supercoiled DNA: statistical thermodynamics reveals a correlation between calculated cooperative melting and contextual influence on cruciform extrusion,2752100,10.1002/bip.360280810,"We have previously described [K. M. Sullivan and D. M. J. Lilley (1986) Cell 47, 817-827] a set of sequences, called C-type inducing sequences, which cause cruciform extrusion by adjacent inverted repeats to occur by an abnormal kinetic pathway involving a large denatured region of DNA. In this paper we apply statistical thermodynamic DNA helix melting theory to these sequences. We find a marked correlation between the ability of sequences to confer C-type cruciform character experimentally and their calculated propensity to undergo cooperative melting, and no exceptions have been found. The correlations are both qualitative and quantitative. Thus the ColE1 flanking sequences behave as single melting units, while the DNA of the S-type plasmid pIRbke8 exhibits no propensity to melt in the region of the bke cruciform. The results of the calculations are also fully consistent with the following experimental observations: 1. the ability of the isolated colL and colR fragments of the ColE1 flanking sequences, as well as the short sequence col30, to confer C-type character; 2. C-type induction by an A + T rich Drosophila sequence; 3. low-temperature cruciform extrusion by an (AT)34 sequence; 4. the effect of changing sequences at a site 90 base pairs (bp) removed from the inverted repeat; 5. the effects of systematic deletion of the colL sequence; and 6. the effects of insertion of various sequences in between the colL sequence and the xke inverted repeat. These studies show that telestability effects on thermal denaturation as predicted from equilibrium helix melting theory of linear DNA molecules may explain all the features that are revealed by studying the extrusion of cruciforms in circular DNA molecules subjected to superhelical stress.",1989,"D M Lilley, F Schaeffer, E Yeramian"
Allozyme-associated heterosis in Drosophila melanogaster,2482224,,"Two large experiments designed to detect allozyme-associated heterosis for growth rate in Drosophila melanogaster were performed. Heterosis associated with allozyme genotypes may be explained either by functional overdominance at the allozyme loci, or closely linked loci; or by genotypic correlations between allozyme loci and loci at which deleterious recessive alleles segregate. Such genotypic correlations would be favored by consanguineous mating, small effective population size, population mixing and strong natural or artificial selection. D. melanogaster is outbred, has large effective population size and there is little evidence for genotypic disequilibria. Therefore it would be unlikely to show allozyme heterosis due to genotypic correlations. In the first experiment I estimated the genotypic values of 97 replicated genotypes. In the second experiment, 500 individuals were raised in a fluctuating, stressful environment. In neither experiment was there any consistent evidence for allozyme heterosis in size or development rate, fluctuating asymmetry for size or in tendency to deviate from the population mean. In the first experiment, heterosis explained less than 5.6% of the genetic variance in growth characters. In the second, heterosis explained less than 0.1% of the phenotypic variance in growth characters. Outside of the molluscs, species which show allozyme heterosis have population structures or histories which tend to promote genotypic correlations. There is little evidence that functional overdominance is responsible for observations of allozyme-associated heterosis.",1989,D Houle

The reaction was enhanced by a detergent and was sensitive to a DNA-A-free RNA-A indicating that the enzymatic activity was indeed associated with VLP which contain intrinsic RNA. The maximal incorporation of the labelled deoxynucleotide was observed at 25 degrees C in the presence of Mn2+.

Genetic analysis of the claret locus of Drosophila melanogaster,2513253,,"The claret (ca) locus of Drosophila melanogaster comprises two separately mutable domains, one responsible for eye color and one responsible for proper disjunction of chromosomes in meiosis and early cleavage divisions. Previously isolated alleles are of three types: (1) alleles of the claret (ca) type that affect eye color only, (2) alleles of the claret-nondisjunctional (cand) type that affect eye color and chromosome behavior, and (3) a meiotic mutation, non-claret disjunctional (ncd), that affects chromosome behavior only. In order to investigate the genetic structure of the claret locus, we have isolated 19 radiation-induced alleles of claret on the basis of the eye color phenotype. Two of these 19 new alleles are of the cand type, while 17 are of the ca type, demonstrating that the two domains do not often act as a single target for mutagenesis. This suggests that the two separately mutable functions are likely to be encoded by separate or overlapping genes rather than by a single gene. One of the new alleles of the cand type is a chromosome rearrangement with a breakpoint at the position of the claret locus. If this breakpoint is the cause of the mutant phenotype and there are no other mutations associated with the rearrangement, the two functions must be encoded by overlapping genes.",1989,"P Szauter, C R Nelson, W Sequeira"
Natural selection and ribosomal DNA in Drosophila,2556326,10.1139/g89-047,"Natural populations of Drosophila mercatorum are variable for the number of X-linked 28S ribosomal genes bearing a 5-kilobase insert. A separate polymorphic X-linked gene controls whether 28S repeats bearing the insert are preferentially underreplicated during the formation of polytene tissue. Female flies having at least a third of their 28S genes bearing the insert and lacking the ability to preferentially underreplicate inserted repeats display the abnormal abdomen syndrome. The syndrome is characterized by retention of juvenile abdominal cuticle into the adult, a slowdown in larval developmental time, and an increase in early female fecundity. The life history traits are expressed in nature and provide a basis for strong natural selection. The abnormal abdomen syndrome should be favored whenever the adult age structure is skewed towards young individuals, and field studies confirm this prediction. The closely related species, Drosophila hydei, also bears these inserts and appears to be subject to similar selection. However, D. mercatorum responds to this selection primarily through the allelic variation that controls preferential underreplication, whereas D. hydei responds primarily through adjustment of the proportion of inserted 28S genes. This is interpreted to mean that the evolution of a multigene family arises from the interaction of population-level and DNA-level processes.",1989,"H Hollocher, A R Templeton, S Lawler, J S Johnston"

Southern blot analysis showed that there may be more than one mvg gene in M. sexta. The putative transcriptional start point (tsp) for the cloned mvg was determined by primer extension analysis. This gene contains a single intron in the 5'-noncoding region. The 5'-flanking sequence was compared to the 5'-conserved regions of yolk polypeptide-encoding genes (yp) of Drosophila melanogaster.

Furthermore, the sequences flanking these two regions are also similar to the ecdysone-responsive elements found in several genes of D. melanogaster. In fact, preliminary experiments showed that mVg mRNA synthesis is induced by the 20-hydroxyecdysone. Four regions of the mvg gene resemble the upstream conserved regions of the two vitellogenin-encoding genes of the locust, Locusta migratoria.

Resistance to the insecticides lufenuron and propoxur in natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster (Diptera: Drosophilidae),9374593,10.1093/jee/90.5.1131,"Lufenuron is a newly marketed benzoylphenyl urea chitin-synthesis inhibitor insecticide that is effective against certain insects, including Drosophila melanogaster (Meigen). Resistance to this class of insecticides is not widespread in pest insect populations and, for the resistance that has been reported, the genetic basis is not understood. In previous work, natural population strains of D. melanogaster from 2 widely separated locations in the United States were found to be as much as 100 times more resistant to lufenuron when compared with laboratory strains. It was postulated that this resistance is the result of cross-resistance that evolved to an earlier, widely used insecticide. In the current study we examined cross-resistance of selected D. melanogaster strains to propoxur, a likely candidate carbamate insecticide that has been extensively used during the past 3 decades. However, no correlation between resistance to lufenuron and propoxur was found. Strains were selected to represent a range of dates of establishment (1936-1996) from natural populations to laboratory culture. Examination of these strains showed susceptibility to propoxur in long-established laboratory strains, but resistance in recently established strains. Susceptibility to lufenuron was also high in long-established strains and apparently slowly decreased in natural populations until approximately equal to 5 yr ago, when it decreased more rapidly. These results suggest that if this loss in susceptibility results from agricultural chemical usage, then these chemicals can significantly affect a non-target insect.",1997,"T G Wilson, J W Cain"
Nanos and pumilio establish embryonic polarity in Drosophila by promoting posterior deadenylation of hunchback mRNA,9247343,,"Nanos protein promotes abdominal structures in Drosophila embryos by repressing the translation of maternal hunchback mRNA in the posterior. To study the mechanism of nanos-mediated translational repression, we first examined the mechanism by which maternal hunchback mRNA is translationally activated. In the absence of nanos activity, the poly(A) tail of hunchback mRNA is elongated concomitant with its translation, suggesting that cytoplasmic polyadenylation directs activation. However, in the presence of nanos the length of the hunchback mRNA poly(A) tail is reduced. To determine if nanos activity represses translation by altering the polyadenylation state of hunchback mRNA, we injected various in vitro transcribed RNAs into Drosophila embryos and determined changes in polyadenylation. Nanos activity reduced the polyadenylation status of injected hunchback RNAs by accelerating their deadenylation. Pumilio activity, which is necessary to repress the translation of hunchback, is also needed to alter polyadenylation. An examination of translation indicates a strong correlation between poly(A) shortening and suppression of translation. These data indicate that nanos and pumilio determine posterior morphology by promoting the deadenylation of maternal hunchback mRNA, thereby repressing its translation.",1997,"J A Schisa, M E Lieberfarb, A C Verrotti, S Strickland, C Wreden"

In control mosaics, the absence of anterodorsal ectoderm was accompanied by a decrease in the size of epipharyngeal ganglion, whereas Notch mosaics, in contrast, showed the expansion of epipharyngeal ganglion over dorsal ectoderm up to the posterior end of the embryo. Differentiation abnormalities of cells of the ventral ectoderm in Notch mosaics were rarer.

The expression of a cloned Drosophila octopamine/tyramine receptor in Xenopus oocytes,9374200,10.1016/s0006-8993(97)00723-3,"The expression of a cloned Drosophila octopamine/tyramine receptor (OctyR99AB) is described in Xenopus oocytes. Agonist stimulation of OctyR99AB receptors increased intracellular Ca2+ levels monitored as changes in the endogenous inward Ca2+-dependent chloride current. The receptor is preferentially sensitive to biogenic amines with a single hydroxyl on the aromatic ring. The G-protein, Galphai, appears to be involved in the coupling of the receptor to the production of intracellular calcium signals, since the effect is pertussis-toxin sensitive and is blocked or substantially reduced in antisense knockout experiments using oligonucleotides directed against Galphai but not by those directed against Galphao, Galphaq and Galpha11. The increase in intracellular calcium levels induced by activation of the OctyR99AB receptor can potentiate the ability of activation of a co-expressed beta2-adrenergic receptor to increase oocyte cyclic AMP levels. A comparison of the pharmacological coupling of OctyR99AB to different second messenger systems when expressed in Xenopus oocytes with previous studies on the expression of the receptor in a Chinese hamster ovary cell line suggests that the property of agonist-specific coupling of the receptor to different second messenger systems may be cell-specific, depending upon the G-protein environment of any particular cell type.",1997,"J M Midgley, F Hannan, V Reale, P D Evans"
Calmodulin regulation of calcium stores in phototransduction of Drosophila,9027311,10.1126/science.275.5303.1119,"Phototransduction in Drosophila occurs through the ubiquitous phosphoinositide-mediated signal transduction system. Major unresolved questions in this pathway are the identity and role of the internal calcium stores in light excitation and the mechanism underlying regulation of Ca2+ release from internal stores. Treatment of Drosophila photoreceptors with ryanodine and caffeine disrupted the current induced by light, whereas subsequent application of calcium-calmodulin (Ca-CaM) rescued the inactivated photoresponse. In calcium-deprived wild-type Drosophila and in calmodulin-deficient transgenic flies, the current induced by light was disrupted by a specific inhibitor of Ca-CaM. Furthermore, inhibition of Ca-CaM revealed light-induced release of calcium from intracellular stores. It appears that functional ryanodine-sensitive stores are essential for the photoresponse. Moreover, calcium release from these stores appears to be a component of Drosophila phototransduction, and Ca-CaM regulates this process.",1997,"B Cook, B Minke, A Arnon, C Montell, Z Selinger"
Germ line transposition of the copia retrotransposon in Drosophila melanogaster is restricted to males by tissue-specific control of copia RNA levels,9230904,10.1007/s004380050479,"Germ line transposition rates of the retrotransposon copia were directly measured in males and females of an inbred Drosophila melanogaster line, 2b3, which is highly polymorphic for copia insertion sites. The elevated germ line transposition rate of copia in this line (3-8 x 10(-3) per generation per element) is confined to males, with transposition in females being undetectable under the conditions of the experiment but at most 50-fold lower than the rate for males. To determine the molecular basis of this effect, copia RNA levels were measured in whole bodies and germ lines of male and female flies of both the unstable 2b3 line and a stable line, Oregon RC-iso, which shows normal rates of copia transposition. Both male and female 2b3 flies contain much more copia RNA than flies of the stable line. However, 2b3 male germinal tissues contain much higher levels of copia RNA than the equivalent female tissues. The highest copia expression is detected in maturing primary spermatocytes. Our data show that high rates of germ line copia transposition are restricted to males by tissue-specific control of RNA levels and suggest that transposition of copia only occurs in fly tissues containing more than a relatively high threshold level of copia RNA.",1997,"W Li, A J Flavell, S Nuzhdin, E Pasyukova"
A role for the Wnt gene family in hematopoiesis: expansion of multilineage progenitor cells,9160667,,"The microenvironment is a key regulator of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and is a likely source of extracellular factors that control stem cell fate. A better understanding of these microenvironmental factors may come from investigations of developmental cell fate determination in which the critical roles of cell-cell interactions of multipotential cells have been shown. The Wnt gene family is known to regulate the cell fate and cell-cell interactions of multipotential cells in a variety of tissues. Expression of Wnts and of their putative receptors encoded by murine homologs of the Drosophila frizzled gene in hematopoietic tissues was examined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Wnt-5a and Wnt-10b were expressed in day-11 murine yolk sac, day-14 fetal liver, and fetal liver AA4+ cells. The expression profiles of four murine frizzled homologs, Mfz3-7, were nearly identical to that of Wnt-5a and Wnt-10b. Notably, Wnt-10b was expressed in the fetal liver AA4+ Sca+ c-kit+ flASK) HSC population. A role for Wnts in HSC fate determination was studied by treatment of HSC populations in culture with soluble WNT proteins. The addition of conditioned media from cells transfected with Wnt-1, Wnt-5a, or Wnt-10b cDNAs to cultures of flASK cells stimulated a sevenfold, eightfold, and 11-fold expansion in cell number, respectively, relative to control media. Removal of WNT-5a from this media by immunodepletion depleted the stimulatory activity from the media, whereas addition of a partially purified WNT-5a stimulated a fivefold expansion relative to control cells. Transduction of flASK cells with a retrovirus bearing a Wnt-5a cDNA enhanced proliferation. We conclude that WNTs stimulate the survival/proliferation of hematopoietic progenitors, demonstrating that WNTs comprise a novel class of hematopoietic cell regulators.",1997,"W Matthews, G P Solar, L Liem, F C Ziegler, T W Austin"
CNS midline cells in Drosophila induce the differentiation of lateral neural cells,9362458,,"Cells located at the midline of the developing central nervous system perform a number of conserved functions during the establishment of the lateral CNS. The midline cells of the Drosophila CNS were previously shown to be required for correct pattern formation in the ventral ectoderm and for the induction of specific mesodermal cells. Here we investigated whether the midline cells are required for the correct development of lateral CNS cells as well. Embryos that lack midline cells through genetic ablation show a 15% reduction in the number of cortical CNS cells. A similar thinning of the ventral nerve cord can be observed following mechanical ablation of the midline cells. We have identified a number of specific neuronal and glial cell markers that are reduced in CNS midline-less embryos (in single-minded embryos, in early heat-shocked Notch(ts1) embryos or in embryos where we mechanically ablated the midline cells). Genetic data suggest that both neuronal and glial midline cell lineages are required for differentiation of lateral CNS cells. We could rescue the lateral CNS phenotype of single-minded mutant embryos by transplantation of midline cells as well as by homotopic expression of single-minded, the master gene for midline development. Furthermore, ectopic midline cells are able to induce enhanced expression of some lateral CNS cell markers. We thus conclude that the CNS midline plays an important role in the differentiation or maintenance of the lateral CNS cortex.",1997,"K Lüer, G M Technau, C Klämbt, T V Menne"
Mash1 activates a cascade of bHLH regulators in olfactory neuron progenitors,9108377,,"The lineage of olfactory neurons has been relatively well characterized at the cellular level, but the genes that regulate the proliferation and differentiation of their progenitors are currently unknown. In this study, we report the isolation of a novel murine gene, Math4C/neurogenin1, which is distantly related to the Drosophila proneural gene atonal. We show that Math4C/neurogenin1 and the basic helix-loop-helix gene Mash1 are expressed in the olfactory epithelium by different dividing progenitor populations, while another basic helix-loop-helix gene, NeuroD, is expressed at the onset of neuronal differentiation. These expression patterns suggest that each gene marks a distinct stage of olfactory neuron progenitor development, in the following sequence: Mash1>Math4C/neurogenin1>NeuroD. We have previously reported that inactivation of Mash1 function leads to a severe reduction in the number of olfactory neurons. We show here that most cells in the olfactory epithelium of Mash1 mutant embryos fail to express Math4C/neurogenin1 or NeuroD. Strikingly, a subset of progenitor cells in a ventrocaudal domain of Mash1 mutant olfactory epithelium still express Math4C/neurogenin1 and NeuroD and differentiate into neurons. Cells in this domain also express Math4A/neurogenin2, another member of the Math4/neurogenin gene family, and not Mash1. Our results demonstrate that Mash1 is required at an early stage in the olfactory neuron lineage to initiate a differentiation program involving Math4C/neurogenin1 and NeuroD. Another gene activates a similar program in a separate population of olfactory neuron progenitors.",1997,"G Gradwohl, E Cau, C Fode, F Guillemot"
Scrambler and yotari disrupt the disabled gene and produce a reeler-like phenotype in mice,9338784,10.1038/39601,"Formation of the mammalian brain requires choreographed migration of neurons to generate highly ordered laminar structures such as those in the cortices of the forebrain and the cerebellum. These processes are severely disrupted by mutations in reelin which cause widespread misplacement of neurons and associated ataxia in reeler mice. Reelin is a large extracellular protein secreted by pioneer neurons that coordinates cell positioning during neurodevelopment. Two new autosomal recessive mouse mutations, scramble and yotari have been described that exhibit a phenotype identical to reeler. Here we report that scrambler and yotari arise from mutations in mdab1, a mouse gene related to the Drosophila gene disabled (dab). Both scrambler and yotari mice express mutated forms of mdab1 messenger RNA and little or no mDab1 protein. mDab1 is a phosphoprotein that appears to function as an intracellular adaptor in protein kinase pathways. Expression analysis indicates that mdab1 is expressed in neuronal populations exposed to Reelin. The similar phenotypes of reeler, scrambler, yotari and mdab1 null mice indicate that Reelin and mDab1 function as signalling molecules that regulate cell positioning in the developing brain.",1997,"D Goldowitz, J A Cooper, D S Rice, M Sheldon, G D'Arcangelo, K Mikoshiba, B W Howell, K Nakajima, T Curran, H Yoneshima"
Use of stress-inducible transgenic nematodes as biomarkers of heavy metal pollution in water samples from an english river system,9069189,10.1007/s002449900167,"Transgenic strains of the nematode Caenorhabditiselegans, which carry stress-inducible lacZ reporter genes, aremeasurably stressed by exposure to heavy metals in aqueous solution. Thisstress response can be quantified, using enzymatic assays for the reportergene-product (Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase), or estimatedapproximately by in situ staining for beta-galactosidase in exposedworms. Stress responses to heavy metals have been demonstrated both inlaboratory tests using Cd2+ or Hg2+, and also in watersamples taken from a metal-polluted river system in southwest England. TheRiver Carnon flows through an area with an ancient mining history,principally for Sn, but also for Cu and other metals; As, Cd, Al, Mn, and Zn,as well as large amounts of Fe, are all present in these ore bodies. Foursites in the Carnon river basin were compared with respect to theirmacroinvertebrate diversity, physical and chemical characteristics (includingthe concentrations of As, Cd, Al, Cu, Mn, Zn, and Fe). Transgenic worms wereexposed to water samples from these four sites, and also to a 0.33%(v/v) dilution of metal-laden minewater from the principal local mine (WhealJane). Transgene expression was induced in all five cases, though markedlyless so for the least polluted of the sites (which also supported a richermacroinvertebrate fauna). Two different transgenic strains were tested inthis study; strain PC72 (using a homologous hsp16 promoter) isslightly more sensitive to most metal-containing water samples than strainCB4027 (using a heterologous Drosophila hsp70 promoter). Bothtransgenic strains and two different assay methods gave essentially similarresults. These findings demonstrate that transgenic nematodes could provide arapid and simple assessment of aquatic pollution, in that the transgeneresponse is inducible by mixtures of dissolved metals at concentrationsactually encountered in metal-polluted watercourses.",1997,"Candido EPM, M H Mutwakil, D M Holdich, D I de Pomerai, E G Stringham, P R Smithurst, D Jones, J P Reader"
Infection of the germ line by retroviral particles produced in the follicle cells: a possible mechanism for the mobilization of the gypsy retroelement of Drosophila,9226450,,"The gypsy retroelement of Drosophila moves at high frequency in the germ line of the progeny of females carrying a mutation in the flamenco (flam) gene. This high rate of de novo insertion correlates with elevated accumulation of full-length gypsy RNA in the ovaries of these females, as well as the presence of an env-specific RNA. We have prepared monoclonal antibodies against the gypsy Pol and Env products and found that these proteins are expressed in the ovaries of flam females and processed in the manner characteristic of vertebrate retroviruses. The Pol proteins are expressed in both follicle and nurse cells, but they do not accumulate at detectable levels in the oocyte. The Env proteins are expressed exclusively in the follicle cells starting at stage 9 of oogenesis, where they accumulate in the secretory apparatus of the endoplasmic reticulum. They then migrate to the inner side of the cytoplasmic membrane where they assemble into viral particles. These particles can be observed in the perivitelline space starting at stage 10 by immunoelectron microscopy using anti-Env antibodies. We propose a model to explain flamenco-mediated induction of gypsy mobilization that involves the synthesis of gypsy viral particles in the follicle cells, from where they leave and infect the oocyte, thus explaining gypsy insertion into the germ line of the subsequent generation.",1997,"V G Corces, J D Boeke, S U Song, M Kurkulos"
Hypergravity and aging in Drosophila melanogaster. 9. Conditioned suppression and habituation of the proboscis extension response,9359939,,"In a first experiment, the conditioned suppression of the proboscis extension response (PER) to sucrose was measured in young, middle-aged and old male Drosophila melanogaster flies living at either 1, 3 or 5 g. Flies were starved and then subjected to a learning task involving a sucrose stimulus, followed by an aversive one applied to their forelegs. In this learning task, flies learn to not extend their proboscis when walking on sucrose. Flies which have lived in hypergravity (HG) had a lower number of PER suppressions than 1 g ones, and this finding was mainly due to young and middle-aged flies. In a second experiment, the habituation of the PER was studied using as stimulation sucrose solutions 2-fold (first experiment), 4-fold (second one) or 8-fold (third one) higher than the individual sucrose threshold. Middle-aged and old flies habituated more slowly than young flies in the second and third experiments. In the third experiment, a decreasing speed of habituation was observed when gravity increased; this result was mainly due to young flies, and no gravity effect was observed in the other two age groups. This whole set of results suggests that HG-kept flies do not age faster than 1 g ones, as far as these learning and habituation tasks are concerned. It seems possible that HG acts like a mild stress to which flies adapt; if applied for a long time, HG could induce a premature aging, as observed in the previous papers of this series.",1997,"E Le Bourg, N Minois"
Abnormal skeletal patterning in embryos lacking a single Cbp allele: a partial similarity with Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome,9294190,10.1073/pnas.94.19.10215,"CBP is a transcriptional coactivator required by many transcription factors for transactivation. Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, which is an autosomal dominant syndrome characterized by abnormal pattern formation, has been shown to be associated with mutations in the Cbp gene. Furthermore, Drosophila CBP is required in hedgehog signaling for the expression of decapentapleigic, the Drosophila homologue of bone morphogenetic protein. However, no direct evidence exists to indicate that loss of one copy of the mammalian Cbp gene affects pattern formation. Here, we show that various abnormalities occur at high frequency in the skeletal system of heterozygous Cbp-deficient mice resulting from a C57BL/6-CBA x BALB/c cross. In support of a conserved signaling pathway for pattern formation in insects and mammals, the expression of Bmp7 was found to be reduced in the heterozygous mutants. The frequency of the different abnormalities was significantly lower in a C57BL/6-CBA background, suggesting that the genetic background is an important determinant of the variability and severity of the anomalies seen in Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome patients.",1997,"I Naruse, T Maekawa, Y Tanaka, S Ishii, H Masuya, T Shiroishi"
The homeobox gene Distal-less induces ventral appendage development in Drosophila,9303541,10.1101/gad.11.17.2259,"This study investigates the role of the homeobox gene Distal-less (Dll) in the development of the legs, antennae, and wings of Drosophila. Lack of Dll function causes a change in the identity of ventral appendage cells (legs and antennae) that often results in the loss of the appendage. Ectopic Dll expression in the proximal region of ventral appendages induces nonautonomous duplication of legs and antennae by the activation of wingless and decapentaplegic. Ectopic Dll expression in dorsal appendages produces transformation into corresponding ventral appendages; wings and halteres develop ectopic legs and the head-eye region develops ectopic antennae. In the wing, the exogenous Dll product induces this transformation by activating the endogenous Dll gene and repressing the wing determinant gene vestigial. It is proposed that Dll induces the development of ventral appendages and also participates in a genetic address that specifies the identity of ventral appendages and discriminates the dorsal versus the ventral appendages in the adult. However, unlike other homeotic genes, Dll expression and function is not defined by a cell lineage border. Dll also performs a secondary and late function required for the normal patterning of the wing.",1997,"I Guerrero, N Gorfinkiel, G Morata"
Establishement of the dorso-ventral pattern during embryonic development of drosophila melanogasater: a logical analysis,9446747,10.1006/jtbi.1997.0523,"This report focuses on dorso-ventral patterning in the segmented region of the Drosophila melanogaster embryo. According to the concept of positional information, this pattern results from the different response of cells to the Dorsal-protein morphogen. This protein shows a distribution gradient along the dorso-ventral axis, with the highest concentration on the ventral side. Using the generalized logical formalism developed by R. Thomas and co-workers, the different cellular responses were analysed in terms of the intracellular loops between the regulatory genes. Two positive loops were found to be involved, each constituting a switch which can be acted upon by the Dorsal morphogen to determine the different cell types that make up the embryonic dorso-ventral pattern. The novelty in this use of generalized logical formalism is the employment of a multilevel variable to represent a morphogen gradient. The proposed model accounts for the essential qualitative effects of the Dorsal gradient in the dorso-ventral determination process. Three main conclusions may be drawn. Firstly, the gene twist needs to have two functional threshold concentrations, one for autoactivation and the other for activation of the gene snail. Secondly, the autoactivation threshold must be smaller than that which activates snail. Thirdly, the action of the gene snail on the maintenance function of the gene twist is crucial for cells to be able to choose between the mesoderm or neuroectoderm developmental pathways. Furthermore, it is predicted that if the gene snail shows autoregulation, this will not be crucial for the determination of the embryonic D-V pattern.

"Spiroplasmas: infectious agents of plants, arthropods and vertebrates",9286068,,"The spiroplasmas are mollicutes characterized by motility and helical morphology. They were discovered through studies on corn stunt and citrus stubborn diseases. The stubborn agent was the first mollicute of plant origin to be obtained in culture and the first cultured mollicute to possess a helical morphology. The citrus pathogen has been known as Spiroplasma citri since 1973. The corn stunt agent was cultured in 1975 and fully characterized as Spiroplasma kunkelii by 1986. The third and only other phytopathogenic spiroplasma is Spiroplasma phoeniceum, cultured from naturally infected periwinkle plants in Syria and described in 1986. These three spiroplasmas are restricted to the phloem sievetubes of the infected plants and are transmitted from plant by various phloem feeding leafhopper vectors in which the spiroplasmas multiply. Following the pioneering work on S. citri and S. kunkelii, close to fifty other spiroplasma species or proposed species have been discovered. All spiroplasmas have been isolated from insects, ticks and plants. Insects are particularly rich sources of spiroplasmas. Some insect-derived spiroplasmas are entomopathogens. S. melliferum and S. apis are honey bee pathogens. They cross the insect-gut barrier and reach the hemolymph, where they multiply abundantly and kill the bee. Spiroplasma floricola is the agent of lethargy disease of Melolontha melolontha (cockchafer). Spiroplasma poulsonii infects the neotropical species of Drosophila, is transmitted transovarially and kills the male progeny of an infected female fly, hence the name sex ratio spiroplasma. Some insect-derived spiroplasmas are also found on plant (flower) surfaces. For instance, S. apis was cultured from the surfaces of flowers growing in the vicinity of affected beehives. This suggests that the plant surface spiroplasmas are deposited on these surfaces by contaminated insects. Many insect spiroplasmas are not pathogenic, are often restricted to the gut and may be regarded as mutualists or incidental commensals. Of the three known tick spiroplasmas, only Spiroplasma mirum obtained from rabbit ticks is pathogenic to the vertebrate animal (chick embryo, new-born rodents, adult rabbit), but only upon experimental inoculation of the spiroplasma. Strain SMCA induces high incidence of cataracts in new born rodents. With strain GT-48 no cataracts are observed, but fatal encephalitis occurs. Spiral membranous inclusions resembling spiroplasmas have been seen in brain biopsies taken from patients with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. However, failure to detect spiroplasmas by serology and culture points to the absence of spiroplasmal involvement in spongiform encephalopathies. Transposon Tn 4001 mutagenesis has been applied for the first time to Spiroplasma citri, and pathogenicity can now be studied at the genetic level. One Tn 4001 mutant does not multiply in the leafhoppers and is, therefore, not transmitted to the plant. Another mutant multiplies well in the plant and is transmitted to the plant, where it reaches high titers, but without inducing symptoms in the plant. In this non-phytopathogenic mutant, Tn 4001 is inserted in the spiroplasmal fructose operon, and the mutant is unable to use fructose. Finally, to study involvement of spiroplasmal motility in pathogenicity, a non-motile mutant has been obtained. Motility was restored by complementation with the wild type genes. This is the first time that successful complementation has been reported, not only in the spiroplasmas but in the mollicutes in general. Undoubtedly, studies on pathogenicity have entered a new era.",1997,J M Bové

Zebrafish vasa homologue RNA is localized to the cleavage planes of 2- and 4-cell-stage embryos and is expressed in the primordial germ cells,9272956,,"Identification and manipulation of the germ line are important to the study of model organisms. Although zebrafish has recently emerged as a model for vertebrate development, the primordial germ cells (PGCs) in this organism have not been previously described. To identify a molecular marker for the zebrafish PGCs, we cloned the zebrafish homologue of the Drosophila vasa gene, which, in the fly, encodes a germ-cell-specific protein. Northern blotting revealed that zebrafish vasa homologue (vas) transcript is present in embryos just after fertilization, and hence it is probably maternally supplied. Using whole-mount in situ hybridization, we investigated the expression pattern of vas RNA in zebrafish embryos from the 1-cell stage to 10 days of development. Here we present evidence that vas RNA is a germ-cell-specific marker, allowing a description of the zebrafish PGCs for the first time. Furthermore, vas transcript was detected in a novel pattern, localized to the cleavage planes in 2- and 4-cell-stage embryos. During subsequent cleavages, the RNA is segregated as subcellular clumps to a small number of cells that may be the future germ cells. These results suggest new ways in which one might develop techniques for the genetic manipulation of zebrafish. Furthermore, they provide the basis for further studies on this novel RNA localization pattern and on germ-line development in general.",1997,"C Yoon, K Kawakami, N Hopkins"

Regulated splicing of the Drosophila sex-lethal male exon involves a blockage mechanism,8441386,10.1128/mcb.13.3.1408,"In Drosophila melanogaster, sex determination in somatic cells is controlled by a cascade of genes whose expression is regulated by alternative splicing [B. S. Baker, Nature (London) 340:521-524, 1989; J. Hodgkin, Cell 56:905-906, 1989]. The master switch gene in this hierarchy is Sex-lethal. Sex-lethal is turned on only in females, and an autoregulatory feedback loop which controls alternative splicing maintains this state (L. R. Bell, J. I. Horabin, P. Schedl, and T. W. Cline, Cell 65:229-239, 1991; L. N. Keyes, T. W. Cline, and P. Schedl, Cell 68:933-943, 1992). Sex-lethal also promotes female differentiation by controlling the splicing of RNA from the next gene in the hierarchy, transformer. Sosnowski et al. (B. A. Sosnowski, J. M. Belote, and M. McKeown, Cell 58:449-459, 1989) have shown that the mechanism for generating female transformer transcripts is not through the activation of the alternative splice site but by the blockage of the default splice site. We have tested whether an activation or a blockage mechanism is involved in Sex-lethal autoregulation. The male exon of Sex-lethal with flanking splice sites was placed into the introns of heterologous genes. Our results support the blockage mechanism. The poly(U) run at the male exon 3' splice site is required for sex-specific splicing. However, unlike transformer, default splicing to the male exon is sensitive to the sequence context within which the exon resides. This and the observation that the splice signals at the exon are suboptimal are discussed with regard to alternate splicing.",1993,"P Schedl, J I Horabin"
Laboratory and natural heritabilities of male courtship song characters in Drosophila montana and D. littoralis,8496069,10.1038/hdy.1993.56,"We estimated heritabilities for several male courtship song characters in two Drosophila species using father-son regression under conditions where both fathers and sons had been raised in the laboratory.

In D. littoralis the heritabilities of song characters were generally lower (-0.33 to 0.18), and none of them was significantly larger than zero. We also estimated heritabilities regressing characters of wild-caught fathers with those of their laboratory reared sons, and used the method employed by Riska et al. to estimate the lower bound of heritabilities in nature. In D. montana most and in D. littoralis all of the across-environment heritabilities were non-significant (-0.15 to 0.43 and -0.04 to 0.15, respectively), and in some cases the across-environment heritabilities were significantly lower than the heritabilities measured under laboratory conditions. The low across-environment heritabilities appeared to be due to larger phenotypic variability of song characters in the field and in some cases also due to genotype-environment interactions.",1993,"J Aspi, A Hoikkala"
A new biological rhythm mutant of Drosophila melanogaster that identifies a gene with an essential embryonic function,8307324,,"To identify components of a circadian pacemaker output pathway, we have sought Drosophila mutations that alter the timing of eclosion but do not perturb circadian period or the expression of the activity rhythm. A mutant named lark has been identified, for which daily peaks of eclosion occur abnormally early while populations are synchronized to either light/dark or temperature cycles. The temporal phasing of locomotor activity in lark mutants, however, is entirely normal, as is the free-running period of the circadian pacemaker. The lark strain carries a single P-element insertion which, interestingly, has a dominant effect on the timing of eclosion, but is also associated with a recessive embryonic lethal phenotype. The analysis of excision-generated alleles suggests that the lark gene encodes an essential function. This function is apparently mediated by a transcription unit that is interrupted by the P-induced lark mutation. A combination of in situ hybridization analysis and reporter (beta-gal) staining indicates that this transcription unit expresses mRNAs throughout the embryonic central nervous system and in a defined subset of cells in the nervous system of pharate adults. RNAs are first detected at about embryonic stage 11, just prior to the stage at which lethality occurs in lark homozygotes. Based primarily on the observed mutant phenotypes, a function is proposed for the LARK product(s) that is consistent with the pleiotropic nature of lark mutations.",1993,"L M Newby, F R Jackson"
Programmed cell death in the Drosophila CNS is ecdysone-regulated and coupled with a specific ecdysone receptor isoform,8306887,,"At adult emergence, the ventral CNS of Drosophila shows a group of approximately 300 neurons, which are unique in that they express 10-fold higher levels of the A isoform of the ecdysone receptor (EcR-A) than do other central neurons. This expression pattern is established early in metamorphosis and persists throughout the remainder of the pupal stage. Although these cells represent a heterogeneous group of neurons, they all share the same fate of undergoing rapid degeneration after the adult emerges from the pupal case. One prerequisite for this death is the decline of ecdysteroids at the end of metamorphosis. Treatment of flies with 20-hydroxyecdysone blocks the death of the cells, but only if given at least 3 hours before the normal time of degeneration. The correlation of a unique pattern of receptor isoform expression with a particular steroid-regulated fate suggests that variations in the pattern of receptor isoform expression may serve as important switches during development.",1993,"W S Talbot, J W Truman, S Robinow, D S Hogness"
A point mutation in a Drosophila GABA receptor confers insecticide resistance,8389005,10.1038/363449a0,"Vertebrates and invertebrates both have GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) as a major inhibitory neurotransmitter. GABAA receptors in vertebrates assemble as heteromultimers to form an integral chloride ion channel. These receptors are targets for drugs and pesticides and are also implicated in seizure-related diseases. Picrotoxinin (PTX) and cyclodiene insecticides are GABAA receptor antagonists which competitively displace each other from the same binding site. Insects and vertebrates showing resistance to cyclodienes also show cross-resistance to PTX. Previously, we used a field-isolated Drosophila mutant Rdl (Resistant to dieldrin) insensitive to PTX and cyclodienes to clone a putative GABA receptor. Here we report the functional expression and novel pharmacology of this GABA receptor and examine the functionality of a resistance-associated point mutation (alanine to serine) within the second membrane-spanning domain, the region thought to line the chloride ion channel pore. This substitution is found globally in Drosophila populations. This mutation not only identifies a single amino acid conferring high levels of resistance to the important GABA receptor antagonist PTX but also, by conferring resistance to cyclodienes, may account for over 60% of reported cases of insecticide resistance.",1993,"R H Ffrench-Constant, T A Rocheleau, J C Steichen, A E Chalmers"

This protein (termed Delta-like or dlk) is highly homologous to invertebrate homeotic proteins, including Delta, and Notch, the products of neurogenic loci involved in normal neural differentiation in Drosophila. dlk is expressed in tumors with neuroendocrine features, such as neuroblastoma, pheochromocytoma, and a subset of SCLC cell lines. However, its expression in normal tissues is restricted to the adrenal gland and placenta. These data suggest that dlk may be involved in neuroendocrine differentiation and, because of its cellular location and restricted expression in normal tissues, it may be a potential therapeutic target in neuroendocrine tumors, particularly SCLC.",1993,"V Notario, E A Sausville, J Laborda, T Hoffman"
Guanine-nucleotide-releasing factor hSos1 binds to Grb2 and links receptor tyrosine kinases to Ras signalling,8479541,10.1038/363085a0,"Many of the actions of receptor tyrosine kinases are mediated by the protein Ras, including the activation of various downstream serine/threonine kinases and the stimulation of growth and differentiation. The human protein Grb2 binds to ligand-activated growth factor receptors and downstream effector proteins through its Src-homology (SH) domains SH2 and SH3, respectively, and like its homologue from Caenorhabditis elegans, Sem-5, apparently forms part of a highly conserved pathway by which these receptors can control Ras activity. Here we show that the SH3 domains of Grb2 bind to the carboxy-terminal part of hSos1, the human homologue of the Drosophila guanine-nucleotide-releasing factor for Ras, which is essential for control of Ras activity by epidermal growth factor receptor and sevenless. Moreover, a synthetic 10-amino-acid peptide containing the sequence PPVPPR specifically blocks the interaction. These results indicate that the Grb2/hSos1 complex couples activated EGF receptor to Ras signalling.",1993,"E Skolnik, N Li, D Bar-Sagi, P Chardin, R Daly, B Margolis, J Schlessinger, V Yajnik, A Batzer"
Cultured Aedes albopictus mosquito cells synthesize hormone-inducible proteins,8118617,10.1007/BF02634349,"To provide a framework for biochemical investigation of ecdysteroid action in Aedes albopictus mosquito cells, we examined the effect of 20-hydroxyecdysone on cell growth and morphology, synthesis of inducible proteins (EIPs), and expression of a transfected gene regulated by a synthetic ecdysteroid response element. When cells were cultured in the continuous presence of 10(-6) M 20-hydroxyecdysone, the rate of growth decreased and subtle changes in cell morphology were observed. In both Aedes aegypti and A. albopictus cells, synthesis of a small number of radiolabeled proteins, which appeared as minor bands on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels, was induced by treatment with 20-hydroxyecdysone. On two-dimensional polyacrylamide gels, 11 EIPs, ranging in size from approximately 22 to 52 kDa, were identified in A. albopictus C7-10 cells. Ten inducible proteins were localized in the cytoplasmic fraction; EIP28 and EIP31 were detected in both cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts, and EIP29 was detected only in the nucleus, at a very low level. None of these proteins corresponded to small heat shock proteins, whose genes are 20-hydroxyecdysone-inducible in some Drosophila cell lines. The juvenile hormone analog, methoprene, induced expression of a 25 kDa protein in C7-10 cells. Although 20-hydroxyecdysone sustained the synthesis of this methoprene-inducible protein, synthesis did not occur in the presence of 20-hydroxyecdysone alone. In transfected A. albopictus cells, expression of a recombinant DNA construct containing two tandem synthetic ecdysteroid regulatory elements based on a D. melanogaster small heat shock protein gene was modestly induced by 20-hydroxyecdysone.",1993,"Q Lan, A M Fallon, A Gerenday"
Bidirectional selection for female receptivity in Drosophila melanogaster,8476394,10.1007/BF01067556,"A wild population of Drosophila melanogaster was subjected to selection for high and low female receptivity. Selection was only applied in females on the basis of the mating times observed in a 30-min period. We applied a selection paradigm that allowed us to conclude that females unmated after 30 min correspond to the truncated upper tail of the distribution underlying mating times. Selection was successful, with mean mating times of about 5 min for the high lines, 35 min for the low lines, and 12 min for the control. Receptivity of the selection lines remained steady after 42 generations of relaxed selection, suggesting a lack of natural selection on receptivity in laboratory conditions. We also found a clear relationship between high or low receptivity and high or low frequency of hybridization with D. simulans males, emphasizing the role of female receptivity in maintaining isolation with its sibling species D. simulans.",1993,"J I Izquierdo, R Piñeiro, P Casares, M C Carracedo"
Mechanisms of dorsal-ventral axis determination in Drosophila embryos revealed by cytoplasmic transplantations,8404539,,"The establishment of the dorsal-ventral pattern in Drosophila embryos depends on a signal transduction process: a putative extracellular ligand released into the perivitelline space surrounding the embryo binds to the Toll receptor. Toll activation triggers the formation of the nuclear gradient of dorsal protein, the morphogen of the dorsal-ventral axis. Here, I analyse the dorsal protein distribution and the expression of zygotic dorsal-ventral genes in Toll- embryos that have been injected with wild-type cytoplasm under a variety of different injection conditions. Injections into two positions within a single embryo lead to the formation of two dorsal-ventral patterns in one embryo, allowing the analysis of interactions between pattern-forming processes. The results of single and double injections suggest that the spatial information for the embryonic dorsal-ventral axis is largely derived from spatial cues present in the extraembryonic compartment, which restrict the release of the putative Toll ligand. They argue against a Toll-dependent pattern-formation process employing local self-enhancement and lateral inhibition to enhance a weak initial asymmetry. The putative Toll ligand appears to originate from a ventrally restricted zone which extends along the entire anterior-posterior axis. Ligand diffusion or its graded release are required to determine the slope of the nuclear dorsal protein gradient. Both the Toll receptor and the putative ligand of Toll are in excess in wild-type embryos. Since spatial information for the embryonic dorsal-ventral axis is already present in the vitelline membrane or the perivitelline space, it is most likely generated during oogenesis. Oogenic pattern formation is also responsible for the perpendicular orientation the dorsal-ventral axis maintains with respect to the anterior-posterior axis.",1993,S Roth
Spatially localized rhomboid is required for establishment of the dorsal-ventral axis in Drosophila oogenesis,8500182,10.1016/0092-8674(93)90273-s,"The establishment of dorsal-ventral asymmetry of the Drosophila embryo requires a group of genes that act maternally. None of the previously identified dorsal-ventral axis genes are known to produce asymmetrically localized gene products during oogenesis. We show that rhomboid (rho), a novel member of this group, encodes a protein that is localized on the apical surface of the dorsal-anterior follicle cells surrounding the oocyte. Loss of rho function causes ventralization of the eggshell and the embryo, whereas ectopic expression leads to dorsalization of both structures. Thus, spatially restricted rho is necessary and sufficient for dorsal-ventral axis formation. We propose, based on these observations and double mutant experiments, that the spatially restricted rho protein leads to selective activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor in the dorsal follicle cells and subsequently the specification of the dorsal follicle cells.",1993,"Y N Jan, L Y Jan, D Baker, H Ruohola-Baker, T B Chou, E Grell"

Temperature related fertility selection on body size and the sex-ratio gene arrangement in Drosophila pseudoobscura,8405993,10.1017/s0016672300031578,"We measured temperature-dependent fertility selection on body size in Drosophila pseudoobscura in the laboratory. One hundred single females of each of the three karyotypes involving the 'sex-ratio' (SR) and the standard (ST) gene arrangement on the sex chromosome laid eggs at either 18 or 24 degrees C. The experiment addressed the following hypotheses: (a) Fertility selection on body size is weaker at the higher temperature, explaining in part why genetically smaller flies appear to evolve in populations at warmer localities. (b) Homokaryotypic SR females are less fecund than homokaryotypic ST females, possibly mediated by the effect of body size on fertility, explaining the low frequencies of SR despite its strong advantage due to meiotic drive. The data were also expected to shed light on a mechanism for the evolution of plasticity of body size through fertility selection in environments with an unpredictable temperature regime. Hypothesis (a) was clearly refuted because phenotypically larger ST females had an even larger fertility surplus at the higher temperature and, more importantly, the genetic correlation between fertility and body size disappeared at the lower temperature. As to (b), we found that temperature affects fertility directly and indirectly through body size such that ST and SR females were about equally fecund at both temperatures, although different in size and size-adjusted fertility. We observed heterosis for both size and fertility, which might stabilize the polymorphism in nature. The reaction norms of body size to the temperature difference were steeper for ST females than for SR females, implying that fertility selection could change phenotypic plasticity of body size in a population. Selection on body size depended not only on the temperature, but also on the karyotypes, suggesting that models of phenotype evolution using purely phenotypic fitness functions may often be inadequate.",1993,"W W Anderson, M D Gebhardt"
Effect of temperature on frequencies of spots in Drosophila wing-spot assay,8339725,10.1002/em.2850220109,"The effect of temperature on spontaneous mutation frequencies was studied in the Drosophila somatic mutation and recombination test. Transdihybrid mwh +/+ flr3 larvae were grown at various temperatures (15, 18, 20, 22, 25, 27, and 29 degrees C) in the absence of any chemical mutagen. Wings of surviving adults were removed and scored for presence of small single spots, large single spots, and twin spots. No significant effect of temperature was found on mean frequency per wing of twin spots. Similarly, no significant effect of temperature was found for large singles within the temperature range of 18-29 degrees C; however, at 15 degrees C, the mean frequency per wing of large spots was significantly elevated. A significant quadratic relationship was found between mean frequency of small spots and temperature. Frequency of small spots per wing was minimized within the temperature range of 20-27 degrees C and increased at higher and lower temperatures. Maximum frequency of small spots per wing was observed at 15 degrees C. The qualitative nature of the small single spots induced at high and low temperatures is unclear; they may represent slow-growing segmentally aneuploid (deleted) cells or possibly even monosomic cells. Both heat and cold were found to be mutagenic in the Drosophila wing-spot assay. However, the mutagenic potency associated with temperature was much less than that of most chemical mutagens, and no significant effect of temperature was observed in the range of 20-27 degrees C.",1993,"A J Katz, T A Foley"

The authors suggest that all these cells may be referred to the same type, possibly to polygonal phagocytic cells in different periods of their activity. These cells seem to play an important role in abortive oogenesis processes in mosquitoes. The more abnormal is ovariolar function, the more lumen cells this ovariole contains.

The Drosophila 110-kDa transcription factor TFIID subunit directly interacts with the N-terminal region of the 230-kDa subunit,8327460,10.1073/pnas.90.13.5896,"Transcription initiation factor TFIID is a multimeric protein complex that plays a central role in transcriptional regulation by facilitating promoter responses to various activators. cDNAs encoding the 110-kDa subunit of Drosophila TFIID (p110) were isolated with a degenerate oligodeoxynucleotide probe based on an amino acid sequence of the purified protein.

The recombinant protein expressed in Sf9 cells via a baculovirus vector interacts directly with the 230-kDa subunit of TFIID (p230). Together with the previous observation that the TATA box-binding subunit of TFIID (TFIID tau or TBP) interacts directly with only p230 among the TFIID subunits, this result suggests that p110 forms a complex with TFIID tau via p230.

Prospective and retrospective tests of evolutionary theories of senescence,15374351,10.1016/0167-4943(93)90023-b,"Retrospective and prospective methods in the study of the evolution of longevity and senescence are compared. Retrospective studies can provide tests of evolutionary theories of senescence through the interpretation of evolutionary pattern demonstrated by species in nature. Patterns in longevity displayed by African rivulin fishes provide a clear and incisive example of the evolution of longevity and associated life history characters, but such tests are often difficult to find or unclear in the a posteriori interpretation of evolution that they offer. Far more experimentation of the prospective kind has been applied to testing theories of life span. Though prospective tests of evolutionary theory are compromised to a degree by the artificiality of the laboratory environment, experiments performed there are not necessarily invalid. In addition, prospective tests offer the added impetus that theoretical predictions are tested a priori. The use of Drosophila melanogaster as a laboratory model for the study of longevity has provided a number of particularly enlightening recent advances describing the number and distribution of genes controlling longevity, the metabolic pathways by which other characters are physiologically associated with life span, and even the controlling genetic elements affecting those traits. Improvements in longevity shown under programs of selective breeding may be the result of adaptations in the glycolytic pathway altering the ability to utilize the sugar sucrose as a food source.",1993,L S Luckinbill
The kl-3 loop of the Y chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster binds a tektin-like protein,8454204,,"Primary spermatocyte nuclei of Drosophila melanogaster exhibit three giant lampbrush-like loops formed by the kl-5, kl-3 and ks-1 Y-chromosome fertility factors. These structures contain and abundantly transcribe highly repetitive, simple sequence DNAs and accumulate large amounts of non-Y-encoded proteins. By immunizing mice with the 53-kD fraction (enriched in beta 2-tubulin) excised from a sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel loaded with Drosophila testis proteins we raised a polyclonal antibody, designated as T53-1, which decorates the kl-3 loop and the sperm flagellum. Two dimensional immunoblot analysis showed that the T53-1 antibody reacts with a single protein of about 53 kD, different from the tubulins and present both in X/Y and X/O males. Moreover, the antigen recognized by the T53-1 antibody proved to be testis-specific because it was detected in testes and seminal vesicles but not in other male tissues or in females. The characteristics of the protein recognized by the T53-1 antibody suggested that it might be a member of a class of axonemal proteins, the tektins, known to form Sarkosyl-urea insoluble filaments in the wall of flagellar microtubules. Purification of the Sarkosyl-urea insoluble fraction of D. melanogaster sperm revealed that it contains four polypeptides having molecular masses ranging from 51 to 57 kD. One of these polypeptides reacts strongly with the T53-1 antibody but none of them reacts with antitubulin antibodies. These results indicate that the kl-3 loop binds a non-Y encoded, testis-specific, tektin-like protein which is a constituent of the sperm flagellum. This finding supports the hypothesis that the Y loops fulfill a protein-binding function required for the proper assembly of the axoneme components.",1993,"S Bonaccorsi, C Pisano, M Gatti"
Arrestin function in inactivation of G protein-coupled receptor rhodopsin in vivo,8316831,10.1126/science.8316831,"Arrestins have been implicated in the regulation of many G protein-coupled receptor signaling cascades. Mutations in two Drosophila photoreceptor-specific arrestin genes, arrestin 1 and arrestin 2, were generated. Analysis of the light response in these mutants shows that the Arr1 and Arr2 proteins are mediators of rhodopsin inactivation and are essential for the termination of the phototransduction cascade in vivo. The saturation of arrestin function by an excess of activated rhodopsin is responsible for a continuously activated state of the photoreceptors known as the prolonged depolarized afterpotential. In the absence of arrestins, photoreceptors undergo light-dependent retinal degeneration as a result of the continued activity of the phototransduction cascade. These results demonstrate the fundamental requirement for members of the arrestin protein family in the regulation of G protein-coupled receptors and signaling cascades in vivo.",1993,"R W Hardy, P J Dolph, M Socolich, C S Zuker, N J Colley, R Ranganathan"
Growth cone choices of Drosophila motoneurons in response to muscle fiber mismatch,8426233,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.13-02-00714.1993,"In Drosophila embryos, each motoneuron is accurately matched to one or more singly identifiable muscle fibers. In this article we altered the number and pattern of the embryonic muscle fibers using genetic, heat shock, and laser ablation methods to test whether motoneuron growth cones are able to recognize specific targets. The choices made by two motoneurons were assayed using both intracellular dye fills and immunocytochemistry. The motoneurons RP1 and RP3 have nearly identical central and peripheral axonal trajectories. However, RP3 innervates the two most ventral longitudinal muscle fibers, 7 and 6, while RP1 grows past these fibers to innervate only muscle fiber 13. In rhomboid mutants muscle fiber 7 does not develop. Despite the loss of one of its targets, RP3 faithfully innervated the remaining muscle fiber 6 in over 80% of the observed cases. Furthermore, neuron RP1 accurately innervated muscle fiber 13, although it traversed one fiber fewer to reach it. Laser ablation of muscle fiber 7 confirmed the target choices shown by the motoneurons. In numb mutants, multiple muscle fibers, including 7, 13, and 12, fail to develop. This allowed us to test whether fibers distal to the target are involved in muscle fiber recognition, possibly by halting the growth cone advance. In mutant embryos, RP3 innervated muscle fiber 6 at the same frequency regardless of the absence of the distal muscle fiber 13. By contrast, RP1, which had lost its target entirely, frequently failed to innervate any muscle fiber during the period examined. Finally, muscle fiber 13 can be duplicated in wild-type embryos by means of a brief heat pulse during myogenesis. Presented with two targets, RP1 innervated both fibers in each case examined, while RP3 synapsed with muscle fibers 7 and 6 normally. Neuron-specific antibodies revealed that the embryonic growth cone choices were not transient, but persisted into the larval neuromuscular projections. These results indicate that each motoneuron growth cone has a primary target preference, which is retained even when the numbers of the muscle fibers, and therefore their relative positions, are altered. We therefore suggest that synaptic recognition by Drosophila motoneuron growth cones relies on unique features of the individual muscle fibers.",1993,"S Cash, H Keshishian, A Chiba, H Hing"
Inferences of demography and selection in an African population of Drosophila melanogaster,23105013,10.1534/genetics.112.145318,"It remains a central problem in population genetics to infer the past action of natural selection, and these inferences pose a challenge because demographic events will also substantially affect patterns of polymorphism and divergence. Thus it is imperative to explicitly model the underlying demographic history of the population whenever making inferences about natural selection. In light of the considerable interest in adaptation in African populations of Drosophila melanogaster, which are considered ancestral to the species, we generated a large polymorphism data set representing 2.1 Mb from each of 20 individuals from a Ugandan population of D. melanogaster. In contrast to previous inferences of a simple population expansion in eastern Africa, our demographic modeling of this ancestral population reveals a strong signature of a population bottleneck followed by population expansion, which has significant implications for future demographic modeling of derived populations of this species. Taking this more complex underlying demographic history into account, we also estimate a mean X-linked region-wide rate of adaptation of 6 × 10(-11)/site/generation and a mean selection coefficient of beneficial mutations of 0.0009. These inferences regarding the rate and strength of selection are largely consistent with most other estimates from D. melanogaster and indicate a relatively high rate of adaptation driven by weakly beneficial mutations.",2013,"Jeffrey D Jensen, Charles F Aquadro, Andrew G Clark, Nadia D Singh"
Evidence for a radial SNARE super-complex mediating neurotransmitter release at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction,23687382,10.1242/jcs.123802,"The SNARE proteins VAMP/synaptobrevin, SNAP-25 and syntaxin are core components of the apparatus that mediates neurotransmitter release.

Experiments performed with botulinum neurotoxins led to the identification of one arginine residue in SNAP-25 and one aspartate residue in syntaxin (R206 and D253 in Drosophila melanogaster). These residues are highly conserved and predicted to play a major role in the protein-protein interactions between SNARE complexes by forming an ionic couple. Accordingly, we generated transgenic Drosophila lines expressing SNAREs mutated in these residues and performed an electrophysiological analysis of their neuromuscular junctions. Our results indicate that SNAP-25-R206 and syntaxin-D253 play a major role in neuroexocytosis and support a radial assembly of several SNARE complexes interacting via the ionic couple formed by these two residues.",2013,"Aram Megighian, Sergio Pantano, Ornella Rossetto, Mauro Zordan, Michela Rigoni, Michele Scorzeto, Damiano Zanini, Cesare Montecucco"

In the Drosophila central brain, around 200 neural stem cells called neuroblasts undergo repeated rounds of asymmetric cell division. These divisions typically generate a larger self-renewing neuroblast and a smaller ganglion mother cell that undergoes one terminal division to create two differentiating neurons. Although single mitotic divisions of neuroblasts can easily be imaged in real time, the lack of long term imaging procedures has limited the use of neuroblast live imaging for lineage analysis. Here we describe a method that allows live imaging of cultured Drosophila neuroblasts over multiple cell cycles for up to 24 hours. We describe a 4D image analysis protocol that can be used to extract cell cycle times and growth rates from the resulting movies in an automated manner. We use it to perform lineage analysis in type II neuroblasts where clonal analysis has indicated the presence of a transit-amplifying population that potentiates the number of neurons. Indeed, our experiments verify type II lineages and provide quantitative parameters for all cell types in those lineages. As defects in type II neuroblast lineages can result in brain tumor formation, our lineage analysis method will allow more detailed and quantitative analysis of tumorigenesis and asymmetric cell division in the Drosophila brain.",2013,"Christian Berger, Thomas Lendl, Juergen A Knoblich, Ilka Reichardt, Catarina C F Homem"
Parasitoid wasp virulence: A window into fly immunity,24088661,10.4161/fly.26484,"In nature, larvae of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster are commonly infected by parasitoid wasps. Following infection, flies mount an immune response termed cellular encapsulation in which fly immune cells form a multilayered capsule that covers and kills the wasp egg. Parasitoids have thus evolved virulence factors to suppress cellular encapsulation. To uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying the antiwasp response, we and others have begun identifying and functionally characterizing these virulence factors. Our recent work on the Drosophila parasitoid Ganaspis sp.1 has demonstrated that a virulence factor encoding a SERCA-type calcium pump plays an important role in Ganaspis sp.1 virulence. This venom SERCA antagonizes fly immune cell calcium signaling and thereby prevents the activation of the encapsulation response. In this way, the study of wasp virulence factors has revealed a novel aspect of fly immunity, namely a role for calcium signaling in fly immune cell activation, which is conserved with human immunity, again illustrating the marked conservation between fly and mammalian immune responses. Our findings demonstrate that the cellular encapsulation response can serve as a model of immune cell function and can also provide valuable insight into basic cell biological processes.",2013,Nathan T Mortimer
"Bmdelta phenotype implies involvement of Notch signaling in body segmentation and appendage development of silkworm, Bombyx mori",23142088,10.1016/j.asd.2012.10.002,"The domesticated silkworm, Bombyx mori, belongs to the intermediate germband insects, in which the anterior segments are specified in the blastoderm, while the remaining posterior segments are sequentially generated from the cellularized growth zone. The pattern formation is distinct from Drosophila but somewhat resembles a vertebrate. Notch signaling is involved in the segmentation of vertebrates and spiders. Here, we studied the function of Notch signaling in silkworm embryogenesis via RNA interference (RNAi). Depletion of Bmdelta, the homolog of the Notch signaling ligand, led to severe defects in segment patterning, including a loss of posterior segments and irregular segment boundaries. The paired appendages on each segment were symmetrically fused along the ventral midline in Bmdelta RNAi embryos. An individual segment seemed to possess only one segmental appendage. Segmentation in prolegs could be observed. Our results show that Notch signaling is employed in not only appendage development but also body segmentation. Thus, conservation of Notch-mediated segmentation could also be extended to holometabolous insects. The involvement of Notch signaling seems to be the ancestral segmentation mechanism of arthropods.",2013,Wenbin Liu
The binding of multiple nuclear receptors to a single regulatory region is important for the proper expression of EDG84A in Drosophila melanogaster,23137796,10.1016/j.jmb.2012.10.020,"Nuclear receptor transcription factor family members share target sequence similarity; however, little is known about how these factors exert their specific regulatory control. Here, we examine the mechanism regulating the expression of the Drosophila EDG84A gene, a target gene of the orphan nuclear receptor βFTZ-F1, as a model to study the cooperative behavior among nuclear receptors. We show that the three nuclear receptors βFTZ-F1, DHR3, and DHR39 bind to a common element in the EDG84A promoter. The expression level of the EDG84A promoter-lacZ reporter genes in DHR39-induced and mutant animals, respectively, suggests that DHR39 works as a repressor. The activity of a reporter gene carrying a mutation preventing DHR3 binding was reduced in ftz-f1 mutants and rescued by the induced expression of βFTZ-F1, suggesting that DHR3 and βFTZ-F1 activate the EDG84A gene in a redundant manner. A reporter gene carrying a mutation that abolishes DHR39 and FTZ-F1 binding was prematurely expressed, and the expression level of the reporter gene carrying a mutation preventing DHR3 binding was reduced. These findings suggest that the temporal expression of this gene is mainly controlled by βFTZ-F1 but that the binding of DHR3 is also important. Comparison of the binding site sequence among Drosophila species suggests that DHR3 binding ability was gained after the melanogaster subgroup evolved, and this ability may contribute to the robust expression of this gene. These results show the complicated regulatory mechanisms utilized by multiple nuclear receptors to properly regulate the expression of their target gene through a single target site.",2013,"Yuji Kageyama, Yusuke Takakura, Susumu Hirose, Hitoshi Ueda, Kazutaka Akagi, Yasunari Kayashima"
Functional analysis of Drosophila DNA polymerase ε p58 subunit,24224125,,"DNA polymerase ε (polε) plays a central role in DNA replication in eukaryotic cells, and has been suggested to the main synthetic polymerase on the leading strand. It is a hetero-tetrameric enzyme, comprising a large catalytic subunit (the A subunit ~250 kDa), a B subunit of ~60 kDa in most species (~80 kDa in budding yeast) and two smaller subunits (each ~20 kDa). In Drosophila, two subunits of polε (dpolε) have been identified. One is the 255 kDa catalytic subunit (dpolεp255), and the other is the 58 kDa subunit (dpolεp58). The functions of the B subunit have been mainly studied in budding yeast and mammalian cell culture, few studies have been performed in the context of an intact multicellular organism and therefore its functions in this context remain poorly understood. To address this we examined the in vivo role of dpolεp58 in Drosophila. A homozygous dpolεp58 mutant is pupal lethal, and the imaginal discs are less developed in the third instar larvae. In the eye discs of this mutant S phases, as measured by BrdU incorporation assays, were significantly reduced. In addition staining with an anti-phospho histone H3 (PH3) antibody, (a marker of M phase), was increased in the posterior region of eye discs, where usually cells stop replicating and start differentiation. These results indicate that dpolεp58 is essential for Drosophila development and plays an important role in progression of S phase in mitotic cell cycles. We also observed that the size of nuclei in salivary gland cells were decreased in dpolεp58 mutant, indicating that dpolεp58 also plays a role in endoreplication. Furthermore we detect a putative functional interaction between dpolε and ORC2 in discs suggesting that polε plays a role in the initiation of DNA replication in Drosophila.",2013,"Osamu Suyari, Sue Cotterill, Ritsuko Sahashi, Masamitsu Yamaguchi, Hideki Yoshida, Mieko Kawai, Risa Matsuda"

Here, we fully characterise DmWRNexo exonuclease activity in vitro, confirming 3'-5' polarity, demonstrating a requirement for Mg(2+), inhibition by ATP, and an ability to degrade both single-stranded DNA and duplex DNA substrates with 3' or 5' overhangs, or bubble structures, but with no activity on blunt ended DNA duplexes. We report a novel active site mutation that ablates enzyme activity. Lesional substrates containing uracil are partially cleaved by DmWRNexo, but the enzyme pauses on such substrates and is inhibited by abasic sites. These strong biochemical similarities to human WRN suggest that Drosophila can provide a valuable experimental system for analysing the importance of WRN exonuclease in cell and organismal ageing.",2013,"Timothy Robbins, Lynne S Cox, Penelope A Mason, Ivan Boubriak, Ralph Lasala, Robert Saunders"
The Nme gene family in fish,22484598,10.1007/s10695-012-9639-8,"The Nme gene family, also known as Nm23 or NDPK, is a very ancient gene family that can be found in all kingdoms of life. In the late eighties, a gene of the Nme family, NME1, was identified as the first metastatic suppressor gene, resulting in a major interest for this family. Due to the complexity of the family, the need for a unified and evolutionary-supported gene nomenclature was recently stressed by the scientific community. Based on a complete evolutionary history study of the gene family in metazoans and vertebrates, a unified nomenclature was recently proposed and accepted by gene nomenclature consortia. In addition to its well-documented role in tumor metastasis, members of the Nme family are also involved in a wide variety of cellular and physiological processes. Available data in non-mammalian species remain, however, scarce with the noticeable exception of Drosophila in which a major role in development was reported. In fish, very few studies have specifically investigated the role of nme genes. Several transcriptomic and proteomic studies have, however, revealed the expression of nme genes in various fish organs and tissues, in mature oocytes, and during embryonic development. Altogether, interest for the Nme gene family in fish is growing and new functions/roles in fish biology are expected to be discovered in the forthcoming years. Here, we briefly review the current knowledge of the Nme family in fish.",2013,"A Fostier, T Desvignes, C Fauvel, J Bobe"
RNA editing regulates transposon-mediated heterochromatic gene silencing,24201902,10.1038/ncomms3745,"Heterochromatin formation drives epigenetic mechanisms associated with silenced gene expression. Repressive heterochromatin is established through the RNA interference pathway, triggered by double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) that can be modified via RNA editing. However, the biological consequences of such modifications remain enigmatic. Here we show that RNA editing regulates heterochromatic gene silencing in Drosophila. We utilize the binding activity of an RNA-editing enzyme to visualize the in vivo production of a long dsRNA trigger mediated by Hoppel transposable elements. Using homologous recombination, we delete this trigger, dramatically altering heterochromatic gene silencing and chromatin architecture. Furthermore, we show that the trigger RNA is edited and that dADAR serves as a key regulator of chromatin state. Additionally, dADAR auto-editing generates a natural suppressor of gene silencing. Lastly, systemic differences in RNA editing activity generates interindividual variation in silencing state within a population. Our data reveal a global role for RNA editing in regulating gene expression.",2013,"Rachel Whitaker, Michael R Tackett, Robert A Reenan, Yiannis A Savva, Georges St Laurent, Guyu Du, Philipp Kapranov, Yao-Jen Chang, James E C Jepson, Stephen L Helfand, Nan Jiang, Brian C Jones"
The Drosophila early ovarian transcriptome provides insight to the molecular causes of recombination rate variation across genomes,24228734,10.1186/1471-2164-14-794,"Background: Evidence in yeast indicates that gene expression is correlated with recombination activity and double-strand break (DSB) formation in some hotspots. Studies of nucleosome occupancy in yeast and mice also suggest that open chromatin influences the formation of DSBs. In Drosophila melanogaster, high-resolution recombination maps show an excess of DSBs within annotated transcripts relative to intergenic sequences. The impact of active transcription on recombination landscapes, however, remains unexplored in a multicellular organism. We then investigated the transcription profile during early meiosis in D. melanogaster females to obtain a glimpse at the relevant transcriptional dynamics during DSB formation, and test the specific hypothesis that DSBs preferentially target transcriptionally active genomic regions. Results: Our study of transcript profiles of early- and late-meiosis using mRNA-seq revealed, 1) significant differences in gene expression, 2) new genes and exons, 3) parent-of-origin effects on transcription in early-meiosis stages, and 4) a nonrandom genomic distribution of transcribed genes. Importantly, genomic regions that are more actively transcribed during early meiosis show higher rates of recombination, and we ruled out DSB preference for genic regions that are not transcribed. Conclusions: Our results provide evidence in a multicellular organism that transcription during the initial phases of meiosis increases the likelihood of DSB and give insight into the molecular determinants of recombination rate variation across the D. melanogaster genome. We propose that a model where variation in gene expression plays a role altering the recombination landscape across the genome could provide a molecular, heritable and plastic mechanism to observed patterns of recombination variation, from the high level of intra-specific variation to the known influence of environmental factors and stress conditions.",2013,"Josep M Comeron, Andrew B Adrian"
Three-dimensional tracking and behaviour monitoring of multiple fruit flies,23034355,10.1098/rsif.2012.0547,"The increasing interest in the investigation of social behaviours of a group of animals has heightened the need for developing tools that provide robust quantitative data. Drosophila melanogaster has emerged as an attractive model for behavioural analysis; however, there are still limited ways to monitor fly behaviour in a quantitative manner. To study social behaviour of a group of flies, acquiring the position of each individual over time is crucial. There are several studies that have tried to solve this problem and make this data acquisition automated. However, none of these studies has addressed the problem of keeping track of flies for a long period of time in three-dimensional space. Recently, we have developed an approach that enables us to detect and keep track of multiple flies in a three-dimensional arena for a long period of time, using multiple synchronized and calibrated cameras. After detecting flies in each view, correspondence between views is established using a novel approach we call the 'sequential Hungarian algorithm'. Subsequently, the three-dimensional positions of flies in space are reconstructed. We use the Hungarian algorithm and Kalman filter together for data association and tracking. We evaluated rigorously the system's performance for tracking and behaviour detection in multiple experiments, using from one to seven flies. Overall, this system presents a powerful new method for studying complex social interactions in a three-dimensional environment.",2013,"Julia B Saltz, Anurag Biyani, Sergey Nuzhdin, Justin E Dalton, Reza Ardekani, Simon Tavaré, John Tower, Michelle N Arbeitman"
Evolving concepts of gliogenesis: a look way back and ahead to the next 25 years,24183014,10.1016/j.neuron.2013.10.034,"Glial cells are present in all organisms with a CNS and, with increasing brain complexity, glial cells have undergone substantive increases in cell number, diversity, and functions. Invertebrates, such as Drosophila, possess glial subtypes with similarity to mammalian astrocytes in their basic morphology and function, representing fertile ground for unraveling fundamental aspects of glial biology. Although glial subtypes in simple organisms may be relatively homogenous, emerging evidence suggests the possibility that mammalian astrocytes might be highly diversified to match the needs of local neuronal subtypes. In this Perspective, we review classic and new roles identified for astrocytes and oligodendrocytes by recent studies. We propose that delineating genetic and developmental programs across species will be essential to understand the core functions of glia that allow enhanced neuronal function and to achieve new insights into glial roles in higher-order brain function and neurological disease.",2013,"Marc R Freeman, David H Rowitch"
RAMPAGE: promoter activity profiling by paired-end sequencing of 5'-complete cDNAs,24510412,10.1002/0471142727.mb25b11s104,"RNA annotation and mapping of promoters for analysis of gene expression (RAMPAGE) is a method that harnesses highly specific sequencing of 5'-complete complementary DNAs to identify transcription start sites (TSSs) genome-wide. Although TSS mapping has historically relied on detection of 5'-complete cDNAs, current genome-wide approaches typically have limited specificity and provide only scarce information regarding transcript structure. RAMPAGE allows for highly stringent selection of 5'-complete molecules, thus allowing base-resolution TSS identification with a high signal-to-noise ratio. Paired-end sequencing of medium-length cDNAs yields transcript structure information that is essential to interpreting the relationship of TSSs to annotated genes and transcripts. As opposed to standard RNA-seq, RAMPAGE explicitly yields accurate and highly reproducible expression level estimates for individual promoters. Moreover, this approach offers a streamlined 2- to 3-day protocol that is optimized for extensive sample multiplexing, and is therefore adapted for large-scale projects. This method has been applied successfully to human and Drosophila samples, and in principle should be applicable to any eukaryotic system.",2013,"Thomas R Gingeras, Philippe Batut"
Structural and functional conservation profiles of novel cathepsin L-like proteins identified in the Drosophila melanogaster genome,23256878,10.1080/07391102.2012.745379,"Cathepsin L is a cysteine protease which degrades connective tissue proteins including collagen, elastin, and fibronectin. In this study, five well-characterized cathepsin L proteins from different arthropods were used as query sequences for the Drosophila genome database. The search yielded 10 cathepsin L-like sequences, of which eight putatively represent novel cathepsin L-like proteins. To understand the phylogenetic relationship among these cathepsin L-like proteins, a phylogenetic tree was constructed based on their sequences. In addition, models of the tertiary structures of cathepsin L were constructed using homology modeling methods and subjected to molecular dynamics simulations to obtain reasonable structure to understand its dynamical behavior. Our findings demonstrate that all of the potential Drosophila cathepsin L-like proteins contain at least one cathepsin propeptide inhibitor domain. Multiple sequence alignment and homology models clearly highlight the conservation of active site residues, disulfide bonds, and amino acid residues critical for inhibitor binding.

The nuclear lamina regulates germline stem cell niche organization via modulation of EGFR signaling,23827710,10.1016/j.stem.2013.05.003,"Stem cell niche interactions have been studied extensively with regard to cell polarity and extracellular signaling. Less is known about the way in which signals and polarity cues integrate with intracellular structures to ensure appropriate niche organization and function. Here, we report that nuclear lamins function in the cyst stem cells (CySCs) of Drosophila testes to control the interaction of CySCs with the hub. This interaction is important for regulation of CySC differentiation and organization of the niche that supports the germline stem cells (GSCs). Lamin promotes nuclear retention of phosphorylated ERK in the CySC lineage by regulating the distribution of specific nucleoporins within the nuclear pores. Lamin-regulated nuclear epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor signaling in the CySC lineage is essential for proliferation and differentiation of the GSCs and the transient amplifying germ cells. Thus, we have uncovered a role for the nuclear lamina in the integration of EGF signaling to regulate stem cell niche function.",2013,"Yixian Zheng, Haiyang Chen, Xin Chen"
Extensive divergence of transcription factor binding in Drosophila embryos with highly conserved gene expression,24068946,10.1371/journal.pgen.1003748,"To better characterize how variation in regulatory sequences drives divergence in gene expression, we undertook a systematic study of transcription factor binding and gene expression in blastoderm embryos of four species, which sample much of the diversity in the 40 million-year old genus Drosophila: D. melanogaster, D. yakuba, D. pseudoobscura and D. virilis. We compared gene expression, measured by mRNA-seq, to the genome-wide binding, measured by ChIP-seq, of four transcription factors involved in early anterior-posterior patterning. We found that mRNA levels are much better conserved than individual transcription factor binding events, and that changes in a gene's expression were poorly explained by changes in adjacent transcription factor binding. However, highly bound sites, sites in regions bound by multiple factors and sites near genes are conserved more frequently than other binding, suggesting that a considerable amount of transcription factor binding is weakly or non-functional and not subject to purifying selection.",2013,"Susan E Lott, Tommy Kaplan, Mathilde Paris, Michael B Eisen, Jacqueline E Villalta, Xiao Yong Li"
Strong purifying selection at synonymous sites in D. melanogaster,23737754,10.1371/journal.pgen.1003527,"Synonymous sites are generally assumed to be subject to weak selective constraint. For this reason, they are often neglected as a possible source of important functional variation. We use site frequency spectra from deep population sequencing data to show that, contrary to this expectation, 22% of four-fold synonymous (4D) sites in Drosophila melanogaster evolve under very strong selective constraint while few, if any, appear to be under weak constraint. Linking polymorphism with divergence data, we further find that the fraction of synonymous sites exposed to strong purifying selection is higher for those positions that show slower evolution on the Drosophila phylogeny. The function underlying the inferred strong constraint appears to be separate from splicing enhancers, nucleosome positioning, and the translational optimization generating canonical codon bias. The fraction of synonymous sites under strong constraint within a gene correlates well with gene expression, particularly in the mid-late embryo, pupae, and adult developmental stages. Genes enriched in strongly constrained synonymous sites tend to be particularly functionally important and are often involved in key developmental pathways. Given that the observed widespread constraint acting on synonymous sites is likely not limited to Drosophila, the role of synonymous sites in genetic disease and adaptation should be reevaluated.",2013,"Ruth Hershberg, Philipp W Messer, David S Lawrie, Dmitri A Petrov"

Young flies needed fewer trials to reach the criterion than both middle-aged and old flies, which did not differ from each other. Extinction was delayed in the partial reinforcement groups by the same amount in all age groups. The slowest rate of extinction was observed in the old group and the fastest for the middle-aged flies.

Cloning of the esterase-5 locus from Drosophila pseudoobscura and comparison with its homologue in D. melanogaster,2178209,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a040624,"A clone of the esterase-5 (Est-5) gene from Drosophila pseudoobscura has been isolated by hybridization to the cloned Est-6 gene of D. melanogaster. Southern analysis and sequencing of the cloned DNA revealed three regions of similarity to Est-6 that have been tentatively identified as genes, Est-5A, Est-5B, and Est-5C. Introduction of each of the three genes separately into D. melanogaster by P-element transformation has demonstrated that Est-5B encodes an enzyme with the same physical properties as EST 5 in D. pseudoobscura. Sequence analysis indicates that Est-5B encodes a 545-amino-acid protein and is composed of two exons separated by a 55-bp intron in the same position as the 51-bp intron in Est-6. Comparison of the Est-5B coding region with that of Est-6 reveals an overall similarity (73% at both the nucleotide and amino acid levels) that is substantially lower than that for other genes sequenced in both of these species. Total nucleotide and nonsynonymous site differences between Est-6 and Est-5B are more abundant in the second exon than in the first, suggesting differential effects of selection or mutation on these two exons. Comparisons of the 5'-flanking DNA of Est-5B and Est-6 reveal four short conserved sequence elements, but the remaining upstream sequences show no significant similarity. Conservation in the 3'-flanking DNA is limited to the presence of two polyadenylation sites that may correlate with the existence of two transcripts from both Est-5B and Est-6. The patterns of nucleotide substitutions and amino acid replacements between Est-5B and Est-6 are consistent with the hypothesis that mutation and genetic drift are responsible for the differences between these two genes.",1990,"J G Oakeshott, J P Brady, R C Richmond"
Preferential insertion of P elements into genes expressed in the germ-line of Drosophila melanogaster,2177140,10.1007/BF00633856,"A Drosophila transposable element, the P element, containing the bacterial gene encoding beta-galactosidase is widely used to search for tissue-specific enhancers. This lac-Z-containing P element (P-lacZ ry+) can be moved around the genome by a number of techniques. When it comes to lie close to a tissue-specific enhancer, blue staining results in particular tissues of the fly. Many different patterns of expression have already been obtained with the long-term aim of cloning the nearby genes that these enhancers normally regulate. Whilst analysing a set of flies containing these P-lacZ inserts for sex-specific expression in the adult, a preference was noticed for insertion into regions of DNA generating expression of beta-galactosidase in the male gonad. Since the transposition events generating these flies occurs in the male germ-line, it seemed possible that there was preferential insertion of the element into DNA which was being transcribed. To test this, transpositions were generated of the same P-lacZ ry+ in both the male and female germ-lines. The results are compatible with the above hypothesis. This finding has important implications for the type of enhancers likely to be found by this method, and may also be relevant to those using P elements as mutagens in Drosophila and for the study of the mechanism of P transposition.",1990,M Bownes
Two rat homologues of Drosophila achaete-scute specifically expressed in neuronal precursors,2392153,10.1038/346858a0,"In vertebrates, the peripheral nervous system is embryologically derived from the neural crest. Although the earliest neural crest cells seem to be multipotent, the molecular mechanisms responsible for the restriction of these cells to different sublineages are not understood. We therefore searched for developmental control genes expressed in crest cells or their derivatives. One important class of regulatory molecules comprises proteins with common DNA-binding and dimerization domains, the basic helix-loop-helix (B-HLH) region. Members of this family include MyoD, a mammalian myogenic determination molecule, and proteins encoded by genes of the achaete-scute complex of Drosophila, which have an important role in neuronal determination. From a sympathetic neuronal precursor cell line derived from the neural crest we have now isolated two different mammalian genes that are homologous to genes of the achaete-scute complex. The sequence of the B-HLH-encoding region of these genes is more similar to that of the genes of the achaete-scute complex than it is to that of other, mammalian members of the B-HLH family.

Allatostatic regulation of juvenile hormone production in vitro by the ring gland of Drosophila melanogaster,2155838,10.1016/0303-7207(90)90188-e,"A factor(s) extracted from the third instar larval brains of the dipteran species Sarcophaga bullata and Drosophila melanogaster causes a dose-dependent reduction of juvenile hormone (JHB3) biosynthesis by isolated ring glands in vitro. In situ, this factor is presumably neuronally transmitted from the brain to ring gland. The allatostatic effect of the brain factor is reversible in vitro and may be overcome partially by the JHB3 precursor farnesoic acid. Agents which act to increase the intracellular levels of cAMP (3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (MIX), forskolin, 8-benzoyl cAMP) all caused the reduction of JHB3 synthesis in vitro in a reversible manner. The inhibitory effect of increased levels of cAMP was overcome by the addition of farnesoic acid to the culture medium. The dependence of JHB3 synthesis on extracellular calcium was demonstrated by incubation of ring glands in the presence of the Ca2+ channel blocker lanthanum chloride, and in Ca2(+)-free medium containing EGTA. The inclusion of farnesoic acid abolished the zero Ca2+ effect completely. However, the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 inhibited JHB3 production in medium containing Ca2+, suggesting that elevated intracellular levels of Ca2+ also suppress JHB3 production. This latter inhibition could not be reversed completely by farnesoic acid.",1990,"S W Applebaum, D S Richard, L I Gilbert"

Another of the transcripts appears to act in the cytoplasm, possibly monitoring or regulating some aspect of translation.

Chironomus was chosen because unlike Drosophila, its flight muscles develop during the last larval instar, before the lytic process of metamorphosis. Ten fibrillar DVM were shown to develop from a larval muscle associated with myoblasts. This muscle is connected to the imaginal leg disc so that its cavity communicates with the adepithelial cells present in the disc; but no migration of myoblasts seems to take place from the imaginal leg disc towards the larval muscle or vice versa. At the beginning of the last larval instar, the myoblasts were always present together with the nerves in the larval muscle. In addition, large larval muscle cells incorporated to the imaginal discs were observed to border on the area occupied by adepithelial cells, and are probably involved in the formation of 4 other fibrillar DVM with adepithelial cells. Three factors seem to determine the number of DVM fibres: the initial number of larval fibres in the Anlage, the fusions of myoblasts with these larval fibres and the number of motor axons in the Anlage.

Kinetic characterization of dihydrofolate reductase from Drosophila melanogaster,2124130,10.1139/o90-161,"The kinetic characteristics of a purified insect dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) have been described. The Km values for the substrate dihydrofolate and the cofactor NADPH have been estimated by primary and secondary Hanes plots to be 0.3 and 5.2 microM, respectively. Drosophila melanogaster DHFR can use folate and NADH at acidic pH values, but at a much lower rate than the preferred substrate and cofactor. Folic acid is a partial competitive inhibitor of Drosophila DHFR (Ki = 0.4 microM) and trimethoprim is a complete competitive inhibitor (Ki = 5.4 microM). Methotrexate binds less tightly to the Drosophila enzyme than to many other DHFRs (Kd = 0.9 nM). Drosophila DHFR is inhibited by KCl and organic mercurials and is slightly activated by urea. These data indicate that Drosophila DHFR has some characteristics which are typical of vertebrate DHFRs and others which are typical of prokaryotic DHFRs. The study of this enzyme, therefore, should aid in the definition of the structural features that are responsible for the kinetic characteristics in different DHFRs.",1990,"V K Walker, S L Rancourt"
Transcription elongation and eukaryotic gene regulation,2193290,,"Each step in the synthesis of functional transcript by RNA polymerase II provides a level at which gene expression can be regulated. Control over the elongation phase of transcription is a recognized regulatory mechanism in prokaryotes; however, only recently have examples of conditional transcription elongation blockage been reported in eukaryotic cellular genes. In several cases, control over transcription elongation clearly contributes to the regulated expression of these genes. Indeed, reports that transcription by RNA polymerase II is initiated and paused on many Drosophila promoters, prior to induction of gene expression, suggests that release of an arrested polymerase, as opposed to polymerase recruitment to a disengaged promoter, may be the key regulatory step for many genes thought to be controlled by transcription initiation (Rougvie & Lis, 1988). RNA polymerase II undergoes modifications, such as association with ancillary elongation factors and phosphorylation of its large subunit carboxy terminal domain (CTD), at stages subsequent to recruitment to a promoter and establishment of a pre-initiation complex (Reinberg & Roeder, 1987; Rappaport et al., 1987; Payne et al., 1989; Laybourn & Dahmus, 1989). It is possible that modifications such as these, or others occurring prior to, during or following transcription initiation, may alter the holoenzyme's transcription elongation properties, to allow recognition or read-through of elongation block signals within a transcription unit. In this review, we will present features of transcription elongation blockage in several eukaryotic cellular genes in the context of our understanding of attenuation and premature transcription termination in prokaryotic and viral genes. We will also present evidence supporting the model that modifications to the RNA polymerase II transcription complex are pivotal to the control of transcriptional at the level of elongation.",1990,"M Groudine, C A Spencer"
Analysis of cytoplasmic activity dependent on the Drosophila terminal pattern gene torso,2210039,10.1016/0012-1606(90)90386-w,"Cytoplasm from wildtype Drosophila embryos was transplanted into torso (tor) mutant embryos to determine the distribution of terminal rescuing activity at the cleavage stage. Although posterior and lateral wildtype cytoplasm contained rescuing activity that restored posterior terminal (telson) structures Klingler et al.

Similarly, transplantation of anterior and lateral wildtype cytoplasm into the anterior of tor embryos rescued anterior terminal (acron) structures, whereas posterior cytoplasm did not. This failure of reciprocal rescue is due to the presence of the products of the anterior and posterior classes of genes, because anterior cytoplasm from bicoid mutant embryos restored the telson in the posterior as well as the acron in the anterior of tor embryos, and because posterior cytoplasm from nanos embryos rescued the acron in the anterior as well as the telson in the posterior of tor embryos.

In adults, alpha 85E mRNA has been unequivocally identified only in testes. In the present study, isotype-specific antibodies have been used to localize alpha 85E tubulin protein in whole tissues. The results demonstrate a spatially restricted expression pattern of the alpha 85E gene that includes tissues of both ectodermal and mesodermal origins. Specifically, embryonic accumulation of alpha 85E tubulin is limited to support cells of chordotonal organs and the developing musculature of the viscera and body wall. In late third instar larvae, chordotonal organs and a subset of larval nerves, but not muscle, stain with anti-alpha 85E. The timing of protein accumulation during pupal development suggests that alpha 85E tubulin is involved in the construction of the adult as well as the larval musculature. In testis, only the somatically derived cyst cells that surround developing spermatid bundles accumulate alpha 85E-tubulin.

Functional domains and upstream activation properties of cloned human TATA binding protein,2363050,10.1126/science.2363050,"The TATA binding protein, TFIID, plays a central role in the initiation of eukaryotic mRNA synthesis. Here, we present a human cDNA clone for this factor. Comparison of its predicted protein sequence with those from Drosophila and yeast reveals a highly conserved carboxyl-terminal 180 amino acids. By contrast, the amino-terminal region of TFIID has diverged in both sequence and length. A striking feature of the human protein is a stretch of 38 glutamine residues in the NH2-terminal region. Expression of human TFIID in both Escherichia coli and HeLa cells produces a protein that binds specifically to a TATA box and promotes basal transcription; the conserved COOH-terminal portion of the protein is sufficient for both of these activities. Recombinant TFIID forms a stable complex on a TATA box either alone or in combination with either of the general transcription factors, TFIIA or TFIIB. Full-length recombinant TFIID is able to support Sp1 activated transcription in a TFIID-depleted nuclear extract, while a deletion of the NH2-terminal half of the protein is not. These results indicate the importance of the NH2-terminal region for upstream activation functions and suggest that additional factors (co-activators) are required for mediating interactions with specific regulators.",1990,"B F Pugh, R Tjian, N Tanese, M G Peterson"

Examination of embryos affected by the maternal effect of quartet has revealed defects that can be attributed to incomplete chromosome separation at mitosis. These defects include uneven spacing of nuclei, strands of DNA creating bridges between nuclei, and abnormal amounts of DNA per nucleus. Nuclei in quartet-affected embryos also have a greater-than-normal number of centrosomes. Immunofluorescent examination of the spindles in quartet-affected embryos has revealed tripolar spindles and adjacent spindles that share a common spindle pole. Finally, chromosome separation distance was measured in anaphase and telophase spindles in quartet-affected embryos and found to be blocked in anaphase. Examination of mitotic figures in quartet larvae revealed a reduced mitotic index and an elevated frequency of abnormal mitotic figures. quartet could encode a function necessary for the disengagement of chromosomes in mitosis, for kinetochore function or for function of a spindle motor.

A Drosophila simulans mutant strain sensitive to benzo[a]pyrene and 2-acetylaminofluorene,1378181,10.1016/0027-5107(92)90092-g,"We have identified a Drosophila simulans mutant, 364 yu, that is sensitive to the toxic effects of the procarcinogens B(a)P and 2-AAF. Heterozygotes obtained by crossing it to the wild resistant Turku strain (female 364 yu x male Turku) were more sensitive than heterozygotes obtained from the reciprocal cross (female Turku x male 364 yu) to both the toxic and the mutagenic effects of B(a)P in Drosophila tests that measured lethality and the induction of somatic mosaicism, respectively. The non-carcinogens pyrene, B(e)P and 4-AAF were only weakly toxic and non-mutagenic. In the Ames test B(a)P activation with S15 fractions prepared from the homogenates of Drosophila larvae and imagoes of the 364 yu strain, as well as of the more resistant D. melanogaster y ++/+ w sn3 heterozygotes, did not significantly increase the number of S. typhimurium TA100 revertants even following pretreatment with inducers of microsomal monooxygenases (B(a)P, PCB, PB). As for 2-AAF, a certain increase was observed following only PB, but not B(a)P pretreatment.

"Drosophila melanogaster paramyosin: developmental pattern, mapping and properties deduced from its complete coding sequence",1371577,10.1007/BF00292707,"Several cDNA clones encoding the complete Drosophila paramyosin sequence, including two potential polyadenylation sites, have been obtained. Southern analysis and in situ hybridization to polytene chromosomes indicate that in Drosophila the paramyosin gene is single copy, located on the left arm of the third chromosome at region 66D14. Northern analyses show predominantly two different RNAs which are the products of the choice between the two alternative polyadenylation sites. The two species begin to be synthesized around 10 h of development when embryonic muscles are formed, expression peaking at the end of embryogenesis. The protein is first expressed at germ band shortening in association with muscle precursor cells. A second maximum of paramyosin RNA expression occurs at late pupal stages when the higher molecular weight form becomes more abundant. In young adults this species becomes the main transcript detected. The 102 kDa polypeptide sequence is highly similar to that of Caenorhabditis elegans paramyosin. The protein has a central alpha-helical coiled-coil rod, organized in 29 groups of four typical seven-residue repeats and flanked by two short non-alpha-helical regions. Several leucine zippers are located on the hydrophobic face of the alpha-helix in paramyosin which, together with disulfide bonds between cysteines, are probably involved in the stabilization of the dimer. The structural and functional properties of Drosophila paramyosin deduced from the sequence are compared with those of known invertebrate myosins and paramyosins.",1992,"R Marco, R Garesse, M Maroto, J Vinós, M Cervera"
"A biochemical genetic study of alcohol dehydrogenase isozymes of the medfly, Ceratitis capitata Wied",1616483,10.1007/BF02396218,"A concerted effort is under way to analyze, at the genetic, biochemical, and molecular level, the Adh gene system in the medfly Ceratitis capitata, an important agricultural pest. The isoelectric focusing (IEF) pattern of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) of the medfly demonstrates the presence of two well-differentiated, genetically independent dimeric proteins, called ADH-1 and ADH-2. These proteins do not exhibit interlocus heterodimeric isozymes, and the genes are not controlled coordinately during development, Adh1 and Adh2 being expressed mainly in muscle or in fat body and ovary, respectively. From the intensity of the IEF isozyme patterns, primary alcohols are judged to be better substrates than secondary alcohols, in contrast with Drosophila melanogaster ADH, and ethanol is probably the most efficient substrate for both sets of isozymes. The isoelectric points of ADH-1 (pI = 5.4) and ADH-2 (pI = 8.6) are different from D. melanogaster ADH (pI = 7.6), but the medfly ADH-1 has a native molecular weight (approx. 58 kD) close to that of D. melanogaster. A population survey of samples both from laboratory strains and from wild geographically different populations showed that the Adh1 locus is more polymorphic than Adh2. The most variable populations are from Africa, the supposed source area of the species. Further, a case of selection at the Adh1 locus under laboratory conditions is reported. The hypothesis of Adh gene duplication and the degree of similarity between medfly and Drosophila ADH are also discussed.",1992,"A R Malacrida, G Gasperi, L Baruffi, A S Robinson"

Analysis of spliceosome assembly and the structure of a regulated intron in Drosophila in vitro splicing extracts,1333586,10.1093/nar/20.21.5719,"We characterize spliceosome assembly in Drosophila embryonic nuclear extracts. Further, we show that these extracts contain high levels of a 5' to 3' exoribonuclease activity allowing rapid, convenient protection mapping of 5' splice site and branchpoint sequences. We use this assay to show, for the first time, that a regulated arthropod intron uses a remote branchpoint strikingly similar in structure to those observed previously in regulated vertebrate introns. These results provide new evidence that both regulated and constitutive splicing are similar in detail in vertebrates and arthropods indicating that the powerful genetic systems for analysis of splicing regulation in Drosophila are likely to be directly informative for regulated splicing throughout metazoa. In addition, we report formation of a novel class of intron-dependent complexes. Behavior of these complexes indicates that they represent a mutually exclusive, kinetically competing pathway with spliceosome assembly. We propose that this competition represents the basis for a kinetic proofreading mechanism enhancing fidelity of intron recognition. We also discuss possible implications of this model for regulated splicing.",1992,"P M Bingham, D Spikes"

corkscrew encodes a putative protein tyrosine phosphatase that functions to transduce the terminal signal from the receptor tyrosine kinase torso,1638629,10.1016/0092-8674(92)90098-w,"We describe the characterization of the Drosophila gene, corkscrew (csw), which is maternally required for normal determination of cell fates at the termini of the embryo. Determination of terminal cell fates is mediated by a signal transduction pathway that involves a receptor tyrosine kinase, torso, a serine/threonine kinase, D-raf, and the transcription factors, tailless and huckebein. Double mutant and cellular analyses between csw, torso, D-raf, and tailless indicate that csw acts downstream of torso and in concert with D-raf to positively transduce the torso signal via tailless, to downstream terminal genes. The csw gene encodes a putative nonreceptor protein tyrosine phosphatase covalently linked to two N-terminal SH2 domains, which is similar to the mammalian PTP1C protein.",1992,"I Larsen, L A Perkins, N Perrimon"
Effect of casein kinase II-mediated phosphorylation on the catalytic cycle of topoisomerase II. Regulation of enzyme activity by enhancement of ATP hydrolysis,1328202,,"The catalytic activity of topoisomerase II is stimulated approximately 2-3-fold following phosphorylation by casein kinase II (Ackerman, P., Glover, C. V. C., and Osheroff, N. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 82, 3164-3168). In order to delineate the mechanism by which the activity of the enzyme is enhanced, the effects of casein kinase II-mediated phosphorylation on the individual steps of the catalytic cycle of Drosophila topoisomerase II were characterized. Phosphorylation did not affect reaction steps that preceded hydrolysis of the enzyme's high energy ATP cofactor. This included enzyme-DNA binding, pre-strand passage DNA cleavage/religation, the double-stranded DNA passage event, and post-strand passage DNA cleavage/religation. In contrast, the rate of topoisomerase II-mediated ATP hydrolysis was stimulated 2.7-fold following phosphorylation by casein kinase II. Since ATP hydrolysis is a prerequisite for enzyme turnover, it is concluded that phosphorylation modulates the overall catalytic activity of topoisomerase II by stimulating the enzyme's ATPase activity.",1992,"R F DeVore, A H Corbett, N Osheroff"
Preferential expression of one beta-tubulin gene during flagellate development in Physarum,1556551,10.1099/00221287-138-1-229,"The microbial eukaryote Physarum polycephalum displays several distinct cell types in its life cycle, including amoebae, flagellates and plasmodia. Despite its relative simplicity, Physarum has a tubulin gene family of complexity comparable to that of Drosophila. We have identified beta-tubulin cDNAs from Physarum that are derived from the betA beta-tubulin locus and encode beta 1A tubulin. We have also identified a partial cDNA for the unlinked betB beta-tubulin gene, which encodes beta 1B tubulin. The polypeptide sequences encoded by betA and betB show 99% identity, but the nucleotide sequences show only 85% identity, consistent with an ancient duplication of these genes. The betB gene is expressed in amoebae, flagellates and plasmodia, whereas betA is expressed only in amoebae and flagellates. During the amoeba-flagellate transition the level of betA transcript increases over 100-fold, while the level of betB transcript changes very little. Thus Physarum has a mechanism for regulating the level of discrete beta-tubulin transcripts differentially during flagellate development. A need for this differential regulation could account for the maintenance of the virtually isocoding betA and betB beta-tubulin genes.",1992,"E C Paul, W F Dove, D B Cunningham, G L Buchschacher Jr, T G Burland"

In situ hybridization to human telophase and Drosophila polytene chromosomes shows localization of the (GGAAT)n sequence to centromeric regions. Hyperchromicity studies indicate that the (GGAAT)n sequence exhibits unusual hydrogen bonding properties. The purine-rich strand alone has the same thermal stability as the duplex. Hyperchromicity studies of synthetic DNA variants indicate that all sequences with the composition (AATGN)n exhibit this unusual thermal stability. DNA-mobility-shift assays indicate that specific HeLa-cell nuclear proteins recognize this sequence with a relative affinity greater than 10(5).

Effects of deuterium oxide and temperature on heart rate in Drosophila melanogaster,1319433,10.1007/BF00357535,"A non-intrusive optical technique has been developed to monitor heartbeat in late third-instar Drosophila larvae. Heartbeat in this insect is an oscillation that is not temperature compensated. Deuterium oxide lengthens the period of a number of high and low frequency oscillators and clocks in a variety of organisms. To determine whether deuterium affects heart rate, flies were raised on proteated and deuterated media and their heartbeat was monitored at four temperatures ranging from 18 to 33 degrees C. The rate of heartbeat increased linearly with increasing temperature, and decreased with increasing concentrations of deuterium. There was a significant interaction between temperature and deuterium: the higher the concentration of deuterium oxide the less temperature-sensitive was the heart rate. Raising temperatures also increased the amount of ""noise"" in the rhythm: signal-to-noise ratio, which characterizes the amount of power in a rhythmic signal, decreased with increasing temperatures.

A comparative study of Drosophila phenylalanine hydroxylase with a natural and a synthetic tetrahydropterin as cofactor,1458831,10.1016/0305-0491(92)90370-7,"1. Phenylalanine hydroxylase activity has been analyzed in Drosophila melanogaster using as cofactors the natural tetrahydropteridine 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin (H4Bip) and the synthetic one 5,6-dimethyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropterin (H4Dmp). 2. The apparent Vmax and KM for substrate and cofactor showed that the enzyme has two times more affinity for the substrate when H4Bip is the cofactor in the reaction. Similarly to what was found with purified rat liver phenylalanine hydroxylase, H4Bip was the most effective cofactor, leading to 4-5 times more activity than that obtained with H4Dmp. 3. With the natural cofactor H4Bip, no activation of the enzyme with Phe was necessary (in contrast to mammalian phenylalanine hydroxylase), and this tetrahydropteridine inhibits phenylalanine hydroxylase activity when the enzyme is exposed to it before phenylalanine addition. With the synthetic H4Dmp, both types of preincubations led to an increase of phenylalanine hydroxylase activity. 4. The enzyme is highly unstable compared to mammalian phenylalanine hydroxylase, even at -20 degrees C. 5. Thorax and abdomen extracts caused significant inhibition of phenylalanine hydroxylase activity from third instar larvae or newborn adult head extracts, when assayed with the synthetic cofactor H4Dmp. This inhibition did not happen with H4Bip. The presence of the pteridine 7-xanthopterin in adult bodies was not the cause of this inhibition.",1992,"K B Jacobson, Y Bel, J Ferré"

No-bridge of Drosophila melanogaster: portrait of a structural brain mutant of the central complex,1460532,10.3109/01677069209083444,"The mutant no-bridge (nobKS49) has its name from a structural defect in the protocerebral bridge of the central complex. This rod-shaped neuropil in nobKS49 has a large gap at the sagittal midplane, with some of the missing material accumulated more laterally. Mutant nob flies have a reduced maximal and average walking speed. Leg coordination is disturbed during turning but not while walking straight. Motivation for walking is low and steps are small due to slow forward swinging of the legs. Flies spontaneously may pass into an autistic (and possibly spastic) state in which they can move their legs and even perform cleaning movements but do not walk or fly. They spontaneously recover if left undisturbed. Gynandromorph experiments place the focus of the walking defects into the head. Mutant flies have a reduced tendency to escape when mechanically stimulated. In a brightly lit arena they do not avoid a black square above the horizon and they are negatively phototactic. In tethered flight optomotor responses are normal but the amplitude of spontaneous torque modulations as well as the number of torque spikes are reduced. If a single black bar is slowly rotated around the fly, the normal response pattern is observed. It vanishes, however, at moderately fast angular velocity at which the wild type still is fully responsible. The behavioral defects support the notion that the protocerebral bridge is part of a higher center for the regulation of behavior.",1992,"M Heisenberg, M Kinkelin, R Wolf, R Strauss, U Hanesch"

To get a better understanding of the turn-over of mitochondrial RNAs in vivo, we manipulated the mitochondrial mRNA degrading complex in Drosophila melanogaster models and studied the molecular consequences. Additionally, we investigated if and how these factors interact with the mitochondrial poly(A) polymerase, MTPAP, as well as with the mitochondrial mRNA stabilising factor, LRPPRC. Our results demonstrate a tight interdependency of mitochondrial mRNA stability, polyadenylation and the removal of antisense RNA. Furthermore, disruption of degradation, as well as polyadenylation, leads to the accumulation of double-stranded RNAs, and their escape out into the cytoplasm is associated with an altered immune-response in flies.

Gene expression correlates of facultative predation in the blow fly Chrysomya rufifacies (Diptera: Calliphoridae),31410272,10.1002/ece3.5413,"Effects of intraguild predation (IGP) on omnivores and detritivores are relatively understudied when compared to work on predator guilds. Functional genetic work in IGP is even more limited, but its application can help answer a range of questions related to ultimate and proximate causes of this behavior. Here, we integrate behavioral assays and transcriptomic analysis of facultative predation in a blow fly (Diptera: Calliphoridae) to evaluate the prevalence, effect, and correlated gene expression of facultative predation by the invasive species Chrysomya rufifacies. Field work observing donated human cadavers indicated facultative predation by C. rufifacies on the native blow fly Cochliomyia macellaria was rare under undisturbed conditions, owing in part to spatial segregation between species. Laboratory assays under conditions of starvation showed predation had a direct fitness benefit (i.e., survival) to the predator. As a genome is not available for C. rufifacies, a de novo transcriptome was developed and annotated using sequence similarity to Drosophila melanogaster. Under a variety of assembly parameters, several genes were identified as being differentially expressed between predators and nonpredators of this species, including genes involved in cell-to-cell signaling, osmotic regulation, starvation responses, and dopamine regulation.

A ribosomal protein S5 isoform is essential for oogenesis and interacts with distinct RNAs in Drosophila melanogaster,31551467,10.1038/s41598-019-50357-z,"In Drosophila melanogaster there are two genes encoding ribosomal protein S5, RpS5a and RpS5b.

Females lacking germline RpS5a are fully fertile, but germline expression of interfering RNA targeting germline RpS5a in an RpS5b mutant background worsened the RpS5b phenotype and blocked oogenesis before egg chambers form. A broad spectrum of mRNAs co-purified in immunoprecipitations with RpS5a, while RpS5b-associated mRNAs were specifically enriched for GO terms related to mitochondrial electron transport and cellular metabolic processes. Consistent with this, RpS5b mitochondrial fractions are depleted for proteins linked to oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial respiration, and RpS5b mitochondria tended to form large clusters and had more heterogeneous morphology than those from controls.

The two best studied stress assemblies are the RNA-based processing-bodies (P-bodies) and stress granules that form in response to oxidative, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), osmotic and nutrient stress as well as many others. Interestingly, P-bodies and stress granules are heterogeneous with respect to both the pathways that lead to their formation and their protein and RNA content. Furthermore, in yeast and Drosophila, nutrient stress also leads to the formation of many other types of prosurvival cytoplasmic stress assemblies, such as metabolic enzymes foci, proteasome storage granules, EIF2B bodies, U-bodies and Sec bodies, some of which are not RNA-based.

We were especially interested in understanding host use evolution in these species. In order to infer a phylogenetic hypothesis for this group we sampled loci from both the nuclear genome and the mitochondrial DNA to develop a dataset of 43 protein-coding loci for these two groups along with their close relatives in the immigrans-tripunctata radiation. We used this dataset to examine their evolutionary relationships along with the evolution of feeding behavior. Our analysis recovers strong support for the monophyly of the testacea but not the quinaria group. Results from our ancestral state reconstruction analysis suggests that the ancestor of the testacea and quinaria groups exhibited mushroom-feeding.

Altered Notch Signaling in Developing Molar Teeth of Pituitary Adenylate Cyclase-Activating Polypeptide (PACAP)-Deficient Mice,30094580,10.1007/s12031-018-1146-7,"Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) is a neuropeptide with neuroprotective and neurotrophic effects. This suggests its influence on the development of teeth, which are, similarly to the nervous system, ectoderm and neural crest derivatives. Our earlier studies have shown morphological differences between wild-type (WT) and PACAP-deficient mice, with upregulated sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling in the lack of PACAP. Notch signaling is a key element of proper tooth development by regulating apoptosis and cell proliferation. In this study, our main goal was to evaluate the possible effects of PACAP on Notch signaling pathway. Immunohistochemical staining was performed of Notch receptors (Notch1, 2, 3, 4), their ligands [delta-like protein (DLL)1, 3, 4, Jagged1, 2], and intracellular target molecules [CSL (CBF1 humans/Su (H) Drosophila/LAG1 Caenorhabditis elegans transcription factor); TACE (TNF-α converting enzyme), NUMB] in molar teeth of 5-day-old WT, and homozygous and heterozygous PACAP-deficient mice. We measured immunopositivity in the enamel-producing ameloblasts and dentin-producing odontoblasts. Notch2 receptor and DLL1 expression were elevated in ameloblasts of PACAP-deficient mice compared to those in WT ones. The expression of CSL showed similar results both in the ameloblasts and odontoblasts. Jagged1 ligand expression was elevated in the odontoblasts of homozygous PACAP-deficient mice compared to WT mice. Other Notch pathway elements did not show significant differences between the genotype groups. The lack of PACAP leads to upregulation of Notch pathway elements in the odontoblast and ameloblast cells. The underlying molecular mechanisms are yet to be elucidated; however, we propose SHH-dependent and independent processes. We hypothesize that this compensatory upregulation of Notch signaling by the lack of PACAP could represent a salvage pathway in PACAP-deficient animals.",2019,"H Hashimoto, B Sandor, R Zakany, E Karanyicz, B Gaszner, B D Fulop, D Reglodi, T Juhasz, A Tamas, E Szentleleky"

While RNA binding by these tandem domains is transient, all four dsRBDs recognize their target RNAs with high stability. Rescue experiments in Drosophila oocytes demonstrate that mStau2 partially rescues dmStau-dependent mRNA localization. In contrast, a rescue with mStau2 bearing RNA-binding mutations in dsRBD1-2 fails, confirming the physiological relevance of our findings.

Effect of Light Exposure upon Food Consumption and Brain Size in Dark-Flies (Drosophila melanogaster),31770768,10.1159/000504121,"While reducing the investment in the visual system of nocturnal/cave-dwelling species appears to be an evolutionarily stable strategy in response to the difficulty of locating food in the dark, relying on visual information for diurnal species is crucial for their survival and reproduction.

In particular, if life in the dark is associated with a reduction in energetic demand, would relocation to a well-lit environment increase energetic demand? This question has a bearing upon our understanding of factors that influence the ability of species to adapt to new habitats. After observing that a sub-population of ""Dark-flies"" (i.e., fruit flies bred in the dark for more than 60 years) has been selected with a larger visual system (optic lobes) and brain over the course of being maintained in normal lighting conditions for 3 years (DFLight), we used the CAFÉ assay method to investigate the differences in the two strains' energetic demands in the present study. We therefore measured brain size, body size, and food consumption in Dark-flies, DFLight, and Oregon flies (i.e., the fly species most genetically similar to Dark-flies). We found that the DFLight consumed more food solution than the Dark-flies, which correlates with that strain's larger brain size and improved visual capability compared to the Dark-flies. In addition, and although the -Oregon flies initially consumed less food solution than the DFLight, the amount consumed by these two strains by the end of the CAFÉ assay was approximately the same. This suggests that the Dark-flies have adapted their metabolism or feeding strategies in response to a dark environment. Our investigation therefore provides empirical evidence elucidating the manner in which energetic demands change in response to environmental changes and the cross-generational effect upon sensory-system investment.",2019,"Thomas Carle, Alban Guillet, Antonia Stergiou"

Neural stem cell dynamics: the development of brain tumours,31330360,10.1016/j.ceb.2019.06.001,"Determining the premalignant lesions that develop into malignant tumours remains a daunting task. Brain tumours are frequently characterised by a block in differentiation, implying that normal developmental pathways become hijacked during tumourigenesis. However, the heterogeneity of stem cells and their progenitors in the brain suggests there are many potential routes to tumour initiation. Studies in Drosophila melanogaster have enhanced our understanding of the tumourigenic potential of distinct cell types in the brain.

LOVIT Is a Putative Vesicular Histamine Transporter Required in Drosophila for Vision,31042461,10.1016/j.celrep.2019.04.024,"Classical fast neurotransmitters are loaded into synaptic vesicles and concentrated by the action of a specific vesicular transporter before being released from the presynaptic neuron. In Drosophila, histamine is distributed mainly in photoreceptors, where it serves as the main neurotransmitter for visual input. In a targeted RNAi screen for neurotransmitter transporters involved in concentrating photoreceptor synaptic histamine, we identified an SLC45 transporter protein, LOVIT (loss of visual transmission). LOVIT is prominently expressed in photoreceptor synaptic vesicles and is required for Drosophila visual neurotransmission. Null mutations of lovit severely reduced the concentration of histamine in photoreceptor terminals. These results demonstrate a LOVIT-dependent mechanism, maintaining the synaptic concentration of histamine, and provide evidence for a histamine vesicular transporter besides the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT) family.",2019,"Ying Xu, Tao Wang"
Larvae of Drosophila melanogaster exhibit transcriptional activation of immune response pathways and antimicrobial peptides during recovery from supercooling stress,30660665,10.1016/j.ibmb.2019.01.006,"The biochemical and molecular mechanisms underlying insect cold acclimation prior to cold stress are relatively well explored, but the mechanisms linked to recovery and repair after cold stress have received much less attention. Here we focus on recovery from cold stress in the larvae of the vinegar fly (Drosophila melanogaster) that were exposed to two physiologically distinct cold stress situations: supercooling (S, survival > 95%) and freezing (F, survival < 10%), both at -5 °C. We analysed the metabolic and transcriptomic responses to cold stress via GC-MS/LC-MS and whole-genome microarrays, respectively. Both stresses (S and F) caused metabolic perturbations which were transient in supercooled larvae but deeper and irreversible in frozen larvae. Differential gene expression analysis revealed a clear disparity in responses to supercooling and freezing (less than 10% of DE genes overlapped between S and F larvae). Using GO term enrichment analysis and KEGG pathway mapping, we identified the stimulation of immune response pathways as a strong candidate mechanism for coping with supercooling. Supercooling caused complex transcriptional activation of innate immunity potential: from Lysozyme-mediated degradation of bacterial cell walls, recognition of pathogen signals, through phagocytosis and lysosomal degradation, Toll and Imd signaling, to upregulation of genes coding for different antimicrobial peptides. The transcriptomic response to freezing was instead dominated by degradation of macromolecules and death-related processes such as autophagy and apoptosis. Of the 45 upregulated DE genes overlapping in responses to supercooling and freezing, 26 were broadly ascribable to defense and repair functions.",2019,"Rodolphe Poupardin, Martin Moos, Tomáš Štětina, Petr Šimek, Petr Šmilauer, Vladimír Koštál"
Cellular labeling of endogenous retrovirus replication (CLEVR) reveals de novo insertions of the gypsy retrotransposable element in cell culture and in both neurons and glial cells of aging fruit flies,31095565,10.1371/journal.pbio.3000278,"Evidence is rapidly mounting that transposable element (TE) expression and replication may impact biology more widely than previously thought. This includes potential effects on normal physiology of somatic tissues and dysfunctional impacts in diseases associated with aging, such as cancer and neurodegeneration. Investigation of the biological impact of mobile elements in somatic cells will be greatly facilitated by the use of donor elements that are engineered to report de novo events in vivo. In multicellular organisms, reporter constructs demonstrating engineered long interspersed nuclear element (LINE-1; L1) mobilization have been in use for quite some time, and strategies similar to L1 retrotransposition reporter assays have been developed to report replication of Ty1 elements in yeast and mouse intracisternal A particle (IAP) long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons in cultivated cells. We describe a novel approach termed cellular labeling of endogenous retrovirus replication (CLEVR), which reports replication of the gypsy element within specific cells in vivo in Drosophila. The gypsy-CLEVR reporter reveals gypsy replication both in cell culture and in individual neurons and glial cells of the aging adult fly. We also demonstrate that the gypsy-CLEVR replication rate is increased when the short interfering RNA (siRNA) silencing system is genetically disrupted. This CLEVR strategy makes use of universally conserved features of retroviruses and should be widely applicable to other LTR retrotransposons, endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), and exogenous retroviruses.",2019,"Lisa Prazak, Yung-Heng Chang, Josh Dubnau, Richard M Keegan"
Mbt/PAK4 together with SRC modulates N-Cadherin adherens junctions in the developing Drosophila eye,30885947,10.1242/bio.038406,"Tissue morphogenesis is accompanied by changes of adherens junctions (AJ). During Drosophila eye development, AJ reorganization includes the formation of isolated N-Cadherin AJ between photoreceptors R3/R4. Little is known about how these N-Cadherin AJ are established and maintained. This study focuses on the kinases Mbt/PAK4 and SRC, both known to alter E-Cadherin AJ across phyla. Drosophila p21-activated kinase Mbt and the non-receptor tyrosine kinases Src64 and Src42 regulate proper N-Cadherin AJ. N-Cadherin AJ elongation depends on SRC kinase activity. Cell culture experiments demonstrate binding of both Drosophila SRC isoforms to N-Cadherin and its subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation. In contrast, Mbt stabilizes but does not bind N-Cadherin in vitro Mbt is required in R3/R4 for zipping the N-Cadherin AJ between these cells, independent of its kinase activity and Cdc42-binding. The mbt phenotype can be reverted by mutations in Src64 and Src42 Because Mbt neither directly binds to SRC proteins nor has a reproducible influence on their kinase activity, the conclusion is that Mbt and SRC signaling converge on N-Cadherin. N-Cadherin AJ formation during eye development requires a proper balance between the promoting effects of Mbt and the inhibiting influences of SRC kinases.",2019,Stephanie M Pütz
Stress-related hormones affect carbohydrate metabolism in Drosophila females,30793357,10.1002/arch.21540,"A highly conservative insulin signaling pathway, stable work of which is indicated by carbohydrates metabolism, is also known to play an important role in the control of stress resistance.

We have shown that the rise in juvenile hormone (JH) and dopamine decreases levels of both carbohydrates under the normal conditions but brings them to values close to normal following the stress exposure. The data obtained suggest that (a) dopamine and JH involved in the neuroendocrine stress reaction in D. melanogaster also take part in the regulation of carbohydrates metabolism, tending to normalize it after stress; (b) the regulation of trehalose content under stress does not occur at the level of transcription of the degrading enzyme.",2019,"Darya S Pirozhkova, Nataly E Gruntenko, Margarita A Eremina, Evgenia K Karpova"
Enabling cell-type-specific behavioral epigenetics in Drosophila: a modified high-yield INTACT method reveals the impact of social environment on the epigenetic landscape in dopaminergic neurons,30967153,10.1186/s12915-019-0646-4,"Background: Epigenetic mechanisms play fundamental roles in brain function and behavior and stressors such as social isolation can alter animal behavior via epigenetic mechanisms. However, due to cellular heterogeneity, identifying cell-type-specific epigenetic changes in the brain is challenging. Here, we report the first use of a modified isolation of nuclei tagged in specific cell type (INTACT) method in behavioral epigenetics of Drosophila melanogaster, a method we call mini-INTACT. Results: Using ChIP-seq on mini-INTACT purified dopaminergic nuclei, we identified epigenetic signatures in socially isolated and socially enriched Drosophila males. Social experience altered the epigenetic landscape in clusters of genes involved in transcription and neural function. Some of these alterations could be predicted by expression changes of four transcription factors and the prevalence of their binding sites in several clusters. These transcription factors were previously identified as activity-regulated genes, and their knockdown in dopaminergic neurons reduced the effects of social experience on sleep. Conclusions: Our work enables the use of Drosophila as a model for cell-type-specific behavioral epigenetics and establishes that social environment shifts the epigenetic landscape in dopaminergic neurons. Four activity-related transcription factors are required in dopaminergic neurons for the effects of social environment on sleep.",2019,"Pavan Agrawal, Clement Kent, Ulrike Heberlein, Phuong Chung"
Mechanism of Acetic Acid Gustatory Repulsion in Drosophila,30726729,10.1016/j.celrep.2019.01.042,"The decision to consume or reject a food based on the degree of acidity is critical for animal survival. However, the gustatory receptors that detect sour compounds and influence feeding behavior have been elusive. Here, using the fly, Drosophila melanogaster, we reveal that a member of the ionotropic receptor family, IR7a, is essential for rejecting foods laced with high levels of acetic acid. IR7a is dispensable for repulsion of other acidic compounds, indicating that the gustatory sensation of acids occurs through a repertoire rather than a single receptor. The fly's main taste organ, the labellum, is decorated with bristles that house dendrites of gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs). IR7a is expressed in a subset of bitter GRNs rather than GRNs dedicated to sour taste. Our findings indicate that flies taste acids through a repertoire of receptors, enabling them to discriminate foods on the basis of acid composition rather than just pH.",2019,"Jiun Sang, Craig Montell, Seeta Poudel, Youngseok Lee, Suman Rimal, Dhananjay Thakur"
A Distinct Visual Pathway Mediates High-Intensity Light Adaptation of the Circadian Clock in Drosophila,30606757,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1497-18.2018,"To provide organisms with a fitness advantage, circadian clocks have to react appropriately to changes in their environment. High-intensity (HI) light plays an essential role in the adaptation to hot summer days, which especially endanger insects of desiccation or prey visibility. Here, we show that solely increasing light intensity leads to an increased midday siesta in Drosophila behavior. Interestingly, this change is independent of the fly's circadian photoreceptor cryptochrome and is solely caused by a small visual organ, the Hofbauer-Buchner eyelets. Using receptor knock-downs, immunostaining, and recently developed calcium tools, we show that the eyelets activate key core clock neurons, namely the s-LNvs, at HI. This activation delays the decrease of PERIOD (PER) in the middle of the day and propagates to downstream target clock neurons that prolong the siesta. We show a new pathway for integrating light-intensity information into the clock network, suggesting new network properties and surprising parallels between Drosophila and the mammalian system.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The ability of animals to adapt to their ever-changing environment plays an important role in their fitness. A key player in this adaptation is the circadian clock. For animals to predict the changes of day and night, they must constantly monitor, detect and incorporate changes in the environment. The appropriate incorporation and reaction to high-intensity (HI) light is of special importance for insects because they might suffer from desiccation during hot summer days. We show here that different photoreceptors have specialized functions to integrate low-intensity, medium-intensity, or HI light into the circadian system in Drosophila These results show surprising parallels to mammalian mechanisms, which also use different photoreceptor subtypes to respond to different light intensities.",2019,"Michael Rosbash, Charlotte Helfrich-Förster, Matthias Schlichting, Pamela Menegazzi"
An essential role of the mouse synapse-associated protein Syap1 in circuits for spontaneous motor activity and rotarod balance,31118165,10.1242/bio.042366,"Synapse-associated protein 1 (Syap1) is the mammalian homologue of synapse-associated protein of 47 kDa (Sap47) in Drosophila Genetic deletion of Sap47 leads to deficiencies in short-term plasticity and associative memory processing in flies. In mice, Syap1 is prominently expressed in the nervous system, but its function is still unclear. We have generated Syap1 knockout mice and tested motor behaviour and memory. These mice are viable and fertile but display distinct deficiencies in motor behaviour. Locomotor activity specifically appears to be reduced in early phases when voluntary movement is initiated. On the rotarod, a more demanding motor test involving control by sensory feedback, Syap1-deficient mice dramatically fail to adapt to accelerated speed or to a change in rotation direction. Syap1 is highly expressed in cerebellar Purkinje cells and cerebellar nuclei. Thus, this distinct motor phenotype could be due to a so-far unknown function of Syap1 in cerebellar sensorimotor control. The observed motor defects are highly specific since other tests in the modified SHIRPA exam, as well as cognitive tasks like novel object recognition, Pavlovian fear conditioning, anxiety-like behaviour in open field dark-light transition and elevated plus maze do not appear to be affected in Syap1 knockout mice.",2019,"Robert Blum, Michael Sendtner, Dominique Schmitt, Thomas Rülicke, Erich Buchner, Cora R von Collenberg"
Experimental and Theoretical Evidence for Bidirectional Signaling via Core Planar Polarity Protein Complexes in Drosophila,31254741,10.1016/j.isci.2019.06.021,"In developing tissues, sheets of cells become planar polarized, enabling coordination of cell behaviors. It has been suggested that ""signaling"" of polarity information between cells may occur either bidirectionally or monodirectionally between the molecules Frizzled (Fz) and Van Gogh (Vang). Using computational modeling we find that both bidirectional and monodirectional signaling models reproduce known non-autonomous phenotypes derived from patches of mutant tissue of key molecules but predict different phenotypes from double mutant tissue, which have previously given conflicting experimental results. Furthermore, we re-examine experimental phenotypes in the Drosophila wing, concluding that signaling is most likely bidirectional. Our modeling suggests that bidirectional signaling can be mediated either indirectly via bidirectional feedbacks between asymmetric intercellular protein complexes or directly via different affinities for protein binding in intercellular complexes, suggesting future avenues for investigation. Our findings offer insight into mechanisms of juxtacrine cell signaling and how tissue-scale properties emerge from individual cell behaviors.",2019,"Katherine H Fisher, David Strutt, Alexander G Fletcher"

Mutations in the beta-propeller domain of the Drosophila brain tumor (brat) protein induce neoplasm in the larval brain,10949924,10.1038/sj.onc.1203706,"Inactivation of both alleles of the fruit fly D. melanogaster brain tumor (brat) gene results in the production of a tumor-like neoplasm in the larval brain, and lethality in the larval third instar and pupal stages. We cloned the brat gene from a transposon-tagged allele and identified its gene product. brat encodes for an 1037 amino acid protein with an N-terminal B-boxl zinc finger followed by a B-box2 zinc finger, a coiled-coil domain, and a C-terminal beta-propeller domain with six blades. All these motifs are known to mediate protein-protein interactions. Sequence analysis of four brat alleles revealed that all of them are mutated at the beta-propeller domain. The clustering of mutations in this domain strongly suggests that it has a crucial role in the normal function of Brat, and defines a novel protein motif involved in tumor suppression activity. The brat gene is expressed in the embryonic central and peripheral nervous systems including the embryonic brain. In third instar larva brat expression was detected in the larval central nervous system including the brain and the ventral ganglion, in two glands - the ring gland and the salivary gland, and in parts of the foregut - the gastric caecae and the proventriculus. A second brat-like gene was found in D. melanogaster, and homologs were identified in the nematode, mouse, rat, and human.

The mouse DDB2 cDNA, coding for DDB p48 subunit, was cloned and the partial genomic structure of DDB2 was obtained. A search of current databases revealed amino acid sequences of mouse and Drosophila predicted p127 homologues, but not of a Drosophila p48 homologue.

Non-Mendelian segregation of sex chromosomes in heterospecific Drosophila males,10655222,,"Interspecific hybrids and backcrossed organisms generally suffer from reduced viability and/or fertility.

Apparently these introgressed lines fail to suppress a normally silent meiotic drive system. Using molecular markers we mapped two regions of the Drosophila genome that appear to exhibit differences between D. simulans and D. sechellia in their regulation of sex chromosome segregation distortion.

The bovine Adx cAMP-responsive transcription sequence (CRS) has previously been found to contain two consensus GC boxes. By use of nuclear extracts from adrenocortical cells, Sp1 and Sp3 are shown here to bind to CRS. Mutations designed to enhance the identification of additional CRS binding proteins by reducing Sp protein binding showed the presence of an additional DNA-binding protein (Adx factor). Adx factor binding is inhibited by the zinc-chelating agent, 1,10-o-phenanthroline, suggesting it might be a zinc finger protein. By a fractionation/renaturation technique the Adx factor in mouse Y1 adrenocortical cells was found to be in the size range of 106-115 kDa by gel mobility shift assay. On the basis of size, the CRS sequence to which it binds, and its tentative identification as a zinc finger protein, Adx factor has been identified as a Krüppel-like zinc finger protein (a mouse ZBP-89 homologue). Further mutagenesis of CRS demonstrates that it can further be divided into two similar cAMP-responsive elements, and elimination of ZBP-89 binding does not affect cAMP responsiveness of either. Expression of these three nuclear proteins in Drosophila SL2 cells has been used to decipher the role of Adx CRS binding proteins in regulating transcription.

Failure of pronuclear migration and repeated divisions of polar body nuclei associated with MTOC defects in polo eggs of Drosophila,10954431,,"The meiotic spindle of Drosophila oocytes is acentriolar but develops an unusual central microtubule organising centre (MTOC) at the end of meiosis I. In polo oocytes, this common central pole for the two tandem spindles of meiosis II was poorly organised and in contrast to wild-type failed to maintain its associated Pav-KLP motor protein. Furthermore, the polar body nuclei failed to arrest at metaphase, and the four products of female meiosis all underwent repeated haploid division cycles on anastral spindles. This was linked to a failure to form the astral array of microtubules with which the polar body chromosomes are normally associated. The MTOC associated with the male pronucleus was also defective in polo eggs, and the sperm aster did not grow. Migration of the female pronucleus did not take place and so a gonomeric spindle could not form.

The proprotein convertases (PCs), a family of subtilisin-like proteases, are the major endoproteases that serve this function.

Multiple PC genes have also been cloned from a number of invertebrates, including Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans. These findings suggest that gene duplication and diversification of the PCs have occurred throughout metazoan evolution. To investigate the structural and functional changes which have occurred during vertebrate development, we have analyzed the expression of PC genes in the protochordate amphioxus. We have previously shown that amphioxus express homologous PC2 and PC1/PC3 genes [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 92 (1995) 3591]. Here we report the characterization of amphioxus cDNAs encoding proteases with a high degree of similarity to mammalian PC6. Three cDNAs encoding three PC6 isoforms differing only in their carboxy-terminal sequences were found, derived by alternative splicing. Two isoforms appear to be soluble enzymes, whereas the third contains a transmembrane hydrophobic segment and thus is likely to be membrane-bound. All three variants contain many repeats of a cysteine-rich motif that is found in several other PC family members. Thus, amphioxus, like the vertebrates, expresses two types of PCs, e.g., PC2 and PC1/PC3 which function in the regulated secretory pathway in neuroendocrine cells, and the more widely expressed PC6 which functions mainly in the constitutive pathway.",2000,"D F Steiner, A A Oliva Jr, S J Chan"
Restricted patterning of vestigial expression in Drosophila wing imaginal discs requires synergistic activation by both Mad and the drifter POU domain transcription factor,10862753,,"The Drosophila Vestigial protein has been shown to play an essential role in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation within the developing wing imaginal disc. Cell-specific expression of vg is controlled by two separate transcriptional enhancers. The boundary enhancer controls expression in cells near the dorsoventral (DV) boundary and is regulated by the Notch signal transduction pathway, while the quadrant enhancer responds to the Decapentaplegic and Wingless morphogen gradients emanating from cells near the anteroposterior (AP) and DV boundaries, respectively. MAD-dependent activation of the vestigial quadrant enhancer results in broad expression throughout the wing pouch but is excluded from cells near the DV boundary. This has previously been thought to be due to direct repression by a signal from the DV boundary; however, we show that this exclusion of quadrant enhancer-dependent expression from the DV boundary is due to the absence of an additional essential activator in those cells. The Drosophila POU domain transcriptional regulator, Drifter, is expressed in all cells within the wing pouch expressing a vgQ-lacZ transgene and is also excluded from the DV boundary. Viable drifter hypomorphic mutations cause defects in cell proliferation and wing vein patterning correlated with decreased quadrant enhancer-dependent expression. Drifter misexpression at the DV boundary using the GAL4/UAS system causes ectopic outgrowths at the distal wing tip due to induction of aberrant Vestigial expression, while a dominant-negative Drifter isoform represses expression of vgQ-lacZ and causes severe notching of the adult wing. In addition, we have identified an essential evolutionarily conserved sequence element bound by the Drifter protein with high affinity and located adjacent to the MAD binding site within the quadrant enhancer.

Data from mapping crosses of chromosome III support a role for a naturally occurring polymorphism in a multidrug resistance gene (Mdr65A) in alpha-amanitin resistance.

The fly caspases,11139276,10.1038/sj.cdd.4400756,"Caspases, a group of cysteine proteases, constitute the effector arm of the cell death machinery. There are seven caspases known in Drosophila, three of which contain long amino-terminal prodomains. Although, compared to mammalian caspases, much less is known about the biology of Drosophila caspases, many studies have shown that caspases are essential for programmed cell death in the fly and are likely to be regulated in ways similar to their mammalian counterparts. Studies on fly caspases have revealed some new insights on cell death regulation. For example, the transcript for the fly caspase DRONC is regulated by the hormone ecdysone during programmed cell death in specific tissues. Recent data on DRONC also suggest that some fly caspases may have unique substrate specificities not ascribed to mammalian caspases. The presence of multiple caspases in Drosophila indicates that apoptotic pathways in insects are likely to be as complex as in vertebrates.",2000,"S Kumar, J Doumanis"
Alternative splicing of Drosophila calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II regulates substrate specificity and activation,11039726,10.1016/s0169-328x(00)00115-7,"Drosophila calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II is alternatively spliced to generate multiple isoforms that vary only in a region between the calmodulin-binding domain and the association domain. This variation has been shown to modulate activation of the enzyme by calmodulin. In this study we examine the ability of seven of the Drosophila isoforms to phosphorylate purified protein substrates and to be inhibited by a substrate analog, and the response of six of the isoforms to a mutant form of calmodulin (V91G) that was isolated in a genetic screen. Significant variation in Kms for Eag, a potassium channel, and Adf-1, a transcription factor, were found. In the case of the a peptide inhibitor, AC3I, there were significant variations in Ki between isoforms. Kact for V91G calmodulin was increased for all of the isoforms. In addition, one isoform, RI, exhibited a lower Vmax when assayed with this mutant CaM. These results indicate that the variable domain of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II is capable of altering the substrate specificity of the catalytic domain and the activation response to calmodulin.",2000,"B GuptaRoy, K Beckingham, Z Wang, N Marwaha, H B Nelson, L C Griffith, M Pla"
brakeless is required for lamina targeting of R1-R6 axons in the Drosophila visual system,10804172,,"Photoreceptors in the Drosophila eye project their axons retinotopically to targets in the optic lobe of the brain. The axons of photoreceptor cells R1-R6 terminate in the first optic ganglion, the lamina, while R7 and R8 axons project through the lamina to terminate in distinct layers of the second ganglion, the medulla. Here we report the identification of the gene brakeless (bks) and show that its function is required in the developing eye specifically for the lamina targeting of R1-R6 axons. In mosaic animals lacking bks function in the eye, R1-R6 axons project through the lamina to terminate in the medulla. Other aspects of visual system development appear completely normal: photoreceptor and lamina cell fates are correctly specified, R7 axons correctly target the medulla, and both correctly targeted R7 axons and mistargeted R1-R6 axons maintain their retinotopic order with respect to both anteroposterior and dorsoventral axes. bks encodes two unusually hydrophilic nuclear protein isoforms, one of which contains a putative C(2)H(2) zinc finger domain. Transgenic expression of either Bks isoform is sufficient to restore the lamina targeting of R1-R6 axons in bks mosaics, but not to retarget R7 or R8 axons to the lamina. These data demonstrate the existence of a lamina-specific targeting mechanism for R1-R6 axons in the Drosophila visual system, and provide the first entry point in the molecular characterization of this process.",2000,"K Keleman, B J Dickson, K Senti, F Eisenhaber"
Nuclear import of cubitus interruptus is regulated by hedgehog via a mechanism distinct from Ci stabilization and Ci activation,10862750,,"The Hedgehog (Hh) signal is transduced via Cubitus interruptus (Ci) to specify cell fates in the Drosophila wing. In the absence of Hh, the 155 kDa full-length form of Ci is cleaved into a 75 kDa repressor. Hh inhibits the proteolysis of full-length Ci and facilitates its conversion into an activator. Recently, it has been suggested that Hh promotes Ci nuclear import in tissue culture cells. We have studied the mechanism of Ci nuclear import in vivo and the relationship between nuclear import, stabilization and activation. We found that Ci rapidly translocates to the nucleus in cells close to the anteroposterior (AP) boundary and this rapid nuclear import requires Hh signaling. The nuclear import of Ci is regulated by Hh even under conditions in which Ci is fully stabilized. Furthermore, cells that exhibit Ci stabilization and rapid nuclear import do not necessarily exhibit maximal Ci activity. It has been previously shown that stabilization does not suffice for activation. Consistent with this finding, our results suggest that the mechanisms regulating nuclear import, stabilization and activation are distinct from each other. Finally, we show that cos2 and pka, two molecules that have been characterized primarily as negative regulators of Ci activity, also have positive roles in the activation of Ci in response to Hh.",2000,"Q T Wang, R A Holmgren"
The transporter-like protein inebriated mediates hyperosmotic stimuli through intracellular signaling,11060215,,"We cloned the inebriated homologue MasIne from Manduca sexta and expressed it in Xenopus laevis oocytes. MasIne is homologous to neurotransmitter transporters but no transport was observed with a number of putative substrates. Oocytes expressing MasIne respond to hyperosmotic stimulation by releasing intracellular Ca(2+), as revealed by activation of the endogenous Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) current. This Ca(2+) release requires the N-terminal 108 amino acid residues of MasIne and occurs via the inositol trisphosphate pathway. Fusion of the N terminus to the rat gamma-aminobutyric acid transporter (rGAT1) also renders rGAT1 responsive to hyperosmotic stimulation. Immunohistochemical analyses show that MasIne and Drosophila Ine have similar tissue distribution patterns, suggesting functional identity. Inebriated is expressed in tissues and cells actively involved in K(+) transport, which suggests that it may have a role in ion transport, particularly of K(+). We propose that stimulation of MasIne releases intracellular Ca(2+) in native tissues, activating Ca(2+)-dependent K(+) channels, and leading to K(+) transport.",2000,"C Chiu, S S Gill, H A Lester, L S Ross, B N Cohen"
Dishevelled controls cell polarity during Xenopus gastrulation,10811222,10.1038/35011077,"Although cell movements are vital for establishing the normal architecture of embryos, it is unclear how these movements are regulated during development in vertebrates. Inhibition of Xenopus Dishevelled (Xdsh) function disrupts convergent extension movements of cells during gastrulation, but the mechanism of this effect is unclear, as cell fates are not affected. In Drosophila, Dishevelled controls both cell fate and cell polarity, but whether Dishevelled is involved in controlling cell polarity in vertebrate embryos has not been investigated. Here we show, using time-lapse confocal microscopy, that the failure of cells lacking Xdsh function to undergo convergent extension results from defects in cell polarity. Furthermore, Xdsh mutations that inhibit convergent extension correspond to mutations in Drosophila Dishevelled that selectively perturb planar cell polarity. Finally, the localization of Xdsh at the membrane of normal dorsal mesodermal cells is consistent with Xdsh controlling cell polarity. Our results show that polarized cell behaviour is essential for convergent extension and is controlled by vertebrate Dishevelled. Thus, a vertebrate equivalent of the Drosophila planar cell polarity signalling cascade may be required for normal gastrulation.",2000,"R M Harland, B A Rowning, J B Wallingford, U Rothbächer, K M Vogeli, S E Fraser"
Varied expression of a Y-linked P[w+] insert due to imprinting in Drosophila melanogaster,10791816,10.1139/g99-125,"During gametogenesis, a gene can become imprinted affecting its expression in progeny. We have used the expression of a Y-linked P[w+]YAL transposable DNA element as a reporter system to investigate the effect of parental origination on the expression of the w+ insert. Expression of w+ was greater in male progeny when the Y chromosome, harboring the insert, was inherited from the parental male rather than from the parental female. Imprinting was not due to a genetic background influence in the males, since the only difference among the males was the parental origin of the Y chromosome. It was also observed that the genetic background can affect imprinting, since w+ expression was also higher in males when the Y was derived from C(1)DX attached-X parental females rather than from C(1)RM attached-X parental females. Though the heterochromatic imprinting mechanism is unknown, a mutated Heterochromatin Protein 1 (HP1) gene, which is associated with suppression of position-effect variegation, increases expression of the w+ locus in the P[w+]YAL insert, indicating that HP1 may play a role in Y chromosome packaging.",2000,"B S Haller, R C Woodruff"

In larval and adult synchronous muscles, projectin is found localized over the A-band. Initial in vitro binding assays indicate interactions of several projectin regions with themselves and myosin heavy chain. These interactions might be critical for the assembly of projectin over the myosin filament during embryonic myofibrillogenesis and larval growth. On the other hand, projectin localizes over the I-Z-I region in indirect flight muscles. Correspondingly, projectin is found in association with forming Z-bands during pupation and colocalizes with alpha-actinin and kettin.",2000,"A Ayme-Southgate, M K McEliece, R Southgate"
Cellular basis of wing size variation in Drosophila melanogaster: a comparison of latitudinal clines on two continents,10762404,10.1046/j.1365-2540.2000.00677.x,"We investigated the cellular basis of two extensive, continuous, latitudinal, genetic, body size clines of Drosophila melanogaster by measuring wing area and cell size in the wing blade of adult flies reared under standard, laboratory conditions. We report that the contribution of cell size to an Australian cline is much smaller than that to a South American cline. The data suggest that neither cell size nor cell number were the targets of selection, but rather wing area itself, or a trait closely related to it. We hypothesize that the differences between the continents were caused by differences in the initial pattern of genetic variation for the cell traits and/or by the direction of selection on the source populations of the clines. Despite large differences between continents in the cellular basis of the latitudinal variation, multiple regression analysis, using the individual variation within populations, showed that the relationship between cell size and cell number was changed with latitude in the same way in the two clines. The relative contribution of cell number to wing area variation increased with latitude, probably because of compensatory interactions with cell size as a consequence of the latitudinal increase in cell number. Our findings are discussed in relation to the cellular basis of evolutionary change in laboratory thermal selection lines and natural populations along latitudinal clines.",2000,"B J Zwaan, L Partridge, R B Azevedo, J Van 't Land, A C James"
The isolation of two juvenile hormone-inducible genes in Drosophila melanogaster,10926782,10.1006/dbio.2000.9800,"Juvenile hormone (JH) is an important regulator of both insect development and reproductive maturation. Although the molecular mechanism of JH action is not yet known, there is growing circumstantial evidence that JH directly regulates gene expression. In the absence of a JH target gene, however, this suggestion has remained speculative. Cultured Drosophila S2 cells have been used to identify genes whose expression is regulated by JH. Employing differential display we identified several genes whose transcripts accumulate in cells treated with the JH agonist methoprene. Two of the genes-JhI-1 and JhI-26-were cloned and characterized in detail. For both genes, transcripts showed rapid and specific induction in the presence of either methoprene or JHIII, but not in the presence of other biologically inactive compounds of similar chemical structure. Accumulation of JhI-1 and JhI-26 RNAs requires continuous hormone presence. The developmental expression of the two JH-inducible genes corresponds to the abundance profile of JH in vivo. Furthermore, topical methoprene application to pupae leads to the ectopic accumulation of JhI-1 and JhI-26 transcripts.",2000,"A L Bilderback, V A Dubrovskaya, E B Dubrovsky, E M Berger"
Maternal expression and early zygotic regulation of the Hox3/zen gene in the grasshopper Schistocerca gregaria,11252555,10.1046/j.1525-142x.2000.00065.x,"In insects, a key step in the early patterning of the egg is to distinguish the primordium of the embryo proper from those regions that will form extra-embryonic membranes. In Drosophila, where these processes are well understood, the structure of the extra-embryonic membranes is highly derived. The distinct amnion and serosa typical of lower insects is replaced by a single, fused, and much reduced membrane, the amnioserosa, which never secretes an embryonic cuticle. We have used the Zen gene as a marker to study the formation of the extra-embryonic membranes, and other aspects of early embryonic patterning, in the grasshopper Schistocerca gregaria (African Plague Locust). Zen genes are derived from Hox genes, but in Drosophila they appear to have lost any role in patterning the A/P axis of the embryo; instead, they are involved in D/V patterning and the specification of the extra-embryonic membranes. We show that the Schistocerca zen gene is expressed during embryogenesis in three distinct phases. The first of these is during cleavage, when Sgzen is transiently expressed in all energids that reach the cell surface. The second phase of expression initiates in a ring of ""necklace cells"" that surround the forming embryo, and demarcate the boundary between the amnion and serosa. This leads to expression throughout the serosa. The final phase of expression is in the amnion, after this has separated from the serosa. This complex pattern implies that the role of Sgzen in Schistocerca is not limited solely to the specification of cell identity in the extra-embryonic membranes. We also report that the Schistocerca zen gene is expressed maternally, unlike its Drosophila and Tribolium counterparts. A distinct maternal transcript, and maternal Zen protein, accumulate in the developing oocyte from early post-meiotic stages. They remain uniformly distributed in the oocyte cytoplasm until late vitellogenic stages, when the protein and RNA become somewhat concentrated at the egg cortex and in the posterior polar cap of the oocyte, probably by passive exclusion from the yolk. The cytoplasmic localization of Sgzen protein in the oocyte, and at some stages during embryogenesis, implies that nuclear exclusion of this transcription factor is specifically controlled.",2000,"M Akam, F Falciani, P Dearden, M Grbic"
A TIMELESS-independent function for PERIOD proteins in the Drosophila clock,10839368,10.1016/s0896-6273(00)81182-4,"The mutation timeless(UL) generates 33 hr rhythms, prolonged nuclear localization of PERIOD/TIMELESS(UL) protein complexes, and protracted derepression of period (per) and timeless (tim) transcription. Light-induced elimination of TIM(UL) from nuclear PER/TIM(UL) complexes gives strong downregulation of per and tim expression. Thus, in the absence of TIM, nuclear PER can function as a potent negative transcriptional regulator. Two additional studies support this role for PER: (1) Drosophila expressing PER that constitutively localizes to nuclei produce dominant behavioral arrhythmicity, and (2) constitutively nuclear PER represses dCLOCK/CYCLE-mediated transcription of per in cultured cells without TIM. Conversion of PER/TIM heterodimers to nuclear PER proteins appears to be required to complete transcriptional repression and terminate each circadian molecular cycle.",2000,"M W Young, L Saez, A Rothenfluh"
The Drosophila melanogaster sex determination gene sisA is required in yolk nuclei for midgut formation,10790394,,"During sex determination, the sisterlessA (sisA) gene functions as one of four X:A numerator elements that set the alternative male or female regulatory states of the switch gene Sex-lethal. In somatic cells, sisA functions specifically in sex determination, but its expression pattern also hints at a role in the yolk cell, a syncytial structure believed to provide energy and nutrients to the developing embryo. Previous studies of sisA have been limited by the lack of a null allele, leaving open the possibility that sisA has additional functions. Here we report the isolation and molecular characterization of four new sisA alleles including two null mutations. Our findings highlight key aspects of sisA structure-function and reveal important qualitative differences between the effects of sisA and the other strong X:A numerator element, sisterlessB, on Sex-lethal expression. We use genetic, expression, clonal, and phenotypic analyses to demonstrate that sisA has an essential function in the yolk nuclei of both sexes. In the absence of sisA, endoderm migration and midgut formation are blocked, suggesting that the yolk cell may have a direct role in larval gut development.

These initiators in turn activate the core apoptotic machinery, including the caspases. Drosophila counterparts to other conserved components of the apoptotic machinery have been recently identified, and we discuss how these may be integrated into the process of normal developmentally regulated cell death.

IL-10 gene expression is controlled by the transcription factors Sp1 and Sp3,10861063,10.4049/jimmunol.165.1.286,"IL-10 is an 18-kDa cytokine with a key role in homeostatic control of inflammatory and immune responses. We have investigated how transcription of the IL-10 gene is regulated, so as to be able to understand the circumstances of IL-10 expression in both health and disease. In the mouse, IL-10 gene expression is regulated by a TATA-type promoter with a critical cis-acting element containing GGA repeats located at -89 to -77. Its complementary sequence is similar to the cis-acting elements (TCC repeats) in the promoters of genes encoding epidermal growth factor receptor and CD58. All these elements comprise a common CCTCCT sequence with less conserved C + T-rich sequences. Eliminating this CCTCCT sequence results in a marked reduction in promoter activity, suggesting a necessary role in IL-10 gene expression. Despite its dissimilarity to the G + C-rich Sp1 consensus sequence (GC box), Sp1 and Sp3 transcription factors could be shown to bind to this motif. The requirement for Sp1 and Sp3 in transcription of IL-10 was confirmed using Drosophila SL2 cells, which lack endogenous Sp factors.

Early genes required for salivary gland fate determination and morphogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster,11842931,10.1177/08959374000140011501,"Studies of Drosophila salivary gland formation have elucidated the regulatory pathway by which the salivary gland fate is determined and the morphogenetic processes by which the primordial cells are internalized to form the tubular glands. Both the position of the salivary primordia and the number of cells recruited to a salivary gland fate are established through a combination of the localized expression of the transcription factors SEX COMBS REDUCED (SCR), TEASHIRT (TSH) and ABDOMINAL-B (ABD-B), and localized DPP-signaling. Similarly, the distinction between the two major cell types, duct and secretory, is determined by spatially limited EGF-signaling. Salivary gland formation also requires the function of two transcription factors expressed in nearly all cells of the developing embryo, EXTRADENTICLE (EXD) and HOMOTHORAX (HTH). Once the salivary gland fate is determined, cells of the secretory primordia are internalized by an apical constriction mode of invagination. We have characterized three genes encoding transcription factors, trachealess (trh), hückebein (hkb), and fork head (fkh), that are downstream targets of the salivary gland regulators. Mutations in these transcription factors profoundly affect salivary gland morphogenesis. trh is required for the formation of the salivary duct tubes. hkb determines the order of secretory cell invagination, a regulated process critical for determining the final shape of the salivary gland. fkh has two early roles in salivary gland formation. fkh both promotes secretory cell survival and facilitates secretory cell internalization. trh, hkb, and fkh are involved in the formation of not only the salivary duct and secretory tubes, but also of other tubular structures, such as the trachea and the gut endoderm. We propose that trh, hkb, and fkh may serve as ""morphogenetic cassettes"" responsible for forming tubular structures in a variety of tissues.",2000,"D J Andrew, M M Myat, D D Isaac"
Characterization of the primary photointermediates of Drosophila rhodopsin,11087361,10.1021/bi001135k,"Invertebrate opsins are unique among the visual pigments because the light-activated conformation, metarhodopsin, is stable following exposure to light in vivo. Recovery of the light-activated pigment to the dark conformation (or resting state) occurs either thermally or photochemically. There is no evidence to suggest that the chromophore becomes detached from the protein during any stage in the formation or recovery processes. Biochemical and structural studies of invertebrate opsins have been limited by the inability to express and purify rhodopsins for structure-function studies. In this study, we used Drosophila to produce an epitope-tagged opsin, Rh1-1D4, in quantities suitable for spectroscopic and photochemical characterization. When expressed in Drosophila, Rh1-1D4 is localized to the rhabdomere membranes, has the same spectral properties in vivo as wild-type Rh1, and activates the phototransduction cascade in a normal manner. Purified Rh1-1D4 visual pigment has an absorption maximum of the dark-adapted state of 474 nm, while the metarhodopsin absorption maximum is 572 nm. However, the metarhodopsin state is not stable as purified in dodecyl maltoside but decays with kinetics that require a double-exponential fit having lifetimes of 280 and 2700 s. We investigated the primary properties of the pigment at low temperature. At 70 K, the pigment undergoes a temperature-induced red shift to 486 nm. Upon illumination with 435 nm light, a photostationary state mixture is formed consisting of bathorhodopsin (lambda(max) = 545 nm) and isorhodopsin (lambda(max) = 462 nm). We also compared the spectroscopic and photochemical properties of this pigment with other vertebrate pigments. We conclude that the binding site of Drosophila rhodopsin is similar to that of bovine rhodopsin and is characterized by a protonated Schiff base chromophore stabilized via a single negatively charged counterion.",2000,"L V Chadwell, S G Britt, R R Birge, B W Vought, E Salcedo, B E Knox"
Head versus trunk patterning in the Drosophila embryo; collier requirement for formation of the intercalary segment,10477305,,"Whereas the segmental nature of the insect head is well established, relatively little is known about the genetic and molecular mechanisms governing this process. In this paper, we report the phenotypic analysis of mutations in collier (col), which encodes the Drosophila member of the COE family of HLH transcription factors and is activated at the blastoderm stage in a region overlapping a parasegment (PS0: posterior intercalary and anterior mandibular segments) and a mitotic domain, MD2. col mutant embryos specifically lack intercalary ectodermal structures. col activity is required for intercalary-segment expression both of the segment polarity genes hedgehog, engrailed, and wingless, and of the segment identity gene cap and collar. The parasegmental register of col activation is controlled by the combined activities of the head-gap genes buttonhead and empty spiracles and the pair-rule gene even skipped; it therefore integrates inputs from both the head and trunk segmentation systems, which were previously considered as being essentially independent. After gastrulation, positive autoregulation of col is limited to cells of anterior PS0. Conversely, heat-pulse induced ubiquitous expression of Col leads to disruption of the head skeleton. Together, these results indicate that col is required for establishment of the PS(-1)/PS0 parasegmental border and formation of the intercalary segment. Our data support neither a simple combinatorial model for segmental patterning of the head nor a direct activation of segment polarity gene expression by head-gap genes, but rather argue for the existence of parasegment-specific second order regulators acting in the head, at a level similar to that of pair-rule genes in the trunk.",1999,"M Crozatier, L Dubois, D Valle, A Vincent, S Ibnsouda"

In this paper, we show that phenotypes of su(f) temperature-sensitive mutants result from a defect in cell proliferation. Analysis of the mitotic phenotype of su(f) temperature-sensitive alleles in larval brain and in imaginal discs reveals an increase in the number of metaphases with overcondensed chromosomes and asymmetric or reduced mitotic spindles. In contrast, neural differentiation in eye imaginal discs of the same mutant flies does not appear to be affected. These results indicate that su(f) is required during cell division for progression through metaphase. Taken together, these data suggest that a decrease in su(f) activity preferentially affects 3'-end formation of particular mRNAs, some of which are involved in mitosis, and are in agreement with a role of su(f) in the regulation of poly(A) site utilization.",1999,"A Audibert, M Simonelig"

Some of these proteins depend on INAD for proper subcellular localization to the phototransducing organelle, the rhabdomere, making it difficult to assess any physiological function of this signaling complex independent of localization. Here we demonstrated that INAD bound directly to the NINAC myosin III, yet the subcellular localization of NINAC was normal in inaD mutants. Nevertheless, the INAD binding site was sufficient to target a heterologous protein to the rhabdomeres. Disruption of the NINAC/INAD interaction delayed termination of the photoreceptor response.

Conversely, these responses were induced by ectopic expression of NO synthase. Perturbing components of the NO/cGMP pathway altered both tracheal development and survival during prolonged hypoxia.

Cell division genes promote asymmetric interaction between Numb and Notch in the Drosophila CNS,10331986,,"Cell intrinsic and cell extrinsic factors mediate asymmetric cell divisions during neurogenesis in the Drosophila embryo. In the NB4-2->GMC-1->RP2/sib lineage, one of the well-studied neuronal lineages in the ventral nerve cord, the Notch (N) signaling interacts with the asymmetrically localized Numb (Nb) to specify sibling neuronal fates to daughter cells of GMC-1. In this current study, we have investigated asymmetric cell fate specifications by N and Nb in the context of cell cycle. We have used loss-of-function mutations in N and nb, cell division mutants cyclinA (cycA), regulator of cyclin A1 (rca1) and string/cdc25 phosphatase (stg), and the microtubule destabilizing agent, nocodazole, to investigate this issue. We report that the loss of cycA, rca1 or stg leads to a block in the division of GMC-1, however, this GMC-1 exclusively adopts an RP2 identity. While the loss of N leads to the specification of RP2 fates to both progeny of GMC-1 and loss of nb results in the specification of sib fates to these daughter cells, the GMC-1 in the double mutant between nb and cycA assumes a sib fate. These epistasis results indicate that both N and nb function downstream of cell division genes and that progression through cell cycle is required for the asymmetric localization of Nb. In the absence of entry to metaphase, the Nb protein prevents the N signaling from specifying sib fate to the RP2/sib precursor. These results are also consistent with our finding that the sib cell is specified as RP2 in N; nb double mutants. Finally, our results show that nocodazole-arrested GMC-1 in wild-type embryos randomly assumes either an RP2 fate or a sib fate. This suggests that microtubules are involved in mediating the antagonistic interaction between Nb and N during RP2 and sib fate specification.",1999,"K M Bhat, P Wai, B Truong"
"Specific isoforms of squid, a Drosophila hnRNP, perform distinct roles in Gurken localization during oogenesis",10197986,10.1101/gad.13.7.864,"Heterogeneous nuclear RNA-binding proteins, hnRNPs, have been implicated in nuclear export of mRNAs in organisms from yeast to humans. A germ-line mutation in a Drosophila hnRNP, Squid (Sqd)/hrp40, causes female sterility as a result of mislocalization of gurken (grk) mRNA during oogenesis. Alternative splicing produces three isoforms, SqdA, SqdB, and SqdS. Here we show that these isoforms are not equivalent; SqdA and SqdS perform overlapping but nonidentical functions in grk mRNA localization and protein accumulation, whereas SqdB cannot perform these functions. Furthermore, although all three Sqd isoforms are expressed in the germline cells of the ovary, they display distinct intracellular distributions. Both SqdB and SqdS are detected in germ-line nuclei, whereas SqdA is predominantly cytoplasmic. We show that this differential nuclear accumulation is correlated with a differential association with the nuclear import protein Transportin. Finally, we provide evidence that grk mRNA localization and translation are coupled by an interaction between Sqd and the translational repressor protein Bruno. These results demonstrate the isoform-specific contributions of individual hnRNP proteins in the regulation of a specific mRNA. Moreover, these data suggest a novel role for hnRNPs in localization and translational regulation of mRNAs.",1999,"A Norvell, T Schüpbach, R L Kelley, K Wehr"
NTP Toxicology and Carcinogenesis Studies of Triethanolamine (CAS No. 102-71-6) in F344 Rats and B6C3F1 Mice (Dermal Studies),12594526,,"Triethanolamine is widely used as an ingredient in emulsifiers, thickeners, wetting agents, detergents, and alkalinizing agents in cosmetic products; as a chemical intermediate for anionic and nonionic surfactants and surface active agents in household cleaning agents, textiles, herbicides, pharmaceutical ointments, and other products; as a vulcanization accelerator in the manufacture of rubber; and in many other industrial applications. The National Cancer Institute nominated triethanolamine for study because of its widespread use in cosmetics and other consumer products, its high potential for worker exposure due to its many industrial uses, and its potential for conversion to the carcinogen N -nitrosodiethanolamine. Dermal application was chosen as the route of exposure to mimic the principal means of human exposure to triethanolamine and because considerable systemic exposure is achieved with this route. Male and female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice received triethanol amine (purity 98% or greater) by dermal application for 13 weeks or 2 years. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium, cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, Drosophila melano gaster, and mouse peripheral blood erythrocytes. 13-WEEK STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 10 male and 10 female rats were topically administered 0, 125, 250, 500, or 1,000 mg triethanolamine per kilogram body weight in acetone or 2,000 mg/kg neat triethanolamine, 5 days per week, for 13 weeks. All rats survived to the end of the study. Final mean body weights and weight gains of males and females administered 2,000 mg/kg and the mean body weight gain of females administered 1,000 mg/kg were significantly less than those of the vehicle controls. Clinical observations included irritation, scaliness, and crustiness of the skin at the site of application for males and females. Males also had discoloration, and two males administered 2,000 mg/kg had ulceration at the site of application. Changes in clinical pathology parameters were minor and consistent with inflammation at the site of application. Kidney weights were generally greater in males and females administered 500, 1,000, or 2,000 mg/kg than in the vehicle controls. Microscopic lesions attributed to triethanolamine administration included acanthosis and inflammation at the site of application, nephropathy in females, and hypertrophy of the pituitary gland pars intermedia in males and females. These lesions generally occurred with dose-related increases in incidence and severity in males and females. 13-WEEK STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 10 male and 10 female mice were topically administered 0, 250, 500, 1,000, or 2,000 mg triethanolamine per kilogram body weight in acetone or 4,000 mg/kg neat triethanolamine, 5 days per week, for 13 weeks. All mice survived to the end of the study. The final mean body weight and weight gain of males in the 250 mg/kg group were less than those of the vehicle controls. Clinical findings were observed only in mice in the 4,000 mg/kg groups and included scaliness, irritation, and discoloration at the site of triethanolamine application for males and females and skin erosion at this site in one male. The absolute kidney and liver weights of males and females administered 4,000 mg/kg were greater than those of the vehicle controls; relative kidney weights of males administered 1,000 mg/kg or greater and females in all dosed groups were also greater than those of the vehicle controls. Microscopic examination of the skin of dosed mice indicated acanthosis and inflammation at the site of application. Acanthosis occurred in all dosed groups and in one vehicle control female; the severity increased with increasing dose in males and females. Inflammation was observed in males and females in the 4,000 mg/kg groups and in one female in the 2,000 mg/kg group. 2-YEAR STUDY IN RATS: Based on the presence of acanthosis and inflammation at the site of application at the higher doses in the 13-week study, triethanolamine doses selected for the 2-year study in rats were 32, 63, and 125 mg/kg for malesr males and 63, 125, and 250 mg/kg for females. Groups of 60 male and 60 female rats were topically administered triethanolamine in acetone 5 days per week for 103 weeks. Ten male and ten female rats from each group were evaluated at 15 months for organ weights and histopathology. Survival, Body Weights, Clinical Findings, and Organ Weights: The survival rate of females in the 250 mg/kg group was slightly less than that of the vehicle controls. The mean body weight of females administered 250 mg/kg ranged from 9&percnt; to 12&percnt; less than that of the vehicle controls between weeks 73 and 93. Male and female rats receiving triethanolamine had irritated skin at the site of application; in dosed females, the site of application also had a crusty appearance. The number of animals in which these findings were observed increased with increasing dose. At the 15-month interim evaluation, the absolute left and right kidney weights and relative right kidney weight of females administered 250 mg/kg were significantly greater than those of the vehicle controls. Pathology Findings: The incidence of acanthosis at the site of application in males administered 125 mg/kg and the incidences of acanthosis, inflammation, and ulceration in dosed females were greater than in the vehicle controls at the 15-month interim evaluation and at the end of the 2-year study. Males in the 125 mg/kg group also had greater incidences of inflammation and ulceration than the vehicle controls, and females receiving 125 or 250 mg/kg had greater incidences of epidermal erosion than the vehicle controls at 2 years. There were no skin neoplasms at or away from the site of application that were considered related to treatment with triethanolamine. At the end of the study, renal tubule adenomas were observed in seven dosed males and in one vehicle control female and one female in the 63 mg/kg group. One male in the 125 mg/kg group and one female in the 250 mg/kg group had renal tubule hyperplasia. Extended (step-section) evaluation of the kidneys of all male rats revealed additional renal tubule adenomas in one vehicle control male, one male in the 32 mg/kg group, two males in the 63 mg/kg group, and three males in the 125 mg/kg group (including one male from the 15-month interim evaluation). An oncocytoma was also identified in one male in the 32 mg/kg group. Hyperplasia was identified in eight additional vehicle control males and in 19 additional dosed males. The total incidences (combined standard and extended evaluations) of renal tubule adenoma in dosed male rats were slightly greater than the vehicle control incidence (vehicle control, 1/50; 32 mg/kg, 2/50; 63 mg/kg, 6/49; 125 mg/kg, 4/50). The total incidence of hyperplasia in dosed and vehicle control males was similar (9/50, 8/50, 7/49, 6/50). The severity of hyperplasia in males in the 32 and 125 mg/kg groups was greater than that in the vehicle controls. 2-YEAR STUDY IN MICE: Based on dose-related inflammation at the site of application in the 13-week study, triethanolamine doses selected for the 2-year study in mice were 200, 630, and 2,000 mg/kg for males and 100, 300, and 1,000 mg/kg for females. Groups of 60 male and 60 female mice were topically administered triethanolamine in acetone 5 days per week for 103 weeks. Ten male and ten female mice from each group were evaluated at 15 months for organ weights and histopathology. Survival, Body Weights, Clinical Findings, and Organ Weights: Survival rates of all dosed groups of males and females were similar to those of the vehicle controls. The mean body weight of males administered 2,000 mg/kg ranged from 8&percnt; to 10&percnt; less than that of the vehicle controls from week 69 through the end of the study. Clinical findings included irritation and discoloration of the skin at the site of application for most males in the 2,000 mg/kg group and a few females in the 1,000 mg/kg group; males administered 200 or 630 mg/kg also had skin irritation. At the 15-month interim evaluation, the right kidney weights of male mice that received 630 or 2,000 mg/kg and the left kidney weights of males that received 2,000 mg/kg were significantly greater than those of the vehicle controls. Pathology Findings: Acanthosis and inflammation of the skin were observed at the site of application in male and female mice at the 15-month interim evaluation and at the end of the 2-year study. In males in the 2,000 mg/kg group, the incidences of both lesions were significantly greater than those in the vehicle controls at both time points; however, the severities of acanthosis and inflammation did not increase with dose. At the end of the study, the incidence of inflammation in females in the 1,000 mg/kg group was significantly greater than that in the vehicle controls. One vehicle control male and two males in each of the 630 and 2,000 mg/kg groups had ulcers at the site of application. At the 15-month interim evaluation, hepatocellular carcinomas were observed in dosed and vehicle control males and hepatocellular adenomas in dosed and vehicle control males and females; however, the incidences were not dose related. Nonneoplastic lesions observed at 15 months included foci of cellular alteration in a few dosed males and females; eosinophilic foci were also observed in two vehicle control females. At the end of the 2-year study, females in the 1,000 mg/kg group had significantly greater incidences of hepatocellular adenoma and multiple adenomas and a greater combined incidence of hepatocellular adenoma and carcinoma than the vehicle controls (adenoma: vehicle control, 22/50; 100 mg/kg, 22/50; 300 mg/kg, 24/50; 1,000 mg/kg, 40/50; multiple adenomas: 11/50, 9/50, 13/50, 29/50; combined adenoma and carcinoma: 23/50, 26/50, 28/50, 41/50). Females in the 300 mg/kg group had significantly greater incidences of hepatocellular carcinoma (1/50, 4/50, 7/50, 5/50) and eosinophilic foci (9/50, 10/50, 18/50, 16/50) than the vehicle controls. Incidences of hepatocellular adenoma and multiple adenomas in males in the 2,000 mg/kg group were significantly greater than those in the vehicle controls (adenoma: vehicle control, 27/50; 200 mg/kg, 27/50; 630 mg/kg, 29/50; 2,000 mg/kg, 37/50; multiple adenomas: 17/50, 18/50, 17/50, 29/50). Three males in the 2,000 mg/kg group had hepatoblastomas, and males in this group also had significantly greater incidences of hepatocellular neoplasms (combined) (adenoma, carcinoma, and hepatoblastoma: 31/50, 34/50, 33/50, 42/50) and eosinophilic foci (10/50, 17/50, 11/50, 23/50) than the vehicle controls. Male mice had a pattern of nonneoplastic liver lesions along with silver-staining helical organisms within the liver which suggested an infection with Helicobacter hepaticus. With polymerase chain reaction-based assays and culture, the presence of an organism compatible with H. hepaticus was confirmed. An increased incidence of hepatocellular neoplasms in male mice has been shown to be associated with H. hepaticus infection when hepatitis is also present. Therefore, interpretation of the increased incidence of hepatocellular neoplasms in mice was confounded. GENETIC TOXICOLOGY: Triethanolamine was not mutagenic in any of the in vitro or in vivo short-term tests performed by the NTP. It did not induce mutations in Salmonella typhimurium, and no induction of sister chromatid exchanges or chromosomal aberrations in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells exposed to triethanolamine was noted. These in vitro tests were conducted with and without S9 metabolic activation. Triethanolamine did not induce sex-linked recessive lethal mutations in germ cells of adult male Drosophila melanogaster exposed by feeding or injection. No increase in the frequency of micronucleated erythrocytes was observed in peripheral blood samples of male and female mice that received dermal applications of triethanolamine for 13 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of these dermal studies, there was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of triethanolamine in male F344/N rats based on a marginal increase in the incidence of renal tubule cell adenoma. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity in female F344/N rats receiving 63, 125, or 250 mg triethanolamine per kilogram body weight. The study in male and female B6C3F1 mice was considered inadequate, because the presence of a Helicobacter hepaticus infection complicated inter pretation of the relationship between triethanolamine administration and liver neoplasms in these animals. Dosed rats and mice had varying degrees of acanthosis and inflammation, dosed rats had ulceration, and dosed female rats had epidermal erosion at the site of skin application.

"SMRTER, a Drosophila nuclear receptor coregulator, reveals that EcR-mediated repression is critical for development",10488333,10.1016/s1097-2765(00)80365-2,"The Drosophila ecdysone receptor (EcR)/ultraspiracle (USP) heterodimer is a key regulator in molting and metamorphoric processes, activating and repressing transcription in a sequence-specific manner. Here, we report the isolation of an EcR-interacting protein, SMRTER, which is structurally divergent but functionally similar to the vertebrate nuclear corepressors SMRT and N-CoR. SMRTER mediates repression by interacting with Sin3A, a repressor known to form a complex with the histone deacetylase Rpd3/HDAC. Importantly, we identify an EcR mutant allele that fails to bind SMRTER and is characterized by developmental defects and lethality. Together, these results reveal a novel nuclear receptor cofactor that exhibits evolutionary conservation in the mechanism to achieve repression and demonstrate the essential role of repression in hormone signaling.",1999,"T P Yao, H Y Kao, C C Tsai, M McKeown, R M Evans"
Constitutive activation of toll-mediated antifungal defense in serpin-deficient Drosophila,10489372,10.1126/science.285.5435.1917,"The antifungal defense of Drosophila is controlled by the spaetzle/Toll/cactus gene cassette. Here, a loss-of-function mutation in the gene encoding a blood serine protease inhibitor, Spn43Ac, was shown to lead to constitutive expression of the antifungal peptide drosomycin, and this effect was mediated by the spaetzle and Toll gene products. Spaetzle was cleaved by proteolytic enzymes to its active ligand form shortly after immune challenge, and cleaved Spaetzle was constitutively present in Spn43Ac-deficient flies. Hence, Spn43Ac negatively regulates the Toll signaling pathway, and Toll does not function as a pattern recognition receptor in the Drosophila host defense.",1999,"D Gubb, J M Reichhart, E A Levashina, J A Hoffmann, C Green, E Langley, M Ashburner"
Aging: is oxidative stress a marker or is it causal?,10601888,10.1046/j.1525-1373.1999.d01-146.x,"Rapid developments in free radical biology and molecular technology have permitted exploration of the free radical theory of aging. Oxidative stress has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of diseases. Studies have found evidence of oxidative damage to macromolecules (DNA, lipids, protein), and data in transgenic Drosophila melanogaster support the hypothesis that oxidative injury might directly cause the aging process. Additional links between oxidative stress and aging focus on mitochondria, leading to development of the mitochondrial theory of aging. However, despite the number of studies describing the association of markers of oxidative damage with advancing age, few, if any definitively link oxidative injury to altered energy production or cellular function. Although a causal role for oxidative stress in the aging process has not been clearly established, this does not preclude attempts to reduce oxidative injury as a means to reduce morbidity and perhaps increase the healthy, useful life span of an individual. This review highlights studies demonstrating enhanced oxidative stress with advancing age and stresses the importance of the balance between oxidants as mediators of disease and important components of signal transduction pathways.",1999,N K Fukagawa
Drosophila Lissencephaly-1 functions with Bic-D and dynein in oocyte determination and nuclear positioning,10559989,10.1038/15680,"Here we show that the Drosophila homologue of Lissencephaly-1, DLis-1, acts together with Bicaudal-D (Bic-D), Egalitarian (Egl), dynein and microtubules to determine oocyte identity. DLis-1 is further required for nurse-cell-to-oocyte transport during oocyte growth, and for the positioning of the nucleus in the oocyte. Immunostaining of DLis-1 protein reveals a cortical localization that is independent of microtubules. DLis-1 may function in this position as a cortical anchor for the other nuclear-localization factors. DLis-1 and Bic-D are further required for nuclear localization in the developing nervous system, indicating that homologues of Bic-D, dynein and Egl-like proteins may also be involved in vertebrate neural migration and that their absence may cause a Miller-Dieker-like lissencephaly.",1999,"T Nguyen, A Swan, B Suter"
rDLG6: a novel homolog of Drosophila DLG expressed in rat brain,10558890,10.1006/bbrc.1999.1723,"Drosophila DLG (Discs Large Tumor Suppresser Protein) is a component of septate junctions, and disruption of its gene leads to over growth of imaginal discs. Homologs of Drosophila DLG recently isolated from mammalian tissue have been classified as members of the MAGUK (Membrane Associated GUanylate Kinase) superfamily of proteins. Using a modified RT-PCR method applied to rat tissues, we have isolated cDNA clones encoding a novel MAGUK family member that we have named rDLG6. Immunoblot and immunohistochemical analyses revealed that rDLG6 protein is predominantly expressed in brain.

It waned thereafter, without resolution, as it has taken time to understand what DNA data can reveal about the subject. Recent developments using DNA data from Drosophila melanogaster show that natural selection is pervasive to an extent that is surprising to some former neutralists.

Kinase-independent activity of Cdc2/cyclin A prevents the S phase in the Drosophila cell cycle,10320477,10.1046/j.1365-2443.1999.00243.x,"Background: The Cdc2-dependent inhibition of S phase is required in G2 for the correct ordering of the S and M phases in yeasts and Drosophila. This function of Cdc2 has been ascribed to its ability to phosphorylate replication factors to prevent the assembly of a preinitiation complex at the origin of replication. Whether this is the sole mechanism of S phase inhibition by Cdc2 in higher metazoans is not known because the pleiotropic functions of this essential cell cycle regulator make genetic analysis difficult. Results: We show that Cdc2 co-expressed with Cyclin A inhibits the S phase in Drosophila salivary glands and diploid abdominal histoblasts. A kinase defective mutant of Cdc2 failed to promote mitosis, but was still able to inhibit the S phase with the same efficiency as the wild-type protein. In addition, Cdc2 and Cyclin A cooperatively inhibit transcriptional activation by the essential S phase regulator E2F. Cdc2 binds to E2F in vitro, and post-transcriptionally promotes its accumulation in vivo. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of Cdc2 on S phase is overridden by E2F. Conclusion: The inhibition of S phase by Cdc2 is achieved in part by a kinase-independent mechanism, which is likely to be mediated by the inhibition of E2F.",1999,"M Yamaguchi, S Hayashi"
Direct visualization of sperm competition and sperm storage in Drosophila,10469570,10.1016/s0960-9822(99)80370-4,"Drosophila females engage in multiple matings [1] [2] [3] [4] even though they can store sperm in specialized organs for most of their life [5]. The existence of sperm competition in Drosophila has been inferred from the proportion of progeny sired by the second male in double-mating experiments [6] [7] [8]. Investigators have used this approach to quantify genetic variation underlying sperm competition [8] [9] [10], to elucidate its genetic basis [11], to identify the dependence of different male competitive ability on the genotype of the females with which they mate [12] and to discern the potential role of sperm competition in species isolation [13] [14]. This approach assumes that the sperm from two males stored in a female compete to fertilize the eggs. The mechanism by which sperm competition is accomplished is still unknown, however. Here, fluorescence microscopy, cytometry, and differently labeled sperm were used to analyze the fate of sperm inside the female's sperm storage organs, to quantify sperm competition, and to assess how closely paternity success corresponds to the appearance and location of the sperm. The results show that the first male's sperm is retained for a shortened period if the female remates, and that the second males that sire more progeny either induce females to store and use more of their sperm or strongly displace resident sperm.",1999,A Civetta
Ubiquitous expression of a Drosophila adenomatous polyposis coli homolog and its localization in cortical actin caps,10473121,10.1016/s0925-4773(99)00072-6,"We report the expression pattern of a new adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) homolog called E-APC during Drosophila development. E-APC protein is expressed in all embryonic and larval cells we have examined. In the early blastoderm embryo, we see a striking concentration of E-APC in the cortical actin caps. Microtubules are closely associated with these caps. Since human APC has been reported to bind to microtubules, we investigated whether the cortical E-APC co-localizes with tubulin. However, this was not the case, implying that the putative tubulin-binding property of human APC is not well conserved.",1999,"M Bienz, X Yu"
Structure and regulated expression of the delta-aminolevulinate synthase gene from Drosophila melanogaster,10601299,10.1074/jbc.274.52.37321,"The structure of the single copy gene encoding the putative housekeeping isoform of Drosophila melanogaster delta-aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS) has been determined. Southern and immunoblot analyses suggest that only the housekeeping isoform of the enzyme exists in Drosophila. We have localized a critical region for promoter activity to a sequence of 121 base pairs that contains a motif that is potentially recognized by factors of the nuclear respiratory factor-1 (NRF-1)/P3A2 family, flanked by two AP4 sites. Heme inhibits the expression of the gene by blocking the interaction of putative regulatory proteins to its 5' proximal region, a mechanism different from those proposed for other hemin-regulated promoters. Northern and in situ RNA hybridization experiments show that maternal alas mRNA is stored in the egg; its steady-state level decreases rapidly during the first hours of development and increases again after gastrulation in a period where the synthesis of several mRNAs encoding metabolic enzymes is activated. In the syncytial blastoderm, the alas mRNA is ubiquitously distributed and decreases in abundance substantially through cellular blastoderm. Late in embryonic development alas shows a specific pattern of expression, with an elevated mRNA level in oenocytes, suggesting an important role of these cells in the biosynthesis of hemoproteins in Drosophila.",1999,"M A Fernández-Moreno, R Garesse, B Bornstein, L S Kaguni, I Ruiz de Mena"

The N-terminal domain of Sxl protein disrupts Sxl autoregulation in females and promotes female-specific splicing of tra in males,10357929,,"Sex determination in Drosophila depends upon the post-transcriptional regulatory activities of the Sex-lethal (Sxl) gene. Sxl maintains the female determined state and activates female differentiation pathways by directing the female-specific splicing of Sxl and tra pre-mRNAs. While there is compelling evidence that Sxl proteins regulate splicing by directly binding to target RNAs, previous studies indicate that the two Sxl RNA-binding domains are not in themselves sufficient for biological activity and that an intact N-terminal domain is also critical for splicing function. To further investigate the functions of the Sxl N terminus, we ectopically expressed a chimeric protein consisting of the N-terminal 99 amino acids fused to ss-galactosidase. The Nss-gal fusion protein behaves like a dominant negative, interfering with the Sxl autoregulatory feedback loop and killing females. This dominant negative activity can be attributed to the recruitment of the fusion protein into the large Sxl:Snf splicing complexes that are found in vivo and the consequent disruption of these complexes. In addition to the dominant negative activity, the Nss-gal fusion protein has a novel gain-of-function activity in males: it promotes the female-specific processing of tra pre-mRNAs. This novel activity is discussed in light of the blockage model for the tra splicing regulation.",1999,"P D Schedl, G Deshpande, G Calhoun"

NTP technical report on the toxicity and metabolism studies of chloral hydrate (CAS No. 302-17-0). Administered by gavage to F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice,11803702,,"Chloral hydrate is widely used as a sedative and a hypnotic in pediatric medicine. It is also a byproduct of water chlorination. Chloral hydrate has been shown to be genotoxic in numerous prokaryotic and eukaryotic assay systems including human lymphocytes in vitro. One of its metabolites, trichloroacetic acid, has demonstrated hepatocarcinogenic activity in mice. Trichloroethylene and perchloroethylene, both of which are metabolized to chloral hydrate, have been shown to be carcinogenic in rats and/or mice. Because of this evidence of carcinogenicity and because of the wide-spread use of chloral hydrate, 16- or 17-day range-finding toxicity studies and separate 16- or 17-day metabolism studies were performed in F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice in preparation for further long-term rodent studies. In addition, in vitro studies of the metabolism and DNA-binding capacity of chloral hydrate and its metabolites were performed. Genetic toxicity studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium, cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, Drosophila melanogaster, and mouse bone marrow cells. For the range-finding studies, groups of eight male and eight female F344/N Nctr BR rats and B6C3F1/Nctr BR (C57BL/6N x C3H/HeN MTV-) mice were administered 0, 50, 100, 200, 400, or 800 mg chloral hydrate per kg body weight in water by gavage 5 days per week for 17 days (rats) or 16 days (mice) for a total of 12 doses. One male rat receiving 800 mg/kg died after five doses. Two 800 mg/kg female rats died after dosing ended but before study termination. One male mouse in each group except the 400 mg/kg group died before the end of the study. Two 800 mg/kg female mice also died before the end of the study. The final mean body weight of 800 mg/kg male rats and the mean body weight gains of 400 and 800 mg/kg males were significantly less than those of the vehicle controls. The mean body weight gains of all groups of dosed male mice were significantly greater than that of the vehicle control group. The only clinical finding in rats and mice attributed to chloral hydrate treatment was light sedation in the 400 mg/kg groups and heavy sedation in the 800 mg/kg groups; sedation subsided within 30 minutes or 3 hours, respectively. The liver weights of 400 mg/kg male mice and 800 mg/kg male and female mice were significantly greater than those of the vehicle control groups. No chemical-related lesions were observed in rats or mice. Male and female rats and mice were administered a single dose of 50 or 200 mg chloral hydrate per kg body weight in water by gavage, or 12 doses of 50 or 200 mg/kg over 17 days (rats) or 16 days (mice). Plasma concentrations of chloral hydrate and its metabolites were determined 15 minutes, 1, 3, 6, and 24 hours, and 2, 4, 8, and 16 days after receiving 1 or 12 doses. Maximum concentrations of chloral hydrate were observed at the initial sampling point of 15 minutes. By 1 hour, the concentrations had dropped substantially, and by 3 hours, chloral hydrate could not be detected in rats or mice. Trichloroacetic acid was the major metabolite detected in the plasma. In rats, the concentrations rose slowly, with the peaks occurring between 1 and 6 hours after treatment. In mice, the peak concentrations were found 1 hour after dosing. The concentrations then slowly decreased such that by 2 days the metabolite could no longer be detected in rats or mice. Trichloroethanol was assayed both as the free alcohol and its glucuronide. In rats, the maximum concentrations of free trichloroethanol occurred at 15 minutes, while the peak concentrations of trichloroethanol glucuronide were found at 1 hour; by 3 hours, concentrations of both metabolites approached background levels. In mice, the maximum concentrations of both metabolites occurred at 15 minutes, and by 1 to 3 hours concentrations approached background levels. The plasma concentrations of chloral hydrate and its metabolites were dose dependent in rats and mice. In mice, plasma concentrations of trichloroacetic acid were significantly higher after a single dose than after 12 doses. None of the metabolic parameters appears to account for species differences that may exist in hepatocarcinogenicity. The data from the study of metabolism and DNA adduct formation indicated that in vitro metabolism of 200 microM to 5 mM chloral hydrate by male B6C3F1 mouse liver microsomes (control microsomes) generated free radical intermediates that resulted in endogenous lipid peroxidation, forming malondialdehyde, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acetone, and propionaldehyde. Similar concentrations of trichloroacetic acid and trichloroethanol, the primary metabolites of chloral hydrate, also generated free radicals and induced lipid peroxidation. Lipid peroxidation induced by trichloroacetic acid nearly equaled that induced by chloral hydrate, while that from trichloroethanol was three- to fourfold less. Metabolism of 200 microM to 5 mM chloral hydrate, trichloroacetic acid, and trichloroethanol by liver microsomes of B6C3F1 mice pretreated with pyrazole (pyrazole-induced microsomes) yielded lipid peroxidation products at concentrations two- to threefold greater than those from liver microsomes of untreated mice. Additionally, chloral hydrate-induced lipid peroxidation catalyzed by control and pyrazole-induced microsomes was reduced significantly by 2,4-dichloro-6-phenylphenoxyethylamine, a general cytochrome P450 inhibitor. Human lymphoblastoid transgenic cells expressing cytochrome P(450)2E1 metabolized 200 to 5,000 micrograms/mL chloral hydrate to reactants inducing mutations, whereas the parental cell line was inactive. The malondialdehyde-modified DNA adduct, 3-(2-deoxy-beta-D-erythro-pentofuranosyl)pyrimido[1,2 alpha]purin-10(3H)-one (MDA-MG-1), formed from the metabolism of 1 mM chloral hydrate, trichloroacetic acid, and trichloroethanol by control B6C3F1 mouse liver microsomes, mouse pyrazole-induced microsomes, male F344/N rat liver microsomes, and human liver microsomes in the presence and absence of calf thymus DNA was also determined. When incubated in the absence of calf thymus DNA, the amount of malondialdehyde formed from metabolism by pyrazole-induced mouse microsomes was twice that from rat or human liver microsomes. Amounts of chloral hydrate-induced and trichloroacetic acid-induced lipid peroxidation products formed from metabolism by rat and human liver microsomes were similar, and these quantities were about twice those formed from the metabolism of trichloroethanol. The quantity of MDA-MG-1 formed from the metabolism of chloral hydrate, trichloroacetic acid, and trichloroethanol by mouse, rat, and human liver microsomes exhibited a linear correlation with the quantity of malondialdehyde formed under incubation conditions in the absence of calf thymus DNA. Chloral hydrate was shown to be mutagenic in vitro and in vivo. At doses from 1,000 to 10,000 micrograms/plate, it induced mutations in S. typhimurium strain TA100, with and without S9 activation; an equivocal response was obtained in S. typhimurium strain TA98 in the absence of S9, and no mutagenicity was detected with strain TA1535 or TA1537. Chloral hydrate at doses from 1,700 to 5,000 micrograms/mL induced sister chromatid exchanges; at doses from 1,000 to 3,000 micrograms/mL, chromosomal aberrations were induced in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, with and without S9. Results of a sex-linked recessive lethal test in D. melanogaster were unclear; administration of chloral hydrate by feeding produced an inconclusive increase in recessive lethal mutations, results of the injection experiment were negative. An in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus test with chloral hydrate at doses from 125 to 500 mg/kg gave a positive dose trend. In summary, due to the absence of chloral hydrate-induced histopathologic lesions in rats and mice, no-observed-adverse-effect levels (NOAELs) were based on body weights of rats and liver weights of mice. The NOAELs for rats and mice were 200 mg/kg. Chloral hydrate was rapidly metabolized by rats and mice, with trichloroacetic acid occurring as the major metabolite. Peak concentrations of trichloroacetic acid occurred more quickly in mice. Plasma concentrations of chloral hydrate were dose dependent, but metabolic rates were unaffected by dose or sex. Chloral hydrate was mutagenic in vitro and in vivo. Metabolism of chloral hydrate and its metabolites produced free radicals that resulted in lipid peroxidation in liver microsomes of mice, rats, and humans. Induction of cytochrome P(450)2E1 by pyrazole increased the concentrations of lipid peroxidation products; inhibition of cytochrome P(450)2E1 by 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine reduced these concentrations. Metabolism of chloral hydrate and its metabolites by mouse, rat, and human liver microsomes formed malondialdehyde, and in the presence of calf thymus DNA formed the DNA adduct MDA-MG-1.",1999,F A Beland
X-ngnr-1 and Xath3 promote ectopic expression of sensory neuron markers in the neurula ectoderm and have distinct inducing properties in the retina,10611326,10.1073/pnas.96.26.14996,"Xath3 encodes a Xenopus neuronal-specific basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor related to the Drosophila proneural factor atonal. We show here that Xath3 acts downstream of X-ngnr-1 during neuronal differentiation in the neural plate and retina and that its expression and activity are modulated by Notch signaling. X-ngnr-1 activates Xath3 and NeuroD by different mechanisms, and the latter two genes crossactivate each other. In the ectoderm, X-ngnr-1 and Xath3 have similar activities, inducing ectopic sensory neurons. Among the sensory-specific markers tested, only those that label cranial neurons were found to be ectopically activated. By contrast, in the retina, X-ngnr-1 and Xath3 overexpression promote the development of overlapping but distinct subtypes of retinal neurons. Together, these data suggest that X-ngnr-1 and Xath3 regulate successive stages of early neuronal differentiation and that, in addition to their general proneural properties, they may contribute, in a context-dependent manner, to some aspect of neuronal identity.",1999,"W A Harris, M Perron, K Butler, K Opdecamp, E J Bellefroid"
Change in sexual size dimorphism as a correlated response to selection on fecundity,10651914,10.1046/j.1365-2540.1999.00616.x,"Fecundity selection is often suggested as the main causal factor underlying the prevalence of female-biased sexual size dimorphism (SSD), but this assumption has not been empirically tested. We selected female Drosophila melanogaster for increased or decreased fecundity (eggs laid over a single 18-h period, between days 5 and 7 posteclosion) for 20 generations, to see what effect this would have on SSD in three morphological traits (thorax width, abdomen width and thorax length). A direct response to fecundity selection was found in the downward direction (16.6%), whereas the response to upward selection (5.7%) was not statistically significant. Significant sex by selection interaction terms in the ANOVAs for thorax width and abdomen width indicate that the two sexes responded differently. Females usually showed a greater correlated response than males. In lines selected for increased fecundity, the correlated response in females for thorax and abdomen width was greater than the direct response in standard deviation units. SSD generally increased with selection for increased fecundity, but showed no consistent trend with selection for decreased fecundity. These results support the general hypothesis that SSD can evolve rapidly in response to fecundity selection. Selection on fecundity also produced correlated responses in life history traits. Downward selection resulted in flies that had lower viability and longevity, and both directions of selection were associated with an increase in development time.",1999,"D J Fairbairn, J P Reeve"
Not4 enhances JAK/STAT pathway-dependent gene expression in Drosophila and in human cells,22159038,10.1096/fj.11-195875,"The JAK/STAT pathway is essential for organogenesis, innate immunity, and stress responses in Drosophila melanogaster. The JAK/STAT pathway and its associated regulators have been highly conserved in evolution from flies to humans. We have used a genome-wide RNAi screen in Drosophila S2 cells to identify regulators of the JAK/STAT pathway, and here we report the characterization of Not4 as a positive regulator of the JAK/STAT pathway. Overexpression of Not4 enhanced Stat92E-mediated gene responses in vitro and in vivo in Drosophila. Specifically, Not4 increased Stat92E-mediated reporter gene activation in S2 cells; and in flies, Not4 overexpression resulted in an 8-fold increase in Turandot M (TotM) and in a 4-fold increase in Turandot A (TotA) stress gene activation when compared to wild-type flies. Drosophila Not4 is structurally related to human CNOT4, which was found to regulate interferon-γ- and interleukin-4-induced STAT-mediated gene responses in human HeLa cells. Not4 was found to coimmunoprecipitate with Stat92E but not to affect tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat92E in Drosophila cells. However, Not4 is required for binding of Stat92E to its DNA recognition sequence in the TotM gene promoter. In summary, Not4/CNOT4 is a novel positive regulator of the JAK/STAT pathway in Drosophila and in humans.",2012,"Henna Myllymäki, Olli Silvennoinen, Jesper Kronhamn, Juha Grönholm, Meri Kaustio, Susanna Valanne, Jenni Kallio, Mika Rämet, Juha Saarikettu"
"Oocyte-somatic cells interactions, lessons from evolution",23083410,10.1186/1471-2164-13-560,"Background: Despite the known importance of somatic cells for oocyte developmental competence acquisition, the overall mechanisms underlying the acquisition of full developmental competence are far from being understood, especially in non-mammalian species. The present work aimed at identifying key molecular signals from somatic origin that would be shared by vertebrates. Results: Using a parallel transcriptomic analysis in 4 vertebrate species - a teleost fish, an amphibian, and two mammals - at similar key steps of developmental competence acquisition, we identified a large number of species-specific differentially expressed genes and a surprisingly high number of orthologous genes exhibiting similar expression profiles in the 3 tetrapods and in the 4 vertebrates. Among the evolutionary conserved players participating in developmental competence acquisition are genes involved in key processes such as cellular energy metabolism, cell-to-cell communications, and meiosis control. In addition, we report many novel molecular actors from somatic origin that have never been studied in the vertebrate ovary. Interestingly, a significant number of these new players actively participate in Drosophila oogenesis. Conclusions: Our study provides a comprehensive overview of evolutionary-conserved mechanisms from somatic origin participating in oocyte developmental competence acquisition in 4 vertebrates. Together our results indicate that despite major differences in ovarian follicular structure, some of the key players from somatic origin involved in oocyte developmental competence acquisition would be shared, not only by vertebrates, but also by metazoans. The conservation of these mechanisms during vertebrate evolution further emphasizes the important contribution of the somatic compartment to oocyte quality and paves the way for future investigations aiming at better understanding what makes a good egg.",2012,"Aurélie Le Cam, Franck Chesnel, Olivier Chabrol, Jérôme Montfort, Laurent Richard-Parpaillon, Daphné Brisard, François Moreews, Thaovi Nguyen, Cathy Charlier, Pierre Pontarotti, Julien Bobe, Svetlana Uzbekova"

"Uracil-containing DNA in Drosophila: stability, stage-specific accumulation, and developmental involvement",22685418,10.1371/journal.pgen.1002738,"Base-excision repair and control of nucleotide pools safe-guard against permanent uracil accumulation in DNA relying on two key enzymes: uracil-DNA glycosylase and dUTPase. Lack of the major uracil-DNA glycosylase UNG gene from the fruit fly genome and dUTPase from fruit fly larvae prompted the hypotheses that i) uracil may accumulate in Drosophila genomic DNA where it may be well tolerated, and ii) this accumulation may affect development. Here we show that i) Drosophila melanogaster tolerates high levels of uracil in DNA; ii) such DNA is correctly interpreted in cell culture and embryo; and iii) under physiological spatio-temporal control, DNA from fruit fly larvae, pupae, and imago contain greatly elevated levels of uracil (200-2,000 uracil/million bases, quantified using a novel real-time PCR-based assay). Uracil is accumulated in genomic DNA of larval tissues during larval development, whereas DNA from imaginal tissues contains much less uracil. Upon pupation and metamorphosis, uracil content in DNA is significantly decreased. We propose that the observed developmental pattern of uracil-DNA is due to the lack of the key repair enzyme UNG from the Drosophila genome together with down-regulation of dUTPase in larval tissues. In agreement, we show that dUTPase silencing increases the uracil content in DNA of imaginal tissues and induces strong lethality at the early pupal stages, indicating that tolerance of highly uracil-substituted DNA is also stage-specific. Silencing of dUTPase perturbs the physiological pattern of uracil-DNA accumulation in Drosophila and leads to a strongly lethal phenotype in early pupal stages. These findings suggest a novel role of uracil-containing DNA in Drosophila development and metamorphosis and present a novel example for developmental effects of dUTPase silencing in multicellular eukaryotes. Importantly, we also show lack of the UNG gene in all available genomes of other Holometabola insects, indicating a potentially general tolerance and developmental role of uracil-DNA in this evolutionary clade.",2012,"Gábor Merényi, Mária Pukáncsik, Beáta G Vértessy, Angéla Békési, András Horváth, István Kiss, Péter Vilmos, Miklós Erdélyi, Gergely Róna, Ferenc Jankovics, Júlia Batki, Villő Muha, Barbara Hodoscsek"
Regulatory RNAs in the light of Drosophila genomics,22956639,10.1093/bfgp/els033,"Many aspects of gene regulation are mediated by RNA molecules. However, regulatory RNAs have remained elusive until very recently. At least three types of small regulatory RNAs have been characterized in Drosophila: microRNAs (miRNAs), piwi-interacting RNAs and endogenous siRNAs. A fourth class of regulatory RNAs includes known long non-coding RNAs such as roX1 or bxd. The initial sequencing of the Drosophila melanogaster genome has served as a scaffold to study the transcriptional profile of an animal, revealing the complexities of the function and biogenesis of regulatory RNAs. The comparative analysis of 12 Drosophila genomes has been crucial for the study of microRNA evolution. However, comparative genomics of other RNA regulators is confounded by technical problems: genomic loci are poorly conserved and frequently encoded in the heterochromatin.

Coleopteran antimicrobial peptides: prospects for clinical applications,22500175,10.1155/2012/101989,"Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are activated in response to septic injury and have important roles in vertebrate and invertebrate immune systems. AMPs act directly against pathogens and have both wound healing and antitumor activities. Although coleopterans comprise the largest and most diverse order of eukaryotes and occupy an earlier branch than Drosophila in the holometabolous lineage of insects, their immune system has not been studied extensively. Initial research reports, however, indicate that coleopterans possess unique immune response mechanisms, and studies of these novel mechanisms may help to further elucidate innate immunity. Recently, the complete genome sequence of Tribolium was published, boosting research on coleopteran immunity and leading to the identification of Tribolium AMPs that are shared by Drosophila and mammals, as well as other AMPs that are unique.

"Inhibition of biofilm formation, quorum sensing and infection in Pseudomonas aeruginosa by natural products-inspired organosulfur compounds",22715388,10.1371/journal.pone.0038492,"Using a microplate-based screening assay, the effects on Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 biofilm formation of several S-substituted cysteine sulfoxides and their corresponding disulfide derivatives were evaluated. From our library of compounds, S-phenyl-L-cysteine sulfoxide and its breakdown product, diphenyl disulfide, significantly reduced the amount of biofilm formation by P. aeruginosa at levels equivalent to the active concentration of 4-nitropyridine-N-oxide (NPO) (1 mM). Unlike NPO, which is an established inhibitor of bacterial biofilms, our active compounds did not reduce planktonic cell growth and only affected biofilm formation. When used in a Drosophila-based infection model, both S-phenyl-L-cysteine sulfoxide and diphenyl disulfide significantly reduced the P. aeruginosa recovered 18 h post infection (relative to the control), and were non-lethal to the fly hosts. The possibility that the observed biofilm inhibitory effects were related to quorum sensing inhibition (QSI) was investigated using Escherichia coli-based reporters expressing P. aeruginosa lasR or rhIR response proteins, as well as an endogenous P. aeruginosa reporter from the lasI/lasR QS system. Inhibition of quorum sensing by S-phenyl-L-cysteine sulfoxide was observed in all of the reporter systems tested, whereas diphenyl disulfide did not exhibit QSI in either of the E. coli reporters, and showed very limited inhibition in the P. aeruginosa reporter. Since both compounds inhibit biofilm formation but do not show similar QSI activity, it is concluded that they may be functioning by different pathways. The hypothesis that biofilm inhibition by the two active compounds discovered in this work occurs through QSI is discussed.",2012,"Roman Kubec, Kurt A McKean, Stephen H Kasper, Nathaniel C Cady, Rabi A Musah, Aaron P Mosier, David S Burz, Jason Behnke"
A model of epithelial invagination driven by collective mechanics of identical cells,23009857,10.1016/j.bpj.2012.07.018,"We propose a 2D mechanical model of a tubular epithelium resembling the early Drosophila embryo. The model consists of a single layer of identical cells with energy associated with the tension of cell cortex. Depending on the relative tension of the apical, basal, and lateral sides of the cells, tissue thickness, and the degree of external constraint, the minimal-energy states of the epithelial cross section include circular shapes as well as a range of inward-buckled shapes. Some of the solutions are characterized by a single deep groove, which shows that an epithelium consisting of cells of identical mechanical properties can infold. This is consistent with what is seen in embryos of certain Drosophila mutants. To ensure that the infolding occurs at a predetermined section of the epithelium, we extend the model by increasing the cross-sectional area of a subset of cells, which is consistent with observations in wild-type embryos. This variation of cell parameters across the epithelium is sufficient to make it fold at a specific site. The model explores previously untested minimal conditions for tissue invagination and is devoid of specificity needed to accurately describe an in vivo situation in Drosophila.",2012,"Maria Leptin, Primož Ziherl, Ana Hočevar Brezavšček, Matteo Rauzi"
Evolutionary conserved role of c-Jun-N-terminal kinase in CO2-induced epithelial dysfunction,23056407,10.1371/journal.pone.0046696,"Elevated CO(2) levels (hypercapnia) occur in patients with respiratory diseases and impair alveolar epithelial integrity, in part, by inhibiting Na,K-ATPase function. Here, we examined the role of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in CO(2) signaling in mammalian alveolar epithelial cells as well as in diptera, nematodes and rodent lungs. In alveolar epithelial cells, elevated CO(2) levels rapidly induced activation of JNK leading to downregulation of Na,K-ATPase and alveolar epithelial dysfunction. Hypercapnia-induced activation of JNK required AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and protein kinase C-ζ leading to subsequent phosphorylation of JNK at Ser-129. Importantly, elevated CO(2) levels also caused a rapid and prominent activation of JNK in Drosophila S2 cells and in C. elegans. Paralleling the results with mammalian epithelial cells, RNAi against Drosophila JNK fully prevented CO(2)-induced downregulation of Na,K-ATPase in Drosophila S2 cells. The importance and specificity of JNK CO(2) signaling was additionally demonstrated by the ability of mutations in the C. elegans JNK homologs, jnk-1 and kgb-2 to partially rescue the hypercapnia-induced fertility defects but not the pharyngeal pumping defects.

These results thus link sexual experience, NPF system activity, and ethanol consumption.

Local and global methods of assessing thermal nociception in Drosophila larvae,22643884,10.3791/3837,"In this article, we demonstrate assays to study thermal nociception in Drosophila larvae. One assay involves spatially-restricted (local) stimulation of thermal nociceptors while the second involves a wholesale (global) activation of most or all such neurons. Together, these techniques allow visualization and quantification of the behavioral functions of Drosophila nociceptive sensory neurons. The Drosophila larva is an established model system to study thermal nociception, a sensory response to potentially harmful temperatures that is evolutionarily conserved across species. The advantages of Drosophila for such studies are the relative simplicity of its nervous system and the sophistication of the genetic techniques that can be used to dissect the molecular basis of the underlying biology In Drosophila, as in all metazoans, the response to noxious thermal stimuli generally involves a ""nocifensive"" aversive withdrawal to the presented stimulus. Such stimuli are detected through free nerve endings or nociceptors and the amplitude of the organismal response depends on the number of nociceptors receiving the noxious stimulus. In Drosophila, it is the class IV dendritic arborization sensory neurons that detect noxious thermal and mechanical stimuli in addition to their recently discovered role as photoreceptors. These neurons, which have been very well studied at the developmental level, arborize over the barrier epidermal sheet and make contacts with nearly all epidermal cells. The single axon of each class IV neuron projects into the ventral nerve cord of the central nervous system where they may connect to second-order neurons that project to the brain. Under baseline conditions, nociceptive sensory neurons will not fire until a relatively high threshold is reached. The assays described here allow the investigator to quantify baseline behavioral responses or, presumably, the sensitization that ensues following tissue damage. Each assay provokes distinct but related locomotory behavioral responses to noxious thermal stimuli and permits the researcher to visualize and quantify various aspects of thermal nociception in Drosophila larvae. The assays can be applied to larvae of desired genotypes or to larvae raised under different environmental conditions that might impact nociception. Since thermal nociception is conserved across species, the findings gleaned from genetic dissection in Drosophila will likely inform our understanding of thermal nociception in other species, including vertebrates.",2012,"A'Tondra V Gilstrap, Michael J Galko, Abanti Chattopadhyay"

In most cases, flies with constitutive and conditional D-GADD45 overexpression in the nervous system were more stress-resistant than ones without overexpression. At the same time, most of the studied stress factors increased D-GADD45 expression in the wild-type strain. The lifespan-extending effect of D-GADD45 overexpression was also retained after exposure to chronic and acute gamma-irradiation, with doses of 40 сGy and 30 Gy, respectively. However, knocking out D-GADD45 resulted in a significant reduction in lifespan, lack of radiation hormesis and radioadaptive response. A dramatic decrease in the spontaneous level of D-GADD45 expression was observed in the nervous system as age progressed, which may be one of the causes of the age-related deterioration of organismal stress resistance. Thus, D-GADD45 expression is activated by most of the studied stress factors, and D-GADD45 overexpression resulted in an increase of stress resistance.",2012,"Alexander Zhavoronkov, Alexey Moskalev, Mikhail Shaposhnikov, Alexey Kazachenok, Ekaterina Plyusnina, Lyubov Shilova"
Role of rhodopsin and arrestin phosphorylation in retinal degeneration of Drosophila,22855823,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0565-12.2012,"Arrestins belong to a family of multifunctional adaptor proteins that regulate internalization of diverse receptors including G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Defects associated with endocytosis of GPCRs have been linked to human diseases. We used enhanced green fluorescent protein-tagged arrestin 2 (Arr2) to monitor the turnover of the major rhodopsin (Rh1) in live Drosophila. We demonstrate that during degeneration of norpA(P24) photoreceptors the loss of Rh1 is parallel to the disappearance of rhabdomeres, the specialized visual organelle that houses Rh1. The cause of degeneration in norpA(P24) is the failure to activate CaMKII (Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II) and retinal degeneration C (RDGC) because of a loss of light-dependent Ca(2+) entry. A lack of activation in CaMKII, which phosphorylates Arr2, leads to hypophosphorylated Arr2, while a lack of activation of RDGC, which dephosphorylates Rh1, results in hyperphosphorylated Rh1. We investigated how reversible phosphorylation of Rh1 and Arr2 contributes to photoreceptor degeneration. To uncover the consequence underlying a lack of CaMKII activation, we characterized ala(1) flies in which CaMKII was suppressed by an inhibitory peptide, and showed that morphology of rhabdomeres was not affected. In contrast, we found that expression of phosphorylation-deficient Rh1s, which either lack the C terminus or contain Ala substitution in the phosphorylation sites, was able to prevent degeneration of norpA(P24) photoreceptors. This suppression is not due to a loss of Arr2 interaction. Importantly, co-expression of these modified Rh1s offered protective effects, which greatly delayed photoreceptor degeneration. Together, we conclude that phosphorylation of Rh1 is the major determinant that orchestrates its internalization leading to retinal degeneration.",2012,"Inga Kristaponyte, Bih-Hwa Shieh, Haiqin Lu, Yuan Hong"
Two odorant-binding proteins mediate the behavioural response of aphids to the alarm pheromone (E)-ß-farnesene and structural analogues,22427877,10.1371/journal.pone.0032759,"Background: Aphids are agricultural pests of great economical interest. Alternatives to insecticides, using semiochemicals, are of difficult applications. In fact, sex pheromones are of little use as aphids reproduce partenogenetically most of the time. Besides, the alarm pheromone, (E)-ß-farnesene for a great number of species, is difficult to synthesize and unstable in the environment. The search for novel semiochemicals to be used in population control can be efficiently approached through the study of the olfactory system at the biochemical level. Recently odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) have been shown to play a central role in olfactory recognition, thus becoming the target of choice for designing new semiochemicals. Methodology/principal findings: To address the question of how the alarm message is recognised at the level of OBPs, we have tested 29 compounds, including (E)-ß-farnesene, in binding assays with 6 recombinant proteins and in behaviour experiments. We have found that good repellents bind OBP3 and/or OBP7, while non repellents present different spectra of binding. These results have been verified with two species of aphids, Acyrthosiphon pisum and Myzus persicae, both using (E)-ß-farnesene as the alarm pheromone. Conclusions: Our results represent further support to the idea (so far convincingly demonstrated only in Drosophila) that OBPs are involved in decoding the chemical information of odorants and pheromones, and for the first time provide such evidence in other insect species and using wild-type insects. Moreover, the data offer guidelines and protocols for the discovery of potential alarm pheromones, using ligand-binding assays as a preliminary screening before subjecting selected compounds to behaviour tests.",2012,"Yu Feng Sun, Yun Ling, Donatella Battaglia, Lea Riviello, Xin Ling Yang, Patrizia Falabella, Hui Li Qiao, Immacolata Iovinella, Filomena De Biasio, Paolo Pelosi, Shao Xiang Yang"
"Secreted, receptor-associated bone morphogenetic protein regulators reduce stochastic noise intrinsic to many extracellular morphogen distributions",22012974,10.1098/rsif.2011.0547,"Morphogens are secreted molecules that specify cell-fate organization in developing tissues. Patterns of gene expression or signalling immediately downstream of many morphogens such as the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) decapentaplegic (Dpp) are highly reproducible and robust to perturbations. This contrasts starkly with our expectation of a noisy interpretation that would arise out of the experimentally determined low concentration (approximately picomolar) range of Dpp activity, tight receptor binding and very slow kinetic rates. To investigate mechanisms by which the intrinsic noise can be attenuated in Dpp signalling, we focus on a class of secreted proteins that bind to Dpp in the extracellular environment and play an active role in regulating Dpp/receptor interactions. We developed a stochastic model of Dpp signalling in Drosophila melanogaster and used the model to quantify the extent that stochastic fluctuations would lead to errors in spatial patterning and extended the model to investigate how a surface-associated BMP-binding protein (SBP) such as Crossveinless-2 (Cv-2) may buffer out signalling noise. In the presence of SBPs, fluctuations in the level of ligand-bound receptor can be reduced by more than twofold depending on parameter values for the intermediate transition states. Regulation of receptor-ligand interactions by SBPs may also increase the frequency of stochastic fluctuations providing a separation of timescales between high-frequency receptor equilibration and slower morphogen patterning. High-frequency noise generated by SBP regulation is easily attenuated by the intracellular network creating a system that imitates the performance of a simple low-pass filter common in audio and communication applications. Together, these data indicate that one of the benefits of receptor-ligand regulation by secreted non-receptors may be greater reliability of morphogen patterning mechanisms.",2012,"David M Umulis, Gregery T Buzzard, Mohammad Shahriar Karim"
The RhoGEF Zizimin-related acts in the Drosophila cellular immune response via the Rho GTPases Rac2 and Cdc42,22634526,10.1016/j.dci.2012.05.004,"Zizimin-related (Zir), a Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (RhoGEF) homologous to the mammalian Dock-C/Zizimin-related family, was identified in a screen to find new genes involved in the Drosophila melanogaster cellular immune response against eggs from the parasitoid wasp Leptopilina boulardi. RhoGEFs activate Rho-family GTPases, which are known to be central regulators of cell migration, spreading and polarity. When a parasitoid wasp is recognized as foreign, multiple layers of circulating immunosurveillance cells (haemocytes) should attach to the egg. In Zir mutants this process is disrupted and lamellocytes, a haemocyte subtype, fail to properly encapsulate the wasp egg. Furthermore, macrophage-like plasmatocytes exhibit a strong reduction in their ability to phagocytise Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. During encapsulation and phagocytosis Zir genetically interacts with two Rho-family GTPases, Rac2 and Cdc42. Finally, Zir is dispensable for the humoral immune response against bacteria. We propose that Zir is necessary to activate the Rho-family GTPases Rac2 and Cdc42 during the Drosophila cellular immune response.",2012,"Marie-Odile Fauvarque, Mika Rämet, Susanna Valanne, Christopher J Sampson, Dan Hultmark, Michael J Williams"
Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells for expression of heterologous genes: From gene cloning to bioprocess development,22079894,10.1016/j.biotechadv.2011.10.009,"In the present review we discuss strategies that have been used for heterologous gene expression in Drosophila melanogaster Schneider 2 (S2) cells using plasmid vectors. Since the growth of S2 cells is not dependent on anchorage to solid substrates, these cells can be easily cultured in suspension in large volumes. The factors that most affect the growth and gene expression of S2 cells, namely cell line, cell passage, inoculum concentration, culture medium, temperature, dissolved oxygen concentration, pH, hydrodynamic forces and toxic metabolites, are discussed by comparison with other insect and mammalian cells.

The minute brain of the copepod Tigriopus californicus supports a complex ancestral ground pattern of the tetraconate cerebral nervous systems,22431149,10.1002/cne.23099,"Copepods are a diverse and ecologically crucial group of minute crustaceans that are relatively neglected in terms of studies on nervous system organization. Recently, morphological neural characters have helped clarify evolutionary relationships within Arthropoda, particularly among Tetraconata (i.e., crustaceans and hexapods), and indicate that copepods occupy an important phylogenetic position relating to both Malacostraca and Hexapoda. This taxon therefore provides the opportunity to evaluate those neural characters common to these two clades likely to be results of shared ancestry (homology) versus convergence (homoplasy). Here we present an anatomical characterization of the brain and central nervous system of the well-studied harpacticoid copepod species Tigriopus californicus. We show that this species is endowed with a complex brain possessing a central complex comprising a protocerebral bridge and central body. Deutocerebral glomeruli are supplied by the antennular nerves, and a lateral protocerebral olfactory neuropil corresponds to the malacostracan hemiellipsoid body. Glomeruli contain synaptic specializations comparable to the presynaptic ""T-bars"" typical of dipterous insects, including Drosophila melanogaster. Serotonin-like immunoreactivity pervades the brain and ventral nervous system, with distinctive deutocerebral distributions. The present observations suggest that a suite of morphological characters typifying the Tigriopus brain reflect a ground pattern organization of an ancestral Tetraconata, which possessed an elaborate and structurally differentiated nervous system.",2012,"Nicholas J Strausfeld, David R Andrew, Sheena M Brown"
A protein delivery system using 30Kc19 cell-penetrating protein originating from silkworm,22981778,10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.08.063,"Cell-penetrating protein and its protein transduction domain have been used to deliver drugs and proteins into the cells via receptor-independent endocytosis. A number of cell-penetrating proteins including TAT derived from HIV-1 virus, VP22 from herpes simplex virus and Antennapedia from drosophila have been discovered. Here, we report a cell-penetrating protein, 30Kc19, originating from the hemolymph of silkworm, Bombyx mori. The 30Kc19 is the first cell-penetrating protein that has been found in insect hemolymph. When the 30Kc19 protein produced from recombinant Escherichia coli was supplemented into the medium for mammalian cell culture, 30Kc19 efficiently penetrated into various types of cells and localized at subcellular compartments including mitochondria and cytoplasm. 30Kc19 also delivered cargo proteins such as green fluorescence protein into the cells even though cargo proteins are not able to penetrate into cells by themselves. In addition to the in vitro system, 30Kc19 exhibited the protein transduction property in vivo. When 30Kc19 was intraperitoneally injected into mice, 30Kc19 delivered cargo proteins into various organ tissues of model animals without producing toxicity. Therefore, 30Kc19 has a great potential as a cell-penetrating protein that can be used as a medicinal tool to deliver cargo molecules including proteins into the target organ tissues in the body.",2012,"Won Jong Rhee, Tai Hyun Park, Hee Ho Park, Ju Hyun Lee, Shin Sik Choi, Ju Hyun Park"
Akirin links twist-regulated transcription with the Brahma chromatin remodeling complex during embryogenesis,22396663,10.1371/journal.pgen.1002547,"The activities of developmentally critical transcription factors are regulated via interactions with cofactors. Such interactions influence transcription factor activity either directly through protein-protein interactions or indirectly by altering the local chromatin environment. Using a yeast double-interaction screen, we identified a highly conserved nuclear protein, Akirin, as a novel cofactor of the key Drosophila melanogaster mesoderm and muscle transcription factor Twist. We find that Akirin interacts genetically and physically with Twist to facilitate expression of some, but not all, Twist-regulated genes during embryonic myogenesis. akirin mutant embryos have muscle defects consistent with altered regulation of a subset of Twist-regulated genes. To regulate transcription, Akirin colocalizes and genetically interacts with subunits of the Brahma SWI/SNF-class chromatin remodeling complex. Our results suggest that, mechanistically, Akirin mediates a novel connection between Twist and a chromatin remodeling complex to facilitate changes in the chromatin environment, leading to the optimal expression of some Twist-regulated genes during Drosophila myogenesis. We propose that this Akirin-mediated link between transcription factors and the Brahma complex represents a novel paradigm for providing tissue and target specificity for transcription factor interactions with the chromatin remodeling machinery.",2012,"Mary K Baylies, Hitoshi Aihara, Yutaka Nibu, Scott J Nowak, Katie Gonzalez"
Hedgehog-regulated ubiquitination controls smoothened trafficking and cell surface expression in Drosophila,22253574,10.1371/journal.pbio.1001239,"Hedgehog transduces signal by promoting cell surface expression of the seven-transmembrane protein Smoothened (Smo) in Drosophila, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Here we demonstrate that Smo is downregulated by ubiquitin-mediated endocytosis and degradation, and that Hh increases Smo cell surface expression by inhibiting its ubiquitination. We find that Smo is ubiquitinated at multiple Lysine residues including those in its autoinhibitory domain (SAID), leading to endocytosis and degradation of Smo by both lysosome- and proteasome-dependent mechanisms. Hh inhibits Smo ubiquitination via PKA/CK1-mediated phosphorylation of SAID, leading to Smo cell surface accumulation. Inactivation of the ubiquitin activating enzyme Uba1 or perturbation of multiple components of the endocytic machinery leads to Smo accumulation and Hh pathway activation. In addition, we find that the non-visual β-arrestin Kurtz (Krz) interacts with Smo and acts in parallel with ubiquitination to downregulate Smo. Finally, we show that Smo ubiquitination is counteracted by the deubiquitinating enzyme UBPY/USP8. Gain and loss of UBPY lead to reciprocal changes in Smo cell surface expression. Taken together, our results suggest that ubiquitination plays a key role in the downregulation of Smo to keep Hh pathway activity off in the absence of the ligand, and that Hh-induced phosphorylation promotes Smo cell surface accumulation by inhibiting its ubiquitination, which contributes to Hh pathway activation.",2012,"Jin Jiang, Yongbin Chen, Shuang Li, Qing Shi, Bing Wang, Tao Yue"
Immunolocalization of sprouty-1 and sprouty-2 in developing rat lung,22236546,10.1159/000332215,"Objective: Sprouty, a common antagonist of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and epidermal growth factor signaling, is a key player regulating tracheal branching and eye development in Drosophila. Four Sprouty homologs have been identified in vertebrates and all share a cysteine-rich region. However, the physiological function(s) of the individual Sprouty homologs is unknown. mRNA of Sprouty homologs is expressed during mouse lung development. In the present study, we investigated the immunolocalization of Sprouty proteins in rat lung at different stages of development. Methods: Rabbit antibodies were raised against peptides derived from rat Sprouty-1 and Sprouty-2 and were used in Western blot analysis to determine Sprouty distribution in subcellular fractions (pellets and supernatant centrifuged at 5,000 and 20,000 g) and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) from adult rat lungs or used in immunohistochemistry. Results: Western blot analysis revealed a 30-kDa Sprouty-1 band and a 34-kDa Sprouty-2 band in the supernatant and pellet fractions centrifuged at 20,000 g. BAL contained a band of approximately 16 kDa with Sprouty-1 antibody derived from proteolytic fragmentation of Sprouty-1. In embryonic day (E) 14 and E16 lungs, Sprouty-1 and Sprouty-2 were expressed both in epithelial and peripheral mesenchymal cells. In adult rat lung, bronchiolar and alveolar type II epithelial cells showed staining for both Sprouty-1 and Sprouty-2. Sprouty-1 expression was also seen in alveolar type I epithelial cells. Conclusion: In light of the proximity of the distribution of Sprouty to that of FGF-10 (peripheral mesenchyme) and its receptor FGFR2IIIb (distal tubular epithelium) in lung development, and the finding that FGF-9, which is expressed in mesothelial cells, upregulates FGF-10, it appears that Sprouty expression in epithelial and mesenchymal cells during branching morphogenesis is closely related to signaling by FGF-9 and FGF-10.",2012,"Hiroshi Nakano, Shuichi Hashimoto, Gurmukh Singh, Sikandar L Katyal, Yuko Suguta"
Nascent-seq indicates widespread cotranscriptional RNA editing in Drosophila,22658416,10.1016/j.molcel.2012.05.002,"The RNA editing enzyme ADAR chemically modifies adenosine (A) to inosine (I), which is interpreted by the ribosome as a guanosine. Here we assess cotranscriptional A-to-I editing in Drosophila by isolating nascent RNA from adult fly heads and subjecting samples to high throughput sequencing. There are a large number of edited sites within nascent exons. Nascent RNA from an ADAR-null strain was also sequenced, indicating that almost all A-to-I events require ADAR. Moreover, mRNA editing levels correlate with editing levels within the cognate nascent RNA sequence, indicating that the extent of editing is set cotranscriptionally. Surprisingly, the nascent data also identify an excess of intronic over exonic editing sites. These intronic sites occur preferentially within introns that are poorly spliced cotranscriptionally, suggesting a link between editing and splicing. We conclude that ADAR-mediated editing is more widespread than previously indicated and largely occurs cotranscriptionally.",2012,"Joseph Rodriguez, Michael Rosbash, Jerome S Menet"
BLD10/CEP135 is a microtubule-associated protein that controls the formation of the flagellum central microtubule pair,22898782,10.1016/j.devcel.2012.06.001,"Cilia and flagella are involved in a variety of processes and human diseases, including ciliopathies and sterility. Their motility is often controlled by a central microtubule (MT) pair localized within the ciliary MT-based skeleton, the axoneme. We characterized the formation of the motility apparatus in detail in Drosophila spermatogenesis. We show that assembly of the central MT pair starts prior to the meiotic divisions, with nucleation of a singlet MT within the basal body of a small cilium, and that the second MT of the pair only assembles much later, upon flagella formation. BLD10/CEP135, a conserved player in centriole and flagella biogenesis, can bind and stabilize MTs and is required for the early steps of central MT pair formation.

Calcium imaging of odor-evoked responses in the Drosophila antennal lobe,22453204,10.3791/2976,"The antennal lobe is the primary olfactory center in the insect brain and represents the anatomical and functional equivalent of the vertebrate olfactory bulb. Olfactory information in the external world is transmitted to the antennal lobe by olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs), which segregate to distinct regions of neuropil called glomeruli according to the specific olfactory receptor they express. Here, OSN axons synapse with both local interneurons (LNs), whose processes can innervate many different glomeruli, and projection neurons (PNs), which convey olfactory information to higher olfactory brain regions. Optical imaging of the activity of OSNs, LNs and PNs in the antennal lobe - traditionally using synthetic calcium indicators (e.g. calcium green, FURA-2) or voltage-sensitive dyes (e.g. RH414) - has long been an important technique to understand how olfactory stimuli are represented as spatial and temporal patterns of glomerular activity in many species of insects. Development of genetically-encoded neural activity reporters, such as the fluorescent calcium indicators G-CaMP and Cameleon, the bioluminescent calcium indicator GFP-aequorin, or a reporter of synaptic transmission, synapto-pHluorin has made the olfactory system of the fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster, particularly accessible to neurophysiological imaging, complementing its comprehensively-described molecular, electrophysiological and neuroanatomical properties. These reporters can be selectively expressed via binary transcriptional control systems (e.g. GAL4/UAS, LexA/LexAop, Q system) in defined populations of neurons within the olfactory circuitry to dissect with high spatial and temporal resolution how odor-evoked neural activity is represented, modulated and transformed. Here we describe the preparation and analysis methods to measure odor-evoked responses in the Drosophila antennal lobe using G-CaMP. The animal preparation is minimally invasive and can be adapted to imaging using wide-field fluorescence, confocal and two-photon microscopes.",2012,"Rati Bell, Richard Benton, Ana F Silbering, C Giovanni Galizia"
Contribution of EAG to excitability and potassium currents in Drosophila larval motoneurons,22323637,10.1152/jn.00201.2011,"Diversity in the expression of K(+) channels among neurons allows a wide range of excitability, growth, and functional regulation. Ether-à-go-go (EAG), a voltage-gated K(+) channel, was first characterized in Drosophila mutants by spontaneous firing in nerve terminals and enhanced neurotransmitter release. Although diverse functions have been ascribed to this protein, its role within neurons remains poorly understood. The aim of this study was to characterize the function of EAG in situ in Drosophila larval motoneurons. Whole cell patch-clamp recordings performed from the somata revealed a decrease in I(Av) and I(Kv) K(+) currents in eag mutants and with targeted eag RNAi expression. Spontaneous spike-like events were observed in eag mutants but absent in wild-type motoneurons. Thus our results provide evidence that EAG represents a unique K(+) channel contributing to multiple K(+) currents in motoneurons helping to regulate excitability, consistent with previous observations in the Drosophila larval muscle.",2012,"Subhashini Srinivasan, Kimberley Lance, Richard B Levine"
ArfGAP1 is a GTPase activating protein for LRRK2: reciprocal regulation of ArfGAP1 by LRRK2,22423108,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4566-11.2012,"Both sporadic and autosomal dominant forms of Parkinson's disease (PD) have been causally linked to mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), a large protein with multiple domains. The kinase domain plays an important role in LRRK2-mediated toxicity. Although a number of investigations have focused on LRRK2 kinase activity, less is known about the GTPase function of LRRK2. The activity of GTPases is regulated by GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) and GTP exchange factors. Here, we identify ArfGAP1 as the first GAP for LRRK2. ArfGAP1 binds LRRK2 predominantly via the WD40 and kinase domain of LRRK2, and it increases LRRK2 GTPase activity and regulates LRRK2 toxicity both in vitro and in vivo in Drosophila melanogaster. Unexpectedly, ArfGAP1 is an LRRK2 kinase substrate whose GAP activity is inhibited by LRRK2, whereas wild-type and G2019S LRRK2 autophosphorylation and kinase activity are significantly reduced in the presence of ArfGAP1. Overexpressed ArfGAP1 exhibits toxicity that is reduced by LRRK2 both in vitro and in vivo. Δ64-ArfGAP1, a dominant-negative ArfGAP1, and shRNA knockdown of ArfGAP1 reduce LRRK2 toxicity. Thus, LRRK2 and ArfGAP1 reciprocally regulate the activity of each other. Our results provide insight into the basic pathobiology of LRRK2 and indicate an important role for the GTPase domain and ArfGAP1 in LRRK2-mediated toxicity. These data suggest that agents targeted toward regulation of LRRK2 GTP hydrolysis might be therapeutic agents for the treatment of PD.",2012,"Valina L Dawson, Changqing Yuan, Yulan Xiong, Rong Chen, Ted M Dawson"

Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism for bluetongue virus replication and tropism,22674991,10.1128/JVI.00131-12,"Bluetongue virus (BTV) is the etiological agent of bluetongue (BT), a hemorrhagic disease of ruminants that can cause high levels of morbidity and mortality. BTV is an arbovirus transmitted between its ruminant hosts by Culicoides biting midges (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae). Recently, Europe has experienced some of the largest BT outbreaks ever recorded, including areas with no known history of the disease, leading to unprecedented economic and animal welfare issues. The current lack of genomic resources and genetic tools for Culicoides restricts any detailed study of the mechanisms involved in the virus-insect interactions. In contrast, the genome of the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) has been successfully sequenced, and it is used extensively as a model of molecular pathways due to the existence of powerful genetic technology. In this study, D. melanogaster is investigated as a model for the replication and tropism of BTV. Using reverse genetics, a modified BTV-1 that expresses the fluorescent mCherry protein fused to the viral nonstructural protein NS3 (BTV-1/NS3mCherry) was generated. We demonstrate that BTV-1/NS3mCherry is not only replication competent as it retains many characteristics of the wild-type virus but also replicates efficiently in D. melanogaster after removal of the bacterial endosymbiont Wolbachia pipientis by antibiotic treatment. Furthermore, confocal microscopy shows that the tissue tropism of BTV-1/NS3mCherry in D. melanogaster resembles that described previously for BTV in Culicoides. Overall, the data presented in this study demonstrate the feasibility of using D. melanogaster as a genetic model to investigate BTV-insect interactions that cannot be otherwise addressed in vector species.",2012,"Massimo Palmarini, Peter Mertens, Simon Carpenter, Frazer Rixon, Guillemette Maurin, Christophe Terzian, Frederick Arnaud, Eva Veronesi, Andrew E Shaw, Maxime Ratinier, Najate Ftaich, Francois Guiguen"
Gustatory receptors required for avoiding the insecticide L-canavanine,22279227,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4630-11.2012,"Insect survival depends on contact chemosensation to sense and avoid consuming plant-derived insecticides, such as L-canavanine. Members of a family of ∼60 gustatory receptors (GRs) comprise the main peripheral receptors responsible for taste sensation in Drosophila. However, the roles of most Drosophila GRs are unknown. In addition to GRs, a G protein-coupled receptor, DmXR, has been reported to be required for detecting L-canavanine. Here, we showed that GRs are essential for responding to L-canavanine and that flies missing DmXR displayed normal L-canavanine avoidance and L-canavanine-evoked action potentials. Mutations disrupting either Gr8a or Gr66a resulted in an inability to detect L-canavanine. We found that L-canavanine stimulated action potentials in S-type sensilla, which were where Gr8a and Gr66a were both expressed, but not in Gr66a-expressing sensilla that did not express Gr8a. L-canavanine-induced action potentials were also abolished in the Gr8a and Gr66a mutant animals. Gr8a was narrowly required for responding to L-canavanine, in contrast to Gr66a, which was broadly required for responding to other noxious tastants. Our data suggest that GR8a and GR66a are subunits of an L-canavanine receptor and that GR8a contributes to the specificity for L-canavanine.",2012,"Seok Jun Moon, Jaewon Shim, Youngseok Lee, Chae Uk Cheong, Min Jung Kang, Craig Montell"

The recombinant histones were efficiently assembled into periodic nucleosome arrays in a completely purified recombinant system with Drosophila ATP-utilizing chromatin assembly and remodeling factor (ACF), Drosophila nucleosome assembly protein-1, plasmid DNA, and ATP. With the Gal4-VP16 activator and a crude transcription extract, we found that the transcriptional properties of ACF-assembled chromatin containing unmodified histones were similar to those of chromatin containing native histones. We then examined ACF-catalyzed chromatin remodeling with completely purified factors and chromatin consisting of unmodified histones. In these experiments, we observed promoter-specific disruption of the regularity of nucleosome arrays upon binding of Gal4-VP16 as well as nucleosome positioning by R3 Lac repressor and subsequent nucleosome remobilization upon isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside-induced dissociation of R3 from the template.

The importance of the nkx-2.5 Smad consensus region in early cardiac gene expression was examined in transgenic mice and in cultured mouse embryos. In transgenic mice, deletion of the Smad consensus region delays induction of embryonic DeltaSmadnkx-2.5/lacZ gene expression during early heart formation. Induction of DeltaSmadnkx-2.5/lacZ expression is also delayed in the outflow tract myocardium and visceral mesoderm.

Cultured DeltaSmadnkx-2.5/lacZ transgenic mouse embryos also exhibit delayed induction of transgene expression. In the four-chambered heart, deletion of the Smad consensus region resulted in expanded DeltaSmadnkx-2.5/lacZ transgene expression.

Attractive and repulsive functions of Slit are mediated by different receptors in the Drosophila trachea,12397103,,"Oxygen delivery in many animals is enabled by the formation of unicellular capillary tubes that penetrate target tissues to facilitate gas exchange.

Robo and Robo2 are expressed in different branches, and are both necessary for the correct orientation of branch outgrowth. At the CNS midline, Slit functions as a repellent for tracheal branches and this function is mediated primarily by Robo. Robo2 is necessary for the tracheal response to the attractive Slit signal and its function is antagonized by Robo.

We mapped the ear gene to cytological region 88E11-13, near easter, and showed that it is deleted by Df(3R)ea(5022rx1), a small, cytologically invisible deletion. Annotation of the completed Drosophila genome sequence suggests that this region might contain as many as 26 genes, most of which, including ear, are not represented by mutant alleles. We carried out a large-scale noncomplementation screen using Df(3R)ea(5022rx1) and chemical (EMS) mutagenesis from which we identified seven novel multi-allele recessive lethal complementation groups in this region. An overlapping deficiency, Df(3R)Po(4), allowed us to map several of these groups to either the proximal or the distal regions of Df(3R)ea(5022rx1). One of these complementation groups likely corresponds to the ear gene as judged by map location, terminal phenotype, and reduction of EAR protein levels.",2002,"Andrew K Dingwall, Yun Feng, Claudia B Zraly"
"The interaction between the coactivator dCBP and Modulo, a chromatin-associated factor, affects segmentation and melanotic tumor formation in Drosophila",11854460,10.1073/pnas.052509799,"The development of Drosophila requires the function of the CREB-binding protein, dCBP. In flies, dCBP serves as a coactivator for the transcription factors Cubitus interruptus, Dorsal, and Mad, and as a cosuppressor of Drosophila T cell factor. Current models propose that CBP, through its intrinsic and associated histone acetyltransferase activities, affects transient chromatin changes that allow the preinitiation complex to access the promoter. In this report, we provide evidence that dCBP may regulate the formation of chromatin states through interactions with the modulo (mod) gene product, a protein that is thought to be involved in chromatin packaging. We demonstrate that dCBP and Modulo bind in vitro and in vivo, that mutations in mod enhance the embryonic phenotype of a dCBP mutation, and that dCBP mutations enhance the melanotic tumor phenotype characteristic of mod homozygous mutants. These results imply that, in addition to its histone acetyltransferase activity, dCBP may affect higher-order chromatin structure.",2002,"Frédéric Bantignies, Richard H Goodman, Sarah M Smolik"
Bicoid associates with the 5'-cap-bound complex of caudal mRNA and represses translation,12368268,10.1101/gad.240002,"Translational control plays a key role in many biological processes including pattern formation during early Drosophila embryogenesis. In this process, the anterior determinant Bicoid (BCD) acts not only as a transcriptional activator of segmentation genes but also causes specific translational repression of ubiquitously distributed caudal (cad) mRNA in the anterior region of the embryo. We show that translational repression of cad mRNA is dependent on a functional eIF4E-binding motif. The results suggest a novel mode of translational repression, which combines the strategy of target-specific binding to 3'-untranslated sequences and interference with 5'-cap-dependent translation initiation in one protein.",2002,"Dierk Niessing, Herbert Jäckle, Stephen Blanke"
Keeping a good pathway down: transcriptional repression of Notch pathway target genes by CSL proteins,12223465,10.1093/embo-reports/kvf170,"CSL [CBF-1, Su(H), Lag-1]-type transcription factors are the primary effectors of the Notch pathway, a signal transduction cascade that is essential for the development of all metazoan organisms. Interestingly, CSL proteins were originally classified as transcriptional repressors in vertebrates, but as transcriptional activators in model invertebrate organisms. Resolution of this paradox came with the realization that repression and activation by CSL proteins occurs in both systems and that the switch involves recruitment of distinct co-repressor and co-activator complexes. Although CSL proteins appear to utilize a common co-activator complex of largely similar constitution, recent studies have demonstrated that vertebrate and Drosophila CSL interact with a variety of distinct co-repressor complexes. This review highlights differences in composition and similarities in function of different CSL co-repressor complexes, which actively repress Notch pathway target genes in the absence of Notch pathway activity.",2002,Eric C Lai
Identification of cis elements which direct the localization of maternal mRNAs to the posterior pole of ascidian embryos,12297101,10.1006/dbio.2002.0783,"During ascidian embryogenesis, some mRNAs show clear localization at the posterior-most region. These postplasmic mRNAs are divided into two groups (type I and type II) according to their pattern of localization. To elucidate how these localization patterns are achieved, we attempted to identify the localization elements of these mRNAs. When in vitro synthesized postplasmic mRNAs were introduced into eggs, these mRNAs showed posterior localization similar to the endogenous mRNAs. The posterior localization of these mRNAs was mediated by their 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs), as is the case for several localized Drosophila and Xenopus mRNAs. We identified smaller fragments of the 3' UTRs of HrWnt-5 and HrPOPK-1 mRNAs (type I) and HrPet-3 mRNA (type II) that were sufficient to direct green fluorescent protein mRNA to the posterior pole. For the localization of HrWnt-5 mRNA, two UG dinucleotide repetitive elements were essential. Motifs similar to these small elements also exist within the HrPOPK-1 mRNA localization element and 3' UTR of HrZF-1 mRNA, suggesting the conservation of localization elements among type I mRNAs. In contrast, the smallest sequence that suffices for the posterior localization of HrPet-3 (a type II mRNA) has different features from those of type I mRNAs; indeed, it does not have an identifiable critical element. This difference may distinguish type II mRNAs from type I mRNAs. These findings, especially the identification of the small localization element of HrWnt-5 mRNA, provide new insights into the localization of mRNAs during ascidian embryogenesis.",2002,"Yasunori Sasakura, Kazuhiro W Makabe"
The DIAP1 RING finger mediates ubiquitination of Dronc and is indispensable for regulating apoptosis,12021771,10.1038/ncb799,"Members of the Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein (IAP) family block activation of the intrinsic cell death machinery by binding to and neutralizing the activity of pro-apoptotic caspases. In Drosophila melanogaster, the pro-apoptotic proteins Reaper (Rpr), Grim and Hid (head involution defective) all induce cell death by antagonizing the anti-apoptotic activity of Drosophila IAP1 (DIAP1), thereby liberating caspases. Here, we show that in vivo, the RING finger of DIAP1 is essential for the regulation of apoptosis induced by Rpr, Hid and Dronc. Furthermore, we show that the RING finger of DIAP1 promotes the ubiquitination of both itself and of Dronc. Disruption of the DIAP1 RING finger does not inhibit its binding to Rpr, Hid or Dronc, but completely abrogates ubiquitination of Dronc.

"Genomic imprinting in Drosophila is maintained by the products of Suppressor of variegation and trithorax group, but not Polycomb group, genes",12242505,10.1007/s00438-002-0731-0,"Genomic imprinting is a form of epigenetic inheritance that is characterized by differential expression of a gene depending on its parental origin. The mini-X chromosome Dp(1;f)LJ9 in Drosophila shows this type of classical imprinting; when transmitted by the maternal parent genes on this chromosome are fully expressed, but when the chromosome is transmitted by the male parent at least three genes are subject to silencing, resulting in a variegated expression pattern. Chemical and environmental modifiers of position-effect variegation have been shown to alter the somatic maintenance of the imprint. To extend these observations, several mutations in chromatin-associated proteins were examined for their effect on imprinting on the Dp(1;f)LJ9 mini-X chromosome. Effects on establishment and maintenance were independently assessed by genetically associating the mutations in chromatin modifiers with the mini-X chromosome in either the parents, where the imprint is established, or the progeny, in which the imprint must be maintained. Nine Suppressor of variegation [ Su(var)] mutations, including alleles of the Su(var)2-5 gene, which encodes the well characterized heterochromatin-associated protein HP1, abolished maintenance but not the establishment of the imprint. Mutant alleles of two genes in the trithorax group ( trx-G), brahma and trithorax, showed a maternal-effect enhancement of the paternal imprint. Surprisingly, however, with the exception of an Enhancer of Polycomb [ E(Pc)] allele, none of the Polycomb-group ( Pc-G) mutations tested affected the imprint. Thus, the maintenance of this imprint relies on the wild-type products of Su(var) and trx-G, but not Pc-G, genes. Finally, none of the mutations tested affected the maintenance of the maternal imprint or the establishment of either the maternal or paternal imprint, suggesting that the maternal and paternal imprints depend on different molecular processes and that imprint establishment and maintenance are independently regulated.",2002,"V K Lloyd, V Joanis"
The odorant-binding proteins of Drosophila melanogaster: annotation and characterization of a divergent gene family,12119098,10.1016/s0378-1119(02)00672-8,"Insect odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) are thought to facilitate the delivery of hydrophobic odorants, such as sex pheromones or food odors, to receptors on sensory neurons. Increasingly, OBP family members are also being found in non-sensory tissues where they might carry other types of small hydrophobic molecules. They are identifiable by four or six conserved Cys residues and contain six alpha-helices which enclose a hydrophobic ligand-binding pocket. Through exhaustive BLAST searches we have increased the total number of OBPs identified in Drosophila melanogaster to 38, and have amplified the DNA complementary to RNA corresponding to 21 of these by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Isoforms frequently share less than 30% amino acid identity and appear to have radically changed since the separation of the major insect orders. However, their sequences are consistent with known OBP structures. Most are located in clusters of between four and 14 genes and several were unusual in that they contained additions, deletions, or fusions. These hexa-helical insect OBPs are structurally unrelated to the functionally analogous lipocalin-like beta-barrel OBPs of vertebrates. As only two lipocalin-like proteins have been found in D. melanogaster, these helical proteins appear to be the dominant carrier of small hydrophobic molecules in insects.",2002,"Laurie A Graham, Peter L Davies"
The Drosophila gap junction channel gene innexin 2 controls foregut development in response to Wingless signalling,11956317,,"In invertebrates, the direct communication of neighbouring cells is mediated by gap junctions, which are composed of oligomers of the innexin family of transmembrane proteins. Studies of the few known innexin mutants in Drosophila and C. elegans have shown that innexin proteins, which are structurally analogous to the connexins in vertebrates, play a major structural role as gap junctional core components in electric signal transmission. We show that Drosophila innexin 2 mutants display a feeding defect that originates from a failure of epithelial cells to migrate and invaginate during proventriculus organogenesis. The proventriculus is a valve-like organ that regulates food passage from the foregut into the midgut. Immunohistological studies indicate that innexin 2 is functionally required to establish a primordial structure of the proventriculus, the keyhole, during the regionalisation of the embryonic foregut tube, which is under the control of Wingless and Hedgehog signalling. Our genetic lack- and gain-of-function studies, and experiments in Dorsophila tissue culture cells provide strong evidence that innexin 2 is a target gene of Wingless signalling in the proventricular cells. This is the first evidence, to our knowledge, that an invertebrate gap junction gene controls epithelial tissue and organ morphogenesis in response to the conserved WNT signalling cascade.",2002,"Bernhard Fuss, Corinna Lehmann, Franka Eckardt, Reinhard Bauer, Michael Hoch"

Because these similarities extend to the genetic and molecular level, Drosophila has become a fruitful model to study control mechanisms of early heart development. Herein we summarize recently obtained insights into control mechanisms during early induction and diversification of cardiac progenitors in Drosophila. We also show that induction of tinman, a key cardiogenic gene, in the dorsal mesoderm by Dpp (Drosophila BMP) involves protein/protein interactions between Tinman and the Smad proteins Mad and Medea, in addition to their DNA-binding activities to specific tinman enhancer sequences. Furthermore, we present evidence that binding of a high-mobility-group protein, HMG-D, to the Dpp-responsive enhancer of tinman as well as to the Tinman protein may be involved in the formation of a fully active enhancer complex.",2002,"X Xu, H H Lee, M Frasch, S Zaffran, P C Lo"
One of the two cytoplasmic actin isoforms in Drosophila is essential,12034866,10.1073/pnas.082235499,"Actin is a highly conserved protein found in all eukaryotic organisms. Most organisms have multiple cytoplasmic actin genes that encode isoforms with slightly different amino acid sequences. These different isoforms are coexpressed in many cell types. Why organisms have multiple very similar cytoplasmic actin genes is unclear. We have addressed this question with the cytoplasmic actins in Drosophila, Act5C, and Act42A. These isoforms differ by only two amino acids and both genes are expressed in all cells at all times during development. We identified P element insertions in the Act5C gene that resulted in a lethal phenotype. The lethal phenotype is rescued by a transgene with a genomic fragment that includes Act5C regulatory and amino acid coding sequences. A hybrid transgene containing the protein coding sequence for the Act42A isoform, under the control of the regulatory regions of the Act5C gene, also rescues the lethality of the Act5C mutants. Furthermore, flies that carry only one copy each of Act5C and Act42A are viable. These results suggest the amino acid differences between these two cytoplasmic actin isoforms are not important for function and the need for increased gene dosage to provide more actin is not likely to explain the existence of multiple genes. Instead, our results suggest that regulated expression of Act5C is essential to the fly.",2002,"Kathryn G Miller, Cynthia R Wagner, Anthony P Mahowald"

However, little is known about molecular basis of the 3.8-kb cDNA. Genomic and RNA analyses have shown that Edr2 locates on Chromosome 4 as a single copy gene and is transcribed into at least two transcript isoforms about 3.0 and 4.4 kb in length, most likely corresponding to the 2.5- and 3.8-kb cDNAs, respectively. The largest open reading frames in the 2.5- and 3.8-kb cDNAs encode 36- and 90-kDa polypeptides, respectively. The 36-kDa protein is a truncated form lacking of the N-terminal region of the 90-kDa protein. Interestingly, it has been demonstrated that the 3.0-kb mRNA accumulates at a much higher level than the 3.8-kb mRNA in mouse embryos and mature tissues. Immunostaining assay of mammalian cells has shown that the 36-kDa form tagged with HA colocalizes with the other PcG protein Mel18 in nuclei, suggesting that the smaller protein is capable of forming maltimeric complex with other PcG proteins.

Very recently, several examples, including the Schizosaccharomyces pombe mating-type region, chicken beta-globin locus, and inactive X-chromosome, revealed that H3-Lys9-methyl (Me) is associated with silent chromatin while H3-Lys4-Me is prominent in active chromatin. Surprisingly, it was shown that homologs of Drosophila Su(var)3-9 specifically methylate the Lys9 residue of histone H3. Here, to identify putative enzymes responsible for destabilization of heterochromatin, we screened genes whose overexpressions disrupt silencing at the silent mat3 locus in fission yeast. Interestingly, we identified two genes, rhp6(+) and ubcX(+) (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme participating in silencing), both of which encode ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes. Their overexpression disrupted silencing at centromeres and telomeres as well as at mat3. Additionally, the overexpression interfered with centromeric function, as confirmed by elevated minichromosome loss and antimicrotubule drug sensitivity. On the contrary, deletion of rhp6(+) or ubcX(+) enhanced silencing at all heterochromatic regions tested, indicating that they are negative regulators of silencing. More importantly, chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that their overexpression alleviated the level of H3-Lys9-Me while enhancing the level of H3-Lys4-Me at the silent regions. On the contrary, their deletions enhanced the level of H3-Lys9-Me while alleviating that of H3-Lys4-Me.

A nucleotide sequence analysis of the 3.5 kilobase sequence of the alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) region from 139 Drosophila pseudoobscura strains and one D. miranda strain was used to determine whether positive or negative selection acts on indel variation in a gene that experiences high levels of recombination. A total of 30 deletion and 36 insertion polymorphisms were segregating within D. pseudoobscura populations and no indels were fixed between D. pseudoobscura and its two sibling species D. miranda and D. persimilis. The ratio of Tajima's D to its theoretical minimum value (D(min)) was proposed as a metric to assess the heterogeneity in D among D. pseudoobscura loci when the number of segregating sites differs among loci. The magnitude of the D/D(min) ratio was found to increase as the rate of population expansion increases, allowing one to assess which loci have an excess of rare variants due to population expansion versus purifying selection. D. pseudoobscura populations appear to have had modest increases in size accounting for some of the observed excess of rare variants. The D/D(min) ratio rejected a neutral model for deletion polymorphisms. Linkage disequilibrium among pairs of indels was greater than between pairs of segregating nucleotides. These results suggest that purifying selection removes deletion variation from intron sequences, but not insertion polymorphisms.

This effect requires Fos-dependent transcriptional activation of a matrix metalloprotease gene mmp1 downstream of JNK. Expression of the Mmp inhibitor Timp or Mmp RNAi knockdown suppresses cell invasiveness. The proinvasive function of the JNK pathway is revealed in a tumor context when active Ras signaling prevents the apoptotic response to JNK activity as it occurs in nontransformed cells.

Transgene-like animal models using intronic microRNAs,16957386,10.1385/1-59745-123-1:321,"Transgenic animal models are valuable tools for testing gene functions and drug mechanisms in vivo. They are also the best similitude of a human body for etiological and pathological research of diseases. All pharmaceutically developed drugs must be proven safe and effective in animals before approval by the Food and Drug Administration to be used in clinical trials. To this end, the transgenic animal models of human diseases serve as a front line for drug evaluation. However, there is currently no transgenic animal model for microRNA (miRNA) research. miRNAs, small single-stranded regulatory RNAs capable of silencing intracellular gene transcripts that contain either complete or partial complementarity to the miRNAs, are useful for the design and development of new therapies against cancer polymorphism and viral mutation. Recently, varieties of natural miRNAs have been found to be derived from hairpin-like RNA precursors in almost all eukaryotes, including yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe), plant (Arabidopsis), nematode (Caenorhabditis elegans), fly (Drosophila melanogaster), fish, mouse, and human, involving intracellular defense against viral infections and regulation of certain gene expressions during development. To facilitate the miRNA research in vivo, we have developed a state-of-the-art transgenic strategy for silencing specific genes in zebrafish, chicken, and mouse, using intronic miRNAs. By insertion of a hairpin-like pre-miRNA structure into the intron region of a gene, we have found that mature miRNAs were successfully transcribed by RNA polymerase (Pol)-II, coexpressed with the encoding gene transcript, and excised out of the encoding gene transcript by natural RNA splicing and processing mechanisms. In conjunction with retroviral transfection systems, the hairpin-like pre-miRNA construct was further inserted into the intron of a cellular gene for tissue-specific expression regulated by the gene promoter. Because the retroviral vectors were randomly integrated into the genome of its host cell, the most effective transgenic animal can be selected and propagated to be a stable transgenic line for future research.

In addition, one of these SUV39H1-binding motifs is also sufficient for binding to histone deacetylases 1 and 3, and both of these domains are required for full RUNX1-mediated transcriptional repression.

Unexpectedly, the canonical NF-kappaB signaling pathway is not functional in the immune system of Caenorhabditis elegans. Therefore, the ancient origin of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway is still unknown. Here, we report the discovery and characterization of a primitive and functional NF-kappaB/IkappaB pathway in the immune defense of a ""living fossil,"" the horseshoe crab, Carcinoscorpius rotundicauda. The ancient NF-kappaB/IkappaB homologues, CrNFkappaB, CrRelish, and CrIkappaB, share numerous signature motifs with their vertebrate orthologues. CrNFkappaB recognizes both horseshoe crab and mammalian kappaB response elements. CrIkappaB interacts with CrNFkappaB and inhibits its nuclear translocation and DNA-binding activity. The activation of the CrNFkappaB is autoregulated by a feedback mechanism mediated by CrIkappaB, the natural inhibitor of CrNFkappaB. We further show that Gram-negative bacteria infection causes rapid degradation of CrIkappaB and nuclear translocation of CrNFkappaB. Infection also leads to an increase in the kappaB-binding activity and up-regulation of immune-related gene expression, like inducible nitric oxide synthase and Factor C, an LPS-activated serine protease. Altogether, our study shows that, although absent in C. elegans, the NF-kappaB/IkappaB signaling cascade remains well conserved from horseshoe crab to humans, playing an archaic but fundamental role in regulating the expression of critical immune defense molecules.",2006,"Nguan Soon Tan, Bow Ho, Jeak Ling Ding, Xiao Wei Wang"
C2B polylysine motif of synaptotagmin facilitates a Ca2+-independent stage of synaptic vesicle priming in vivo,16987956,10.1091/mbc.e06-07-0622,"Synaptotagmin I, a synaptic vesicle protein required for efficient synaptic transmission, contains a highly conserved polylysine motif necessary for function. Using Drosophila, we examined in which step of the synaptic vesicle cycle this motif functions. Polylysine motif mutants exhibited an apparent decreased Ca2+ affinity of release, and, at low Ca2+, an increased failure rate, increased facilitation, and increased augmentation, indicative of a decreased release probability. Disruption of Ca2+ binding, however, cannot account for all of the deficits in the mutants; rather, the decreased release probability is probably due to a disruption in the coupling of synaptotagmin to the release machinery. Mutants exhibited a major slowing of recovery from synaptic depression, which suggests that membrane trafficking before fusion is disrupted. The disrupted process is not endocytosis because the rate of FM 1-43 uptake was unchanged in the mutants, and the polylysine motif mutant synaptotagmin was able to rescue the synaptic vesicle depletion normally found in syt(null) mutants. Thus, the polylysine motif functions after endocytosis and before fusion. Finally, mutation of the polylysine motif inhibits the Ca2+-independent ability of synaptotagmin to accelerate SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor)-mediated fusion. Together, our results demonstrate that the polylysine motif is required for efficient Ca2+-independent docking and/or priming of synaptic vesicles in vivo.",2006,"Yeon-Kyun Shin, Carin A Loewen, Noreen E Reist, Soo-Min Lee"
Oct2 transcription factors in fish--a comparative genomic analysis,15939624,10.1016/j.fsi.2005.01.011,"The Oct2 transcription factor is important in driving expression of the IgH locus of the channel catfish, Ictalurus punctatus. Two isoforms, catfish Oct2alpha and Oct2beta, have been characterized at the level of expression and function, but little is known of the structure of the Oct2 gene in catfish. To gain insight into the diversity of Oct2 gene structure and expression in the teleost fish, a comparative genomic analysis of Oct2 was undertaken in the pufferfish (Fugu rubripes) and the zebrafish (Danio rerio). The orthologues of zebrafish and Fugu Oct2 were identified, and share with catfish Oct2 the expression of a limited number (two in zebrafish, three in Fugu) of isotypes produced by alternative pathways of RNA processing. The alternatively spliced variants of catfish Oct2 showed a different pattern of exon use from those of Fugu and zebrafish. The analysis also identified a novel homologue of Oct2 in both zebrafish and Fugu. This homologue, termed Oct2x, shares similarities to both Oct1 and Oct2. A phylogenetic analysis of the relationships of Oct2x gave an unexpected result, with Oct2x occupying a position basal to the Oct gene families of both vertebrates and Drosophila.",2006,"Mara L Lennard, Melanie R Wilson, L William Clem, Gregory W Warr, Norman W Miller, Jun-ichi Hikima"
Expression of 18-wheeler in the follicle cell epithelium affects cell migration and egg morphology in Drosophila,16607637,10.1002/dvdy.20820,"The Drosophila ovary is a model system for examining the genetic control of epithelial morphogenesis. The somatic follicle cells form a polarized epithelium surrounding the 16-cell germ line cyst. The integrity of this epithelium is essential for the successful completion of oogenesis. Reciprocal signaling between germ line and somatic cells establishes embryonic and eggshell polarity. The follicle cells are responsible for shaping the egg and secreting the eggshell. Follicle cells at the boundary between the nurse cells and the oocyte migrate centripetally to cover the anterior end of the oocyte and secrete the operculum. Dorsal anterior main body follicle cells undergo elaborate patterning to produce the dorsal appendages. We have examined the expression of the Toll-like receptor, 18-wheeler (18w), in the ovary and find it to be restricted to subpopulations of follicle cells. Females carrying loss-of-function 18w mutant clones in their ovaries show delayed follicle cell migrations. The eggs laid by such females also show morphological defects in egg shape and dorsal appendage morphology. We propose that the 18W protein plays an adhesive or signaling role in regions of the epithelium engaged in cell migration.",2006,"Samreen K Syed, Dominic A Siler, Cassandra D Kleve, Elizabeth D Eldon"
ROBO directs axon crossing of segmental boundaries by suppressing responsiveness to relocalized Netrin,16341212,10.1038/nn1612,"Networks in the CNS consist of neural modules that are connected in a repetitive array. Whereas individual modules contain guidance information along which axons track within the unit, these guidance cues hinder axon extension across module boundaries. We investigated how axons solve this 'boundary problem' by analyzing the longitudinal connections of neuromeres in Drosophila melanogaster. The initial trajectory of the longitudinal axons is guided by Netrin, which is localized on commissural axons by its receptor, Frazzled. The Netrin cue on the commissure of the next segment can act as a barrier to longitudinal axons, inhibiting their extension and misguiding them contralaterally along the commissure. We show that, before reaching the segmental boundary, the longitudinal axons' responsiveness to Netrin presented on the commissure is suppressed by Roundabout (ROBO), through counteracting Gq signaling. The absence of suppression causes the robo phenotype: longitudinal axons project toward the midline, as if running around a roundabout (rotary).",2006,"Masaki Hiramoto, Yasushi Hiromi"
Testing hypotheses for the functions of APC family proteins using null and truncation alleles in Drosophila,16720878,10.1242/dev.02398,"Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) is mutated in colon cancers. During normal development, APC proteins are essential negative regulators of Wnt signaling and have cytoskeletal functions. Many functions have been proposed for APC proteins, but these have often rested on dominant-negative or partial loss-of-function approaches. Thus, despite intense interest in APC, significant questions remain about its full range of cellular functions and about how mutations in the gene affect these. We isolated six new alleles of Drosophila APC2. Two resemble the truncation alleles found in human tumors and one is a protein null. We generated ovaries and embryos null for both APC2 and APC1, and assessed the consequences of total loss of APC function, allowing us to test several previous hypotheses. Surprisingly, although complete loss of APC1 and APC2 resulted in strong activation of Wingless signaling, it did not substantially alter cell viability, cadherin-based adhesion, spindle morphology, orientation or selection of division plane, as predicted from previous studies. We also tested the hypothesis that truncated APC proteins found in tumors are dominant negative. Two mutant proteins have dominant effects on cytoskeletal regulation, affecting Wnt-independent nuclear retention in syncytial embryos. However, they do not have dominant-negative effects on Wnt signaling.",2006,"Brooke M McCartney, Melissa A Hayden, Rebecca L Webb, Meredith H Price, Lesley M Holot, Mark Peifer, Amy Bejsovec, Mengning Zhou"

FaRPs and serotonin (5-HT) each affect the frequency of D. melanogaster heart contractions in vivo. We examined the cellular expression of FaRPs and 5-HT, and the activities of FMRFamide, SDNFMRFamide, PDNFMRFamide, or DMS and 5-HT on heart rate. FaRPs and 5-HT were not co-localized; FaRP-and 5-HT-immunoreactive fibers extended from different brain cells and innervated the anterior D. melanogaster dorsal vessel. However, no neuron expressed both a FaRP and 5-HT. The effect of FMRFamide and 5-HT was not different from the effect of 5-HT alone on heart rate. The effect of PDNFMRFamide and 5-HT showed an additive effect on heart rate. SDNFMRFamide and 5-HT or DMS and 5-HT resulted in non-additive effects on heart rate. Our data provide evidence for the complexity of FaRP and 5-HT interactions to regulate frequency of heart contractions in vivo.

Genomic organization and functional characterization of the alcohol dehydrogenase locus of Ceratitis capitata (Medfly),16756545,10.1111/j.1365-2583.2006.00642.x,"Approximately 30 kb of genomic DNA enclosing the Adh locus from the medfly, Ceratitis capitata have been cloned and about 15 kb has been structurally and functionally characterized. The locus consists of two genes, Adh-1 and Adh-2, separated by an intergenic region, which is polymorphic in size ranging from approximately 6.4 kb to 8.1 kb. Both genes consist of three exons and two introns. The introns are below 200 bp in size, except the 1st intron of Adh-1, which is unexpectedly long, variable in size and contains a deleted mariner-like element (postdoc). The two genes are transcribed in different orientations. The Adh-2 gene shows the typical pattern of transcription seen in the homologous genes of Drosophilidae presenting high levels of expression in the fat body, gut and ovaries. The Adh-1 gene is only expressed in the body muscle tissues of embryos, larvae and adult flies, raising the question of what its biological function may be. A DNA fragment containing bases -102 to -1666 relative to the first base of the initiating ATG of Adh-1 is sufficient to drive the expression of a reporter gene in body muscles of Drosophila melanogaster embryos, larvae and adult flies.

One of these microRNAs, miR-1, is among the most widely conserved microRNAs during evolution. Genetic inactivation of miR-1 in Drosophila has shown that miR-1 is essential for maintaining the development and integrity of body wall muscles during phases of rapid growth, whereas it is not needed for normal mesoderm patterning and muscle specification. Expression analysis of a large set of potential miR-1 target mRNAs has revealed that these mRNAs tend to be expressed in non-muscle tissues, in patterns that are mutually exclusive with miR-1. Together, these findings lend support to the hypothesis that miR-1 exerts 'quality control' during muscle development by blocking detrimental mRNAs that are promiscuously expressed. Other miRNAs might promote specific developmental switches during the development and regeneration of muscles.",2006,"Hanh T Nguyen, Manfred Frasch"

DNA binding properties of TAF1 isoforms with two AT-hooks,16893881,10.1074/jbc.M606289200,"TATA-binding protein-associated factor 1 (TAF1) is an essential component of the general transcription factor IID (TFIID), which nucleates assembly of the preinitiation complex for transcription by RNA polymerase II. TATA-binding protein and TAF1.TAF2 heterodimers are the only components of TFIID shown to bind specific DNA sequences (the TATA box and initiator, respectively), raising the question of how TFIID localizes to gene promoters that lack binding sites for these proteins. Here we demonstrate that Drosophila TAF1 protein isoforms TAF1-2 and TAF1-4 directly bind DNA independently of TAF2. DNA binding by TAF1 isoforms is mediated by cooperative interactions of two identical AT-hook motifs, one of which is encoded by an alternatively spliced exon. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that TAF1-2 bound the minor groove of adenine-thymine-rich DNA with a preference for the sequence AAT. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the alternatively spliced AT-hook indicated that Lys and Arg residues made essential DNA contacts, whereas Gly and Pro residues within the Arg-Gly-Arg-Pro core sequence were less important for DNA binding, suggesting that AT-hooks are more divergent than previously predicted. TAF1-2 bound with variable affinity to the transcription start site of several Drosophila genes, and binding to the hsp70 promoter was reduced by mutation of a single base pair at the transcription start site. Collectively, these data indicate that AT-hooks serve to anchor TAF1 isoforms to the minor groove of adenine-thymine-rich Drosophila gene promoters and suggest a model in which regulated expression of TAF1 isoforms by alternative splicing contributes to gene-specific transcription.",2006,"Chad E Metcalf, David A Wassarman"
Multiple EGFR ligands participate in guiding migrating border cells,16712835,10.1016/j.ydbio.2006.04.438,"Cell migration is an important feature of embryonic development as well as tumor metastasis. Border cells in the Drosophila ovary have emerged as a useful in vivo model for uncovering the molecular mechanisms that control many aspects of cell migration including guidance. It was previously shown that two receptor tyrosine kinases, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and PDGF- and VEGF-related receptor (PVR), together contribute to border cell migration. Whereas the ligand for PVR, PVF1, is known to guide border cells, it is unclear which of the four activating EGFR ligands function in this process. We developed an assay to detect the ability of secreted factors to reroute migrating border cells in vivo and tested the activity of EGFR ligands compared to PVF1. Two ligands, Keren and Spitz, guided border cells whereas the other ligands, Gurken and Vein, did not. In addition, only Keren and Spitz were expressed at the appropriate stage in the oocyte, the target of border cell migration.

Highwire restrains synaptic growth by attenuating a MAP kinase signal,16815332,10.1016/j.neuron.2006.05.026,"Highwire is an extremely large, evolutionarily conserved E3 ubiquitin ligase that negatively regulates synaptic growth at the Drosophila NMJ.

A screen for suppressors of the highwire synaptic overgrowth phenotype yielded mutations in wallenda, a MAP kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK) homologous to vertebrate DLK and LZK. wallenda is both necessary for highwire synaptic overgrowth and sufficient to promote synaptic overgrowth, and synaptic levels of Wallenda protein are controlled by Highwire and ubiquitin hydrolases. highwire synaptic overgrowth requires the MAP kinase JNK and the transcription factor Fos. These results suggest that Highwire controls structural plasticity of the synapse by regulating gene expression through a MAP kinase signaling pathway.

Dorsal-ventral pattern of Delta trafficking is established by a Snail-Tom-Neuralized pathway,16459304,10.1016/j.devcel.2006.01.011,The intracellular trafficking of the Notch ligand Delta plays an important role in the activation of the Notch pathway. We have addressed the snail-dependent regulation of Delta trafficking during the plasma membrane growth of the mesoderm in the Drosophila embryo. We show that Delta is retained in endocytic vesicles in the mesoderm but expressed on the surface of the adjacent ectoderm. This trafficking pattern requires Neuralized. We developed a protocol based on chromosomal deletion and microarray analysis that led to the identification of tom as the target of snail regulating Delta trafficking. Snail represses Tom expression in the mesoderm and thereby activates Delta trafficking. Overexpression of Tom abolishes Delta trafficking and signaling to the adjacent mesoectoderm. Loss of Tom produces mesoderm-type Delta trafficking in the entire blastoderm epithelium and an expansion of mesoectoderm gene expression. We propose that Tom antagonizes the activity of Neuralized and thus establishes a sharp mesoderm-mesoectoderm boundary of Notch signaling.,2006,"J Yu, Eric Wieschaus, R Zinzen, Stefano De Renzis"
"Seizure suppression by shakB2, a gap junction mutation in Drosophila",16192342,10.1152/jn.01059.2004,"Gap junction proteins mediate electrical synaptic transmission. In Drosophila, flies carrying null mutations in the shakB locus, such as shakB2, have behavioral and electrophysiological defects in the giant fiber (GF) system neurocircuit consistent with a loss of transmission at electrical synapses. The shakB2 mutation also affects seizure susceptibility. Mutant flies are especially seizure-resistant and have a high threshold to evoked seizures. In addition, in some double mutant combinations with ""epilepsy"" mutations, shakB2 appears to act as a seizure-suppressor mutation: shakB2 restores seizure susceptibility to the wild-type range in the double mutant. In double mutant combinations, shakB2 completely suppresses seizures caused by slamdance (sda), knockdown (kdn), and jitterbug (jbug) mutations. Seizures caused by easily shocked (eas) and technical knockout (tko) mutations are partially suppressed by shakB2. Seizures caused by bang-sensitive (bas2) and bang-senseless (bss1, bss2 alleles) mutations are not suppressed by shakB2.

Our study presents a comprehensive model of cellular remodeling and proliferation in the dorsal branches of third-instar Drosophila larvae. Through a combination of immunostaining and novel live imaging techniques, we identify the key steps in the transition from a unicellular to a multicellular tube. Junctional remodeling precedes mitosis and, as the cells divide, new junctions are formed through several variations of what we refer to as 'asymmetric cytokinesis'. Depending on the spacing of cells along the dorsal branch, mitosis can occur either before or after the transition to a multicellular tube. In both instances, cell separation is accomplished through asymmetric cytokinesis, a process that is initiated by the ingression of the cytokinetic ring. Unequal cell compartments are a possible but rare outcome of completing mitosis through this mechanism. We also found that the Dpp signaling pathway is required but not sufficient for cell division in the dorsal branches.",2015,"Alexandru Stefan Denes, Oguz Kanca, Markus Affolter"

Relative to the whole genome, genes functioning in amino acid metabolism are significantly over-represented among the pea aphid orthologues of Malpighian tubule genes, likely reflecting the central importance of amino acid acquisition and metabolism in aphids.

MIA also calculates Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) between pair of different species spectra, herein called informational distances. Thus, the resulting distance matrices can be presented by distance histograms and informational dendrograms, giving support to discrimination of closely related species. Results: In order to test MIA we analyzed sequences from Drosophila Adh locus, because the taxonomy and evolutionary patterns of different Drosophila species are well established and the gene Adh is extensively studied. The search retrieved 959 sequences of 291 species. From the total, 450 sequences of 17 species were selected. With this dataset MIA performed all tasks in less than three hours: gathering, storing and aligning fasta files; calculating VH, VMI and HMI spectra; and calculating JSD between pair of different species spectra. For each task MIA saved tables and graphics in the local disk, easily accessible for future analysis. Conclusions: Our tests revealed that the ""informational model free"" spectra may represent species signatures.

Mycalolide B dissociates dynactin and abolishes retrograde axonal transport of dense-core vesicles,26023088,10.1091/mbc.E14-11-1564,"Axonal transport is critical for maintaining synaptic transmission. Of interest, anterograde and retrograde axonal transport appear to be interdependent, as perturbing one directional motor often impairs movement in the opposite direction. Here live imaging of Drosophila and hippocampal neuron dense-core vesicles (DCVs) containing a neuropeptide or brain-derived neurotrophic factor shows that the F-actin depolymerizing macrolide toxin mycalolide B (MB) rapidly and selectively abolishes retrograde, but not anterograde, transport in the axon and the nerve terminal. Latrunculin A does not mimic MB, demonstrating that F-actin depolymerization is not responsible for unidirectional transport inhibition. Given that dynactin initiates retrograde transport and that amino acid sequences implicated in macrolide toxin binding are found in the dynactin component actin-related protein 1, we examined dynactin integrity. Remarkably, cell extract and purified protein experiments show that MB induces disassembly of the dynactin complex. Thus imaging selective retrograde transport inhibition led to the discovery of a small-molecule dynactin disruptor. The rapid unidirectional inhibition by MB suggests that dynactin is absolutely required for retrograde DCV transport but does not directly facilitate ongoing anterograde DCV transport in the axon or nerve terminal. More generally, MB's effects bolster the conclusion that anterograde and retrograde axonal transport are not necessarily interdependent.",2015,"Samantha L Cavolo, Kresimir Ukalovic, Trina A Schroer, Chaoming Zhou, Stephanie A Ketcham, Michael A Silverman, Edwin S Levitan, Matthew M Suzuki"

Optimizing information flow in small genetic networks. IV. Spatial coupling,26172739,10.1103/PhysRevE.91.062710,"We typically think of cells as responding to external signals independently by regulating their gene expression levels, yet they often locally exchange information and coordinate. Can such spatial coupling be of benefit for conveying signals subject to gene regulatory noise? Here we extend our information-theoretic framework for gene regulation to spatially extended systems. As an example, we consider a lattice of nuclei responding to a concentration field of a transcriptional regulator (the input) by expressing a single diffusible target gene. When input concentrations are low, diffusive coupling markedly improves information transmission; optimal gene activation functions also systematically change. A qualitatively different regulatory strategy emerges where individual cells respond to the input in a nearly steplike fashion that is subsequently averaged out by strong diffusion.

E-cadherin-defective gastric cancer cells depend on Laminin to survive and invade,26246502,10.1093/hmg/ddv312,"Epithelial-cadherin (Ecad) deregulation affects cell-cell adhesion and results in increased invasiveness of distinct human carcinomas. In gastric cancer, loss of Ecad expression is a common event and is associated with disease aggressiveness and poor prognosis. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the invasive process associated to Ecad dysfunction are far from understood. We hypothesized that deregulation of cell-matrix interactions could play an important role during this process. Thus, we focussed on LM-332, which is a major matrix component, and in Ecad/LM-332 crosstalk in the process of Ecad-dependent invasion. To verify whether matrix deregulation was triggered by Ecad loss, we used the Drosophila model. To dissect the key molecules involved and unveil their functional significance, we used gastric cancer cell lines. The relevance of this relationship was then confirmed in human primary tumours. In vivo, Ecad knockdown induced apoptosis; nonetheless, at the invasive front, cells ectopically expressed Laminin A and βPS integrin. In vitro, we demonstrated that, in two different gastric cancer cell models, Ecad-defective cells overexpressed Laminin γ2 (LM-γ2), β1 and β4 integrin, when compared with Ecad-competent ones. We showed that LM-γ2 silencing impaired invasion and enhanced cell death, most likely via pSrc and pAkt reduction, and JNK activation. In human gastric carcinomas, we found a concomitant decrease in Ecad and increase in LM-γ2. This is the ﬁrst evidence that ectopic Laminin expression depends on Ecad loss and allows Ecad-dysfunctional cells to survive and invade. This opens new avenues for using LM-γ2 signalling regulators as molecular targets to impair gastric cancer progression.",2015,"Patrícia Carneiro, Fátima Carneiro, Marta T Pinto, Catarina Brás-Pereira, Raquel Seruca, Ana M Moreira, Florence Janody, Joana Caldeira, Joana Figueiredo, João B Relvas, Mário Barbosa, Fernando Casares"
Wolbachia-mediated antiviral protection in Drosophila larvae and adults following oral infection,26407882,10.1128/AEM.02841-15,"Understanding viral dynamics in arthropods is of great importance when designing models to describe how viral spread can influence arthropod populations. The endosymbiotic bacterium Wolbachia spp., which is present in up to 40% of all insect species, has the ability to alter viral dynamics in both Drosophila spp. and mosquitoes, a feature that in mosquitoes may be utilized to limit spread of important arboviruses. To understand the potential effect of Wolbachia on viral dynamics in nature, it is important to consider the impact of natural routes of virus infection on Wolbachia antiviral effects. Using adult Drosophila strains, we show here that Drosophila-Wolbachia associations that have previously been shown to confer antiviral protection following systemic viral infection also confer protection against virus-induced mortality following oral exposure to Drosophila C virus in adults. Interestingly, a different pattern was observed when the same fly lines were challenged with the virus when still larvae. Analysis of the four Drosophila-Wolbachia associations that were protective in adults indicated that only the w1118-wMelPop association conferred protection in larvae following oral delivery of the virus. Analysis of Wolbachia density using quantitative PCR (qPCR) showed that a high Wolbachia density was congruent with antiviral protection in both adults and larvae. This study indicates that Wolbachia-mediated protection may vary between larval and adult stages of a given Wolbachia-host combination and that the variations in susceptibility by life stage correspond with Wolbachia density. The differences in the outcome of virus infection are likely to influence viral dynamics in Wolbachia-infected insect populations in nature and could also have important implications for the transmission of arboviruses in mosquito populations.",2015,"Aleksej L Stevanovic, Pieter A Arnold, Karyn N Johnson"
Piezo Is Essential for Amiloride-Sensitive Stretch-Activated Mechanotransduction in Larval Drosophila Dorsal Bipolar Dendritic Sensory Neurons,26186008,10.1371/journal.pone.0130969,"Stretch-activated afferent neurons, such as those of mammalian muscle spindles, are essential for proprioception and motor co-ordination, but the underlying mechanisms of mechanotransduction are poorly understood. The dorsal bipolar dendritic (dbd) sensory neurons are putative stretch receptors in the Drosophila larval body wall. We have developed an in vivo protocol to obtain receptor potential recordings from intact dbd neurons in response to stretch. Receptor potential changes in dbd neurons in response to stretch showed a complex, dynamic profile with similar characteristics to those previously observed for mammalian muscle spindles. These profiles were reproduced by a general in silico model of stretch-activated neurons. This in silico model predicts an essential role for a mechanosensory cation channel (MSC) in all aspects of receptor potential generation. Using pharmacological and genetic techniques, we identified the mechanosensory channel, DmPiezo, in this functional role in dbd neurons, with TRPA1 playing a subsidiary role. We also show that rat muscle spindles exhibit a ruthenium red-sensitive current, but found no expression evidence to suggest that this corresponds to Piezo activity. In summary, we show that the dbd neuron is a stretch receptor and demonstrate that this neuron is a tractable model for investigating mechanisms of mechanotransduction.",2015,"Andrew P Jarman, Sonia Watson, Thomas J Suslak, Guy S Bewick, J Douglas Armstrong, Fiona C Shenton, Karen J Thompson"
Constitutive activation of Drosophila CncC transcription factor reduces lipid formation in the fat body,26049108,10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.05.126,"Accumulating evidence indicates that the vertebrate stress-response transcription factors Nrf1 and Nrf2 are involved in hepatic lipid metabolism. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of Nrf1-and Nrf2-mediated lipid metabolism remain unclear. To elucidate the precise roles of Nrfs in this process, we analyzed the physiological role of CncC in lipid metabolism as a Drosophila model for vertebrate Nrf1 and Nrf2. We first examined whether CncC activity is repressed under physiological conditions through a species-conserved NHB1 (N-terminal homology box 1) domain, similar to that observed for Nrf1. Deletion of the NHB1 domain (CncCΔN) led to CncC-mediated rough-eye phenotypes and the induced expression of the CncC target gene gstD1 both in vivo and in vitro. Thus, we decided to explore how CncCΔN overexpression affects the formation of the fat body, which is the major lipid storage organ. Intriguingly, CncCΔN caused a significant reduction in lipid droplet size and triglyceride (TG) levels in the fat body compared to wild type. We found that CncCΔN induced a number of genes related to innate immunity that might have an effect on the regulation of cellular lipid storage. Our study provides new insights into the regulatory mechanism of CncC and its role in lipid homeostasis.",2015,"Hiroaki Taniguchi, Akira Kobayashi, M Rezaul Karim"
Sex peptide receptor is required for the release of stored sperm by mated Drosophila melanogaster females,25783955,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2015.03.006,"The storage of sperm in mated females is important for efficient reproduction. After sperm are transferred to females during mating, they need to reach and enter into the site(s) of storage, be maintained viably within storage, and ultimately be released from storage to fertilize eggs. Perturbation of these events can have drastic consequences on fertility. In Drosophila melanogaster, females store sperm for up to 2 weeks after a single mating. For sperm to be released normally from storage, Drosophila females need to receive the seminal fluid protein (SFP) sex peptide (SP) during mating. SP, which binds to sperm in storage, signals through the sex peptide receptor (SPR) to elicit two other effects on mated females: the persistence of egg laying and a reduction in sexual receptivity. However, it is not known whether SPR is also needed to mediate SP's effect on sperm release. By phenotypic analysis of flies deleted for SPR, and of flies knocked down for SPR, ubiquitously or in specific tissues, we show that SPR is required to mediate SP's effects on sperm release from storage. We show that SPR expression in ppk(+) neurons is needed for proper sperm release; these neurons include those that mediate SP's effect on receptivity and egg laying. However, we find that SPR is also needed in the spermathecal secretory cells of the female reproductive tract for efficient sperm release. Thus, SPR expression is necessary in both the nervous system and in female reproductive tract cells to mediate the release of stored sperm.",2015,"Mariana F Wolfner, Alexandra L Mattei, Frank W Avila"
[The Mechanisms Determining Bristle Pattern in Drosophila melanogaster],26204765,,"Macrochaetes (large bristles) are arranged on the drosophila head and notum in a specific bristle pattern. The number and positions of the macrochaetes forming the pattern are important species-specific characteristics, which are determined by a strict positioning of the proneural clusters in the in the imaginal disc ectoderm in the third instar larvae and prepupae. In turn, the positioning of proneural clusters depends on the distribution of the so-called prepattern factors, responsible for the bristle prepatterning. The current concept identifies the prepattern factors with the transcription factors that initiate the local expression of the achaete-scute complex (AS-C) genes. Expression of these genes confined to certain regions of the ectoderm is the particular factor that determines the macrochaete pattern on the adult fly body. The review considers and systematizes the data on establishment of the prepatterning as the final stage in the functioning of hierarchically organized molecular genetic system resulting in the local expression of AS-C genes in the ectoderm of imaginal discs.",2015,"D P Furman, T A Bukharina"
Brahma regulates the Hippo pathway activity through forming complex with Yki-Sd and regulating the transcription of Crumbs,25496831,10.1016/j.cellsig.2014.12.002,"The Hippo signaling pathway restricts organ size by inactivating the Yorkie (Yki)/Yes-associated protein (YAP) family proteins. The oncogenic Yki/YAP transcriptional coactivator family promotes tissue growth by activating target gene transcription, but the regulation of Yki/YAP activation remains elusive. In mammalian cells, we identified Brg1, a major subunit of chromatin-remodeling SWI/SNF family proteins, which interacts with YAP. This finding led us to investigate the in vivo functional interaction of Yki and Brahma (Brm), the Drosophila homolog of Brg1. We found that Brm functions at the downstream of Hippo pathway and interacts with Yki and Scalloped (Sd) to promotes Yki-dependent transcription and tissue growth. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Brm is required for the Crumbs (Crb) dysregulation-induced Yki activation. Interestingly, we also found that crb is a downstream target of Yki-Brm complex. Brm physically binds to the promoter of crb and regulates its transcription through Yki. Together, we showed that Brm functions as a critical regulator of Hippo signaling during tissue growth and plays an important role in the feedback loop between Crb and Yki.",2015,"Ye Zhu, Dong Li, Chunli Pei, Zengqiang Yuan, Yadong Wang, Lei Zhang, Peng Zhang, Song Liu"
Cold-sensing regulates Drosophila growth through insulin-producing cells,26648410,10.1038/ncomms10083,"Across phyla, body size is linked to climate. For example, rearing fruit flies at lower temperatures results in bigger body sizes than those observed at higher temperatures. The underlying molecular basis of this effect is poorly understood. Here we provide evidence that the temperature-dependent regulation of Drosophila body size depends on a group of cold-sensing neurons and insulin-producing cells (IPCs). Electrically silencing IPCs completely abolishes the body size increase induced by cold temperature. IPCs are directly innervated by cold-sensing neurons. Stimulation of these cold-sensing neurons activates IPCs, promotes synthesis and secretion of Drosophila insulin-like peptides and induces a larger body size, mimicking the effects of rearing the flies in cold temperature. Taken together, these findings reveal a neuronal circuit that mediates the effects of low temperature on fly growth.",2015,"Qiaoran Li, Zhefeng Gong"
Interphase centrosome organization by the PLP-Cnn scaffold is required for centrosome function,26150390,10.1083/jcb.201503117,"Pericentriolar material (PCM) mediates the microtubule (MT) nucleation and anchoring activity of centrosomes.

Here, we investigate the mechanisms that spatially restrict and temporally coordinate centrosome scaffold formation. Focusing on the mitotic-to-interphase transition in Drosophila melanogaster embryos, we show that the elaboration of the interphase Cnn scaffold defines a major structural rearrangement of the centrosome. We identify an unprecedented role for Pericentrin-like protein (PLP), which localizes to the tips of extended Cnn flares, to maintain robust interphase centrosome activity and promote the formation of interphase MT asters required for normal nuclear spacing, centrosome segregation, and compartmentalization of the syncytial embryo.

It was later shown that Hh signaling is associated with many types of cancer, including skin, leukemia, lung, brain and gastrointestinal cancers. Another important milestone for the Hh research field is the FDA approval for the clinical use of Hh inhibitor Erivedge/Vismodegib for treatment of locally advanced and metastatic basal cell carcinomas.

The impact of host diet on Wolbachia titer in Drosophila,25826386,10.1371/journal.ppat.1004777,"While a number of studies have identified host factors that influence endosymbiont titer, little is known concerning environmental influences on titer.

We demonstrate that Drosophila reared on sucrose- and yeast-enriched diets exhibit increased and reduced Wolbachia titers in oogenesis, respectively. The yeast-induced Wolbachia depletion is mediated in large part by the somatic TOR and insulin signaling pathways. Disrupting TORC1 with the small molecule rapamycin dramatically increases oocyte Wolbachia titer, whereas hyper-activating somatic TORC1 suppresses oocyte titer. Furthermore, genetic ablation of insulin-producing cells located in the Drosophila brain abolished the yeast impact on oocyte titer. Exposure to yeast-enriched diets altered Wolbachia nucleoid morphology in oogenesis. Furthermore, dietary yeast increased somatic Wolbachia titer overall, though not in the central nervous system.

We found that negative charge clusters (NCCs) are three to four times more frequent than positive charge clusters (PCCs). The Drosophila proteome is on average the most charged, whereas the human proteome is the least charged. Only 3 to 8% of the studied protein sequences have negative charge clusters, while 1.6 to 3% having PCCs and only 0.07 to 0.6% have both types of clusters.

Increased production of piRNAs from euchromatic clusters and genes in Anopheles gambiae compared with Drosophila melanogaster,26617674,10.1186/s13072-015-0041-5,"Background: Specific genomic loci, termed Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) clusters, manufacture piRNAs that serve as guides for the inactivation of complementary transposable elements (TEs). The piRNA pathway has been accurately detailed in Drosophila melanogaster, while it remains poorly examined in other insects. This pathway is increasingly recognized as critical for germline development and reproduction. Understanding of the piRNA functions in mosquitoes could offer an opportunity for disease vector control by the reduction of their reproductive potential. Results: To analyze the similarities and differences in this pathway between Drosophila and mosquito, we performed an in-depth analysis of the genomic loci producing piRNAs and their targets in the African malaria vector Anopheles gambiae. We identified 187 piRNA clusters in the An. gambiae genome and 155 piRNA clusters in the D. melanogaster genome. We demonstrate that many more piRNA clusters in the mosquito compared with the fruit fly are uni-directionally transcribed and are located outside pericentromeric heterochromatin. About 11 % of the An. gambiae piRNA population map to gene transcripts. This is a noticeable increase compared with the ~6 % of the piRNA population mapped to genes in D. melanogaster. A subset of the piRNA-enriched genes in An. gambiae has functions related to reproduction and development. At least 24 and 65 % of the mapped piRNAs correspond to genomic TE sequences in An. gambiae and D. melanogaster, respectively. DNA transposons and non-LTR retrotransposons are more abundant in An. gambiae, while LTR retrotransposons are more abundant in D. melanogaster. Yet, piRNAs predominantly target LTR retrotransposons in both species, which may point to a distinct feature of these elements compared to the other classes of TEs concerning their silencing by the piRNA pathway. Conclusions: Here, we demonstrate that piRNA-producing loci have more ubiquitous distribution in the An. gambiae genome than in the genome of D. melanogaster. Also, protein-coding genes have an increased role in production of piRNAs in the germline of this mosquito. Genes involved in germline and embryonic development of An. gambiae generate a substantial portion of piRNAs, suggesting a role of the piRNA pathway in the epigenetic regulation of the reproductive processes in the African malaria vector.",2015,"Romain Pogorelcnik, Silke Jensen, Emilie Brasset, Igor V Sharakhov, Phillip George, Jiyoung Lee, Chantal Vaury, Yi Xing"
Neurl4 contributes to germ cell formation and integrity in Drosophila,26116656,10.1242/bio.012351,"Primordial germ cells (PGCs) form at the posterior pole of the Drosophila embryo, and then migrate to their final destination in the gonad where they will produce eggs or sperm. Studies of the different stages in this process, including assembly of germ plasm in the oocyte during oogenesis, specification of a subset of syncytial embryonic nuclei as PGCs, and migration, have been informed by genetic analyses. Mutants have defined steps in the process, and the identities of the affected genes have suggested biochemical mechanisms. Here we describe a novel PGC phenotype. When Neurl4 activity is reduced, newly formed PGCs frequently adopt irregular shapes and appear to bud off vesicles. PGC number is also reduced, an effect exacerbated by a separate role for Neurl4 in germ plasm formation during oogenesis. Like its mammalian homolog, Drosophila Neurl4 protein is concentrated in centrosomes and downregulates centrosomal protein CP110. Reducing CP110 activity suppresses the abnormal PGC morphology of Neurl4 mutants.

Identification of zinc ligands of the insulin-degrading enzyme,7806544,,"The insulin degrading enzyme (IDE), a nonlysosomal enzyme involved in the metabolism of internalized insulin, is a member of a new family of metalloproteases which has an HXXEH active site motif.

Comparison to the prototypic zinc metalloprotease thermolysin, which contains an inversion of this motif, would predict that His112, as well as a downstream glutamate, serves as the second and third zinc ligands of IDE. To examine the role of His112, we mutated this residue to glutamine, leucine, or arginine. To identify a downstream zinc ligand, we substituted a glutamine for glutamate at either Glu182 or Glu189, both of which are conserved in human, rat, and Drosophila IDE. Vectors containing wild type or mutant IDE genes were transfected into COS cells, and the enzymes were analyzed for insulin degradation, insulin cross-linking, and zinc binding. Our results suggest that His108, His112, and Glu189 are the zinc ligands of human IDE, and Glu182 can influence zinc binding.

Therefore, the translation of maternal glp-1 mRNA is temporally and spatially regulated in the C. elegans embryo. The regulation of maternal glp-1 mRNA has striking parallels to the regulation of maternal hunchback mRNA in the Drosophila embryo. Thus, the establishment of embryonic asymmetry in diverse organisms may involve conserved mechanisms of maternal mRNA regulation.",1994,"V Kodoyianni, S L Crittenden, J Kimble, T C Evans"
Modular sequence elements associated with origin regions in eukaryotic chromosomal DNA,8041609,10.1093/nar/22.13.2479,"We have postulated that chromosomal replication origin regions in eukaryotes have in common clusters of certain modular sequence elements (Benbow, Zhao, and Larson, BioEssays 14, 661-670, 1992). In this study, computer analyses of DNA sequences from six origin regions showed that each contained one or more potential initiation regions consisting of a putative DUE (DNA unwinding element) aligned with clusters of SAR (scaffold associated region), and ARS (autonomously replicating sequence) consensus sequences, and pyrimidine tracts. The replication origins analyzed were from the following loci: Tetrahymena thermophila macronuclear rDNA gene, Chinese hamster ovary dihydrofolate reductase amplicon, human c-myc proto-oncogene, chicken histone H5 gene, Drosophila melanogaster chorion gene cluster on the third chromosome, and Chinese hamster ovary rhodopsin gene. The locations of putative initiation regions identified by the computer analyses were compared with published data obtained using diverse methods to map initiation sites. For at least four loci, the potential initiation regions identified by sequence analysis aligned with previously mapped initiation events. A consensus DNA sequence, WAWTTDDWWWDHWGWHMAWTT, was found within the potential initiation regions in every case. An additional 35 kb of combined flanking sequences from the six loci were also analyzed, but no additional copies of this consensus sequence were found.",1994,"W L Shaiu, R M Benbow, D L Dobbs"
Neural specificity of elav expression: defining a Drosophila promoter for directing expression to the nervous system,8207445,10.1046/j.1471-4159.1994.63010041.x,"The Drosophila melanogaster vital gene, embryonic lethal abnormal visual system (elav), is required for the postdeterminative development of the nervous system. Its gene product encodes an RNA binding protein that was found to be expressed in all neurons right after their birth. This specific, ubiquitous, and continuous pattern of neural expression has led to the increasingly popular use of ELAV protein as a neural-specific marker. To understand the molecular basis of this neural-specific expression, we have defined and analyzed the structure of the elav promoter. Cis-acting sequences important for conferring the neural specificity of elav expression were identified by analyzing the reporter gene expression in transformants carrying different elav-beta-galactosidase fusion genes. This analysis delimits a 333-bp region (-92 to +241) that is necessary for specifying the elav pattern of nervous system expression. A 3.5-kb promoter fragment encompassing this region was designed for targeting gene expression specifically to the nervous system and would be a useful tool for the analysis of nervous system function.",1994,"K M Yao, K White"
Resonance assignments and solution structure of the second RNA-binding domain of sex-lethal determined by multidimensional heteronuclear magnetic resonance,7524663,10.1021/bi00250a031,"The RNA-binding protein Sex-lethal (Sxl) is a critical regulator of sexual differentiation and dosage compensation in Drosophila. This regulatory activity is a consequence of the ability of Sxl to bind uridine-rich RNA tracts involved in pre-mRNA splicing. Sxl contains two RNP consensus-type RNA-binding domains (RBDs). A structural study of a portion of Sxl (amino acids 199-294) containing the second RNA-binding domain (RBD-2) using multidimensional heteronuclear NMR is presented here. Nearly complete 1H, 13C, and 15N resonance assignments have been obtained from 15N- and 13C/15N-uniformly labeled protein. These assignments were used to analyze 3D 15N-separated NOESY and 13C/13C-separated 4D NOESY spectra which produced 494 total and 169 long-range NOE-derived distance restraints. Along with 41 backbone dihedral restraints, these distance restraints were employed to generate an intermediate-resolution family of calculated structures, which exhibits the beta alpha beta-beta alpha beta tertiary fold found in other RBD-containing proteins. The RMSD to the average structure for the backbone atoms of residues 11-93 is 1.55 +/- 0.30 A, while the RMSD for backbone atoms involved in secondary structure is 0.76 +/- 0.14 A. A capping box [Harper, E.T., & Rose, G.D. (1993) Biochemistry 32, 7605-7609] was identified at the N-terminus of the first helix and has been characterized by short- and medium-range NOEs.

Mcp and Fab-7: molecular analysis of putative boundaries of cis-regulatory domains in the bithorax complex of Drosophila melanogaster,7915032,10.1093/nar/22.15.3138,"A very large cis-regulatory region of approximately 300 kb is responsible for the complex patterns of expression of the three homeotic genes of the bithorax complex Ubx, abd-A and Abd-B. This region can be subdivided in nine parasegment-specific regulatory subunits. Recent genetic and molecular analysis has revealed the existence of two novel cis-regulatory elements Mcp and Fab-7. Mcp is located between iab-4 and iab-5, the parasegment-specific regulatory subunits which direct Abd-B in parasegments 9 and 10. Similarly, Fab-7 is located between iab-6 and iab-7, the parasegment 11 and 12-specific regulatory units. Mcp and Fab-7 appear to function as domain boundaries that separate adjacent cis-regulatory units. We report the analysis of two new Mcp mutant deletions (McpH27 and McpB116) that allow us to localize sequences essential for boundary function to a approximately 0.4 kb DNA segment. These essential sequences closely coincide to a approximately 0.3 kb nuclease hypersensitive region in chromatin. We also show that sequences contributing to the Fab-7 boundary appear to be spread over a larger stretch of DNA, but like Mcp have an unusual chromatin structure.",1994,"J Gausz, H Gyurkovics, M Galloni, L Sipos, F Karch, P Schedl"
Position effect variegation at fission yeast centromeres,8287474,10.1016/0092-8674(94)90180-5,"Chromatin structure at Schizosaccharomyces pombe centromeres is unusual. The insertion of the ura4 gene within these centromeres resulted in genetically identical cells mosaic for its expression. Placement of the ade6 gene within cen1 or cen3 resulted in red-white sectored colonies, demonstrating the instability of gene expression. The occurrence of pink colonies implied that intermediate levels of repression were established. Repression of both genes within centromeres was temperature sensitive. The chromatin structure of the ura4 gene at centromeres was altered, suggesting that the unusual chromatin encroaches into the gene and inhibits normal expression. These repressive effects at S. pombe centromeres resemble the classical phenomenon of position effect variegation imposed by Drosophila heterochromatin on nearby genes. However, since the epigenetic states can be set at intermediate levels of expression, a purely euchromatin-heterochromatin dichotomy does not apply. A model for the epigenetic regulation of genes placed within S. pombe centromeres is presented.",1994,"N J Redhead, J P Javerzat, R C Allshire, G Cranston"
Interspecific transgenic analysis of basal versus heat-shock-induced expression of a Drosophila pseudoobscura hsp82-neo fusion gene in D. melanogaster,28305933,10.1007/BF00361104,"Drosophila melanogaster transformants containing a D. pseudoobscura hsp82-neo fusion gene were used to examine the relationship between chromosome structure and its variation to transcriptional activation and gene expression. At normal temperatures (25° C) transgenic hsp82-neo was transcribed in diffuse polytene chromosomal bands encoding antibiotic G418-resistance without intensive puff formation. Substantial basal expression of the transgene was observed in all tissues examined: salivary glands, brain, ventral ganglion, foregut, gastric caeca, midgut, imaginal discs, nurse cells and oocytes. In addition, basal hsp82-neo expression occurred throughout embryogenesis. In third-instar larvae subjected to optimal heat shock (36° C), novel heat-shock puffs at the transgene insertion sites in polytene salivary gland chromosomes resulted from a five-fold higher hsp82-neo transcription. Even at extreme heat shock (38° C) the transgene puffs corresponded to transcriptionally active sites. RNA probe protections showed that the natural intron of the D. pseudoobscura hsp82-neo transgene was efficiently removed from pre-mRNA by the D. melanogaster splicing machinery at 25-36° C. Upon extreme heat shock above 37° C intron splicing was inhibited. During recovery (25° C) from heat shock (36° C/20 min) the heat-induced hsp82-neo transcription was rapidly repressed and all novel transgene puffs regressed. The basal level of transcription of hsp82-neo pre-mRNA was restored within 1-2 h. The hsp82-neo mRNA returned to basal level within 3-4 h. Overall, these results demonstrate a conservation of cis-regulatory elements and trans-regulatory factors which is needed for faithful expression across the species barrier of the D. pseudoobscura hsp82-neo transgene in D. melanogaster.",1994,Heinz Sass

From the samples taken for the standard analyses of selection components, it is not usually possible to obtain the mating table, and only directional selection for male mating success can be detected. Both processes, mating pattern and differential mating probability, together with other fitness components, have been investigated for the inversion polymorphism of a natural population of the cactophilic species Drosophila buzzatii. Two independent samples of adult flies were collected: nonmating or single individuals (base population) and mating pairs (mating population). All individuals were karyotyped for the second and fourth chromosomes. A sequence of models with increasing simplicity was fitted to the data to test null hypotheses of no selection and random union of gametes and karyotypes. The main results were (1) no deviations from random mating were found; (2) differential mating probability was nonsignificant in both sexes; (3) inversion and karyotypic frequencies did not differ between sexes; and (4) karyotypic frequencies did not depart from Hardy-Weinberg expectations. These results are discussed in light of complementary evidence showing the need for interpreting with caution no-effect hypotheses such as the ones tested here. The use of complementary selective tests in these studies is suggested.",1994,"Alfredo Ruiz, Antonio Fontdevila, Antonio Barbadilla, Mauro Santos"
"Mutations in calphotin, the gene encoding a Drosophila photoreceptor cell-specific calcium-binding protein, reveal roles in cellular morphogenesis and survival",7828824,,"Calphotin is a Drosophila photoreceptor cell-specific protein expressed very early in eye development, at the time when cell-type decisions are being made. Calphotin is a very hydrophobic and proline-rich protein which lacks obvious transmembrane domains. The cDNA encoding Calphotin was mapped to a region removed by a set of existing chromosomal deletions. Mutations that alter photoreceptor cell structure and development were isolated that fail to complement these deletions. These mutations fall into two classes. Class I mutations alter the structure of the rhabdomere, a photoreceptor cell organelle specialized for phototransduction. Class II mutations have rough eyes, due to misorientation of the rhabdomeres and photoreceptor cell death. Transformation rescue of these phenotypes in transgenic flies bearing calphotin genomic DNA indicates that both classes of mutations are in the calphotin gene. Analysis of these mutations suggest that Calphotin plays important roles in both rhabdomere development and in photoreceptor cell survival.",1994,"Y Yang, D Ballinger"

Different lipase activities are present in various tissues in the fly. In particular, an abundant lipase activity is present in the male accessory gland. An esterase null mutant was used to confirm that the enzyme activity was due to a distinct lipase and not non-specific activity from esterase 6 which is also abundant in accessory glands. The properties of the accessory-gland lipase were investigated, and pH optima and substrate utilization suggest that it has some similarities to vertebrate bile-salt-stimulated lipase. Lipase activity is significantly reduced in males and increased in females shortly after mating. This finding suggests that lipase activity is transferred to the female and may be important in mating and reproduction in Drosophila.",1994,"S J Yeaman, G M Smith, K Rothwell, S L Wood, M Bownes"
Morphogenesis in the early embryo of the lepidopteran Bombyx mori,8088432,10.1006/dbio.1994.1241,"The regional patterns of nuclear and cell division and the changes in size and shape of the developing Bombyx mori embryo were monitored from just prior to blastoderm formation until the onset of gastrulation. Nuclear invasion of the periphery and subsequent cellularization occurs with a marked anterior to posterior gradient. Consequently, there is no syncytial blastoderm stage in which all nuclei simultaneously rest at the periphery. In addition, the posterior-most blastoderm cells do not form pole cells. Prior to gastrulation, the Bombyx blastoderm cells undergo several unusual types of cell behaviors, indicated in part by the modifications and specializations of their lateral edges. Subsequent to the completion of cellularization, localized regions of mitosis can be found within the germ anlage, but at the stage monitored, just prior to the onset of gastrulation, these regions do not appear to be the equivalent of the Drosophila mitotic domains. The implications of these findings for modeling how segmental fates are established in insects are discussed.

Conserved cut repeats in the human cut homeodomain protein function as DNA binding domains,7904999,,"Homeodomain-containing proteins are believed to function as sequence-specific DNA binding proteins, regulating gene expression. Specificity of sequence recognition is conferred by the homeodomain acting either alone or in conjunction with other conserved DNA binding domains as is the case for Pou domain and Paired domain proteins. The recent isolation of cDNAs encoding mammalian homologues of the Drosophila Cut homeodomain protein has revealed that the 72-amino acid Cut Repeats are conserved in evolution. We have investigated the biochemical activity of human Cut Repeats by expressing fusion proteins containing glutathione S-transferase linked to various combinations of Cut Repeats and Cut homeodomain. We show by gel retardation and DNase footprinting assays that Cut Repeats can function as DNA binding domains, either independently or in cooperation with the homeodomain. The binding affinity (KD) to a specific recognition site was estimated to be 8 x 10(-9) M for Cut Repeat 3 and 4 x 10(-10) M for Cut Repeat 1. When both Cut Repeat 3 and the Cut homeodomain were present in the fusion protein, the binding affinity was increased to 4 x 10(-11) M. These results define a novel class of proteins that contain in addition to the homeodomain a second conserved protein domain, the Cut Repeats, that also function as a DNA binding domain.",1994,"C Denis-Larose, R Harada, A Nepveu, D Dufort"

In vivo circadian function of casein kinase 2 phosphorylation sites in Drosophila PERIOD,16319317,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2159-05.2005,"Phosphorylation plays a key role in the precise timing of circadian clocks. Daily rhythms of phosphorylation of the Drosophila circadian clock component PERIOD (PER) were first described more than a decade ago, yet little is known about their phosphorylation sites and their function in circadian behavior. Here we show that serines 151 and 153 in PER are required for robust in vitro phosphorylation by the casein kinase 2 (CK2) holoenzyme, a cytoplasmic kinase shown to be involved in circadian rhythms. Mutation of these sites in transgenic flies results in significant period lengthening of behavioral rhythms, altered PER rhythms, and delayed PER nuclear localization in circadian pacemaker neurons. In many respects, mutation of these phosphorylation sites phenocopies mutation of the catalytic subunit of CK2. We propose that CK2 phosphorylation at these sites triggers PER nuclear localization.",2005,"Jui-Ming Lin, Analyne Schroeder, Ravi Allada"
Tid1 is required for T cell transition from double-negative 3 to double-positive stages,15879105,10.4049/jimmunol.174.10.6105,"Tid1, a DnaJ cochaperone protein, is the mammalian homologue of the Drosophila tumor suppressor Tid56 whose antitumor function is most likely mediated through its capacity to regulate cell differentiation in imaginal discs. We suspected that the mammalian counterpart, tid1, may also be involved in regulating cell differentiation. To investigate this, we exploited the system of T cell development to examine whether tid1 plays a role in this well-defined process. Mice with tid1 specifically deleted in T cells developed thymic atrophy, with dramatic reduction of double-positive and single-positive thymocytes in the tid1(-/-) thymus. Although the subpopulations of tid1(-/-) double-negative (DN) 1-3 thymocytes were normal, the subpopulation of DN4 thymocytes was measurably smaller because of reduced proliferation and significant cell death. Immature tid1(-/-) thymocytes show normal VDJ beta-chain rearrangement and pre-TCR and CD3 expression in both DN3 and DN4 thymocytes, but in DN4 thymocytes, there was significantly reduced expression of the antiapoptotic bcl-2 gene. Restoring the expression level of Bcl-2 protein in tid1(-/-) thymus by introduction of a transgenic human bcl-2 gene resulted in reversal of the developmental defects in tid1(-/-) thymus. Together, these results demonstrate that tid1 is critical in early thymocyte development, especially during transition from the DN3 to double-positive stages, possibly through its regulation of bcl-2 expression, which provides survival signals.",2005,"Jeng-Fan Lo, Jiing-Dwan Lee, He Zhou, Young Yang, Ralph A Reisfeld, Colleen Fearns"

The purpose of this study was to investigate the black gene, and protein, in black(1) mutants of Drosophila melanogaster in order to resolve the apparent paradox of the black phenotype. Using black(1) mutant flies we show that (1) aspartate decarboxylase activity is significantly reduced in adults and at puparium formation, consistent with defects in cuticular and non-cuticular processes, (2) that the black(1) mutation is a frameshift, and black(1) flies are nulls for the black/DGAD2 protein, and (3) that behavioural experiments using Buridan's paradigm, demonstrate that black responds abnormally to visual cues.

In this paper, several isoforms of X. laevis casein kinase I (CKI) were analyzed to address whether they are involved in the phosphorylation and degradation of period protein (PER), as they are in the circadian oscillators of other species. cDNAs encoding two splice variants of CKI(delta) (a full-length form and deletion isoform, which is missing an exon that encodes a putative nuclear localization signal and two evolutionarily conserved protein kinase domains) were isolated and analyzed, together with a previously isolated CKI(epsilon) isoform. Both CKI(delta) and CKI(epsilon) were shown to be constitutively expressed in the photoreceptors of the retina, where a circadian clock has been localized. Both the full-length CKI(delta) and CKI(epsilon) were shown to have kinase activity in vitro, and the full-length CKI(delta) phosphorylated and degraded Drosophila PER when expressed in Drosophila S2 cells. The expression and biochemical characteristics of these CKIs are consistent with an evolutionarily conserved role for CKI in the Xenopus retinal clock. The CKI(delta) deletion isoform did not exhibit kinase activity and did not trigger degradation of PER. Subcellular localization of both CKI(delta) isoforms was cytoplasmic in several cell culture lines, but the full-length CKI(delta) , and not the deletion CKI(delta) isoform, was localized to both the nucleus and the cytoplasm in Drosophila S2 cells. These results indicate that the sequences missing in the deletion CKI(delta) isoform are important for the nuclear localization and kinase activity of the full-length isoform and that one or both of these features are necessary for degradation of Drosophila PER.",2005,"Jeffrey L Price, Fabian Preuss, Carla B Green, Cara M Constance, Jin-Yuan Fan"
Anterior localization of maternal mRNAs in a short germ insect lacking bicoid,15733312,10.1111/j.1525-142X.2005.05016.x,"Anterior morphogens have long been postulated to function in early pattern formation in several insect taxa. Genetic studies in Drosophila revealed that the Bicoid protein performs as such in the fly. Maternally provided bicoid (bcd) mRNA is localized at the anterior pole of the oocyte and, upon fertilization, acts as the source of a morphogenetic gradient of Bicoid protein. Despite its central role in Drosophila, it is believed that bicoid arose rather recently during dipteran evolution through duplication of the Hox3 ortholog zen. Here we show that in the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum, RNAs of the homologs of the Drosophila transcription factors eagle (Tc'eagle) and pangolin (Tc'pan) are maternally localized at the anterior pole of the egg. It is possible that underlying mechanisms for the anterior localization of maternal RNAs evolved independently in the two clades. However, considering the complexity of the process in Drosophila, it is more tempting to speculate that the molecular machinery evolved only once during insect evolution. Under this assumption, it was present before bicoid evolved as an anterior morphogen. To become concentrated at the anterior pole of the egg bicoid may only have had to acquire a signal sequence that was recognized by the preexisting localization machinery. Although we were not able to demonstrate a function in early embryogenesis for Tc'eagle or Tc'pan, our findings suggest that other factors likely function as anterior determinants in Tribolium, and other nondipteran insects.",2005,"Laila Farzana, Martin Klingler, Gregor Bucher, Susan J Brown"
"Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptors and inositol phosphates in the heart-evolutionary artefacts or active signal transducers?",15908009,10.1016/j.pharmthera.2005.04.002,"The generation of the second messenger inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P(3)) and its associated release of Ca(2+) from internal stores is a highly conserved module in intracellular signaling from Drosophila to mammals. Many cell types, often nonexcitable cells, depend on this pathway to couple external signals to intracellular Ca(2+) release. However, despite the presence of the requisite Ins(1,4,5)P(3) signaling machinery, excitable cells such as cardiac myocytes employ a robust alternate system of intracellular Ca(2+) release, namely, a coupled system of Ca(2+) influx, followed by Ca(2+) release via the IP(3)R-related ryanodine receptors. In these systems, Ins(1,4,5)P(3) signaling pathways appear to be largely dormant. In this review, we consider the general features of inositol phosphate (InsP) responses in cardiac myocytes and the molecules mediating these responses. The spatial localization of Ins(1,4,5)P(3) generation and Ins(1,4,5)P(3) receptor (IP(3)Rs) is likely of key importance, and we examine the state of knowledge in atrial, ventricular, and Purkinje myocytes. Several studies have implicated Ins(1,4,5)P(3) generation in both arrhythmogenic and hypertrophic responses, and possible mechanisms involving Ins(1,4,5)P(3) are discussed. While Ins(1,4,5)P(3) is unlikely to be a key player in cardiac excitation-contraction (EC) coupling, its potential role in an alternate Ca(2+) release system to signal changes in gene transcription warrants further investigation. Such studies will help to determine whether cardiac Ins(1,4,5)P(3) generation represents a vestigial pathway or plays an active role in cardiac signaling.",2005,"Elizabeth A Woodcock, Scot J Matkovich"
Live imaging of Drosophila brain neuroblasts reveals a role for Lis1/dynactin in spindle assembly and mitotic checkpoint control,16107559,10.1091/mbc.e05-04-0338,"Lis1 is required for nuclear migration in fungi, cell cycle progression in mammals, and the formation of a folded cerebral cortex in humans. Lis1 binds dynactin and the dynein motor complex, but the role of Lis1 in many dynein/dynactin-dependent processes is not clearly understood. Here we generate and/or characterize mutants for Drosophila Lis1 and a dynactin subunit, Glued, to investigate the role of Lis1/dynactin in mitotic checkpoint function. In addition, we develop an improved time-lapse video microscopy technique that allows live imaging of GFP-Lis1, GFP-Rod checkpoint protein, green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labeled chromosomes, or GFP-labeled mitotic spindle dynamics in neuroblasts within whole larval brain explants. Our mutant analyses show that Lis1/dynactin have at least two independent functions during mitosis: first promoting centrosome separation and bipolar spindle assembly during prophase/prometaphase, and subsequently generating interkinetochore tension and transporting checkpoint proteins off kinetochores during metaphase, thus promoting timely anaphase onset. Furthermore, we show that Lis1/dynactin/dynein physically associate and colocalize on centrosomes, spindle MTs, and kinetochores, and that regulation of Lis1/dynactin kinetochore localization in Drosophila differs from both Caenorhabditis elegans and mammals. We conclude that Lis1/dynactin act together to regulate multiple, independent functions in mitotic cells, including spindle formation and cell cycle checkpoint release.",2005,"Ruth Steward, Madeline Serr, Chris Q Doe, Karsten H Siller, Tom S Hays"

Some arthropods, however, do not possess composite eyes, obviously by secondary reduction. Reductions on the level of conserved eye developmental genes are one possibility to reduce the visual system. The genes of the Pax6 family have been shown to be key regulators of visual system development in a wide variety of animals. Reduction of Pax6 expression may therefore be expected in a species with reduced eyes. Here I have investigated the myriapod Glomeris marginata that displays very simple eyes. Glomeris, however, possesses two Pax6 genes that, based on their sequence, are similar to Drosophila eyeless (ey) and twin of eyeless (toy), respectively. Both genes are highly expressed in the optic lobes and the ventral nerve cord of developing embryos. Furthermore, homologs of other high-ranking eye developmental genes like hedgehog, decapentaplegic, dachshund, and homothorax are expressed in the optic lobes. This indicates that eye reduction in Glomeris is not realized at the level of the Pax6 genes or other genes on the upper levels of the eye development network. I suggest instead that the simple eyes of Glomeris are the product of changes at a much lower level in the network, probably at the level of genes directly regulating ommatidia development or ommatidia number and arrangement.",2005,Nikola-Michael Prpic
Development and sensitivity to serotonin of Drosophila serotonergic varicosities in the central nervous system,16122730,10.1016/j.ydbio.2005.07.025,"Serotonin is a classical small-molecule neurotransmitter with known effects on developmental processes. Previous studies have shown a developmental role for serotonin in the fly peripheral nervous system. In this study, we show that serotonin can modulate the development of serotonergic varicosities within the fly central nervous system. We have developed a system to examine the development of serotonergic varicosities in the larval CNS. We use this method to describe the normal serotonergic development in the A7 abdominal ganglion. From first to third instar larvae, the volume of the neuropil and number of serotonergic varicosities increase substantially while the varicosity density remains relatively constant. We hypothesize that serotonin is an autoregulator for serotonergic varicosity density. We tested the sensitivity of serotonergic varicosities to serotonin by adding neurotransmitter at various stages to isolated larval ventral nerve cords. Addition of excess exogenous serotonin decreases native varicosity density in older larvae, and these acute effects are reversible. The effects of serotonin appear to be selective for serotonergic varicosities, as dopaminergic and corazonergic varicosities remain qualitatively intact following serotonin application.",2005,"Barry G Condron, Paul A Sykes"
The mode of evolution of aggregation pheromones in Drosophila species,16135121,10.1111/j.1420-9101.2005.00971.x,"Aggregation pheromones are used by fruit flies of the genus Drosophila to assemble on breeding substrates, where they feed, mate and oviposit communally. These pheromones consist of species-specific blends of chemicals. Here, using a phylogenetic framework, we examine how differences among species in these pheromone blends have evolved. Theoretical predictions, genetic evidence, and previous empirical analysis of bark beetle species, suggest that aggregation pheromones do not evolve gradually, but via major, saltational shifts in chemical composition. Using pheromone data for 28 species of Drosophila we show that, unlike with bark beetles, the distribution of chemical components among species is highly congruent with their phylogeny, with closely related species being more similar in their pheromone blends than are distantly related species. This pattern is also strong within the melanogaster species group, but less so within the virilis species group. Our analysis strongly suggests that the aggregation pheromones of Drosophila exhibit a gradual, not saltational, mode of evolution. We propose that these findings reflect the function of the pheromones in the ecology of Drosophila, which does not hinge on species specificity of aggregation pheromones as signals.",2005,"M R E Symonds, B Wertheim"

Within all three datasets, more than 25 000 molecular ions (an average of 9000 +/- 2000 per individual) corresponding to protonated precursor ions of individual peptides have been observed. A comparison of peaks among the datasets reveals that peaks corresponding to protonated peptides that are found in all heads are more intense than those features that appear between pairs of or within only one of the individuals. Moreover, there is little variability in the relative intensities of the peaks common among all individuals. It appears that it is the lower abundance components of the proteome that play the most significant role in determining unique features of individuals.",2005,"Xinfeng Gao, David F Miller, Stephen J Valentine, John A Taraszka, Thomas C Kaufman, David E Clemmer, Renã A Sowell, Stormy L Koeniger"
dAkt kinase controls follicle cell size during Drosophila oogenesis,15712201,10.1002/dvdy.20333,"The Drosophila Akt (dAkt) serine/threonine kinase is a component of the insulin receptor/PI3K signaling pathway that regulates cell growth. Here, we show that this kinase is expressed during Drosophila oogenesis and is required for egg chamber development. Loss of dAkt function in follicle cells causes a cell-autonomous reduction of cell size while expression of the constitutively active myristylated form of this kinase (dAkt(myr)) causes increased cell size. Accordingly, expression of the antagonist dPTEN in the same follicular domains causes reduced follicle cell size. Perturbations of dAkt function do not affect follicle cell proliferation or cell death. Of interest, expression of dAkt(myr) in the posterior domain of the follicular epithelium causes a delay in the posterior movement of follicular epithelium and dumpless-like egg chambers. It appears that dAkt is required for maintaining the continuity of cell size within the follicular epithelium, which in turn is necessary for its proper morphogenesis.",2005,"Valeria Cavaliere, Giuseppe Gargiulo, Anita Hsouna, Tien Hsu, Alessandra Donati"
Calorie restriction--the SIR2 connection,15734680,10.1016/j.cell.2005.01.029,"A nutritious diet low in calories improves the health and extends the life span of rodents. Recent studies identified a gene, SIR2, which encodes an NAD-dependent deacetylase and may mediate the effects of calorie restriction. In this review, we discuss SIR2 genes and calorie restriction in the lower organisms yeast and Drosophila. We then describe the physiological changes in mammals during calorie restriction and how they may lead to the observed health benefits. We summarize the roles of mammalian Sirt1 in mediating these changes in tissues and endocrine systems and propose that Sirt1 regulates calorie restriction by sensing low calories and triggering physiological changes linked to health and longevity.",2005,"Leonard Guarente, Frédéric Picard"
Sp1 and Sp3 regulate basal transcription of the human CYP2F1 gene,15860659,10.1124/dmd.105.004069,"Selective transcription of the human CYP2F1 gene in lung tissues may control the susceptibilities of this organ to diverse pneumotoxicants and lung carcinogens. However, the mechanisms responsible for CYP2F1 organ-selective transcription have not been elucidated. The objectives of the current studies were to identify and characterize basal transcription elements within the TATA-less promoter region of CYP2F1. Four putative Sp1-like sites were identified in the CYP2F1 promoter. Competitive electrophoretic mobility shift assay analysis with mutated oligonucleotide probes and lung A549 cell nuclear extract, along with supershift studies using antibodies to either Sp1 or Sp3 proteins, demonstrated that all four sites formed three specific protein-DNA complexes. Mutations in any of the four core Sp1-like motifs abolished protein-DNA binding. Western blot analysis of both human tissues and cells showed that Sp1 was considerably higher in lung than liver and that Sp3 was much higher in liver than lung. Promoter activation of a luciferase reporter construct was sequentially increased by addition of each of the four Sp1-like motifs in lung A549 cells but not in liver HepG2 cells. Cotransfection of a Sp1 expression vector with the reporter construct dramatically increased luciferase activity in either A549 cells or Sp1-deficient Drosophila Schneider line 2 (SL-2) cells. However, similar cotransfections with an Sp3 expression vector failed to increase activity. Cotransfection of both the Sp1 and Sp3 expression vectors considerably decreased Sp1-mediated activity in A549 cells and abolished activity in SL-2 cells. Thus, these studies demonstrated that four Sp1-dependent proximal promoter elements drive organ-selective CYP2F1 gene transcription, and that Sp1 and Sp3 factors interact to modulate constitutive CYP2F1 transcription in lung cells.",2005,"Brian A Carr, N Shane Cutler, Garold S Yost, Diane L Lanza, Jie Wan, Ronald N Hines"

Usp9x is the mouse homolog of faf, known for its function in synaptic development in Drosophila. In adults, high levels of expression of Usp9x protein were found in layer V of neocortex, Purkinje cells in cerebellum, and specific hippocampal subfields. In hippocampal pyramidal cells, Usp9x expression was higher in CA3 than in CA1. This regional specificity was detected at postnatal day 22 but not at postnatal day 15. In adult mice, the CA1-CA3 difference was partially accounted for by a difference in the level of Usp9x mRNA, suggesting that transcription of Usp9x was differentially regulated between hippocampal subfields. Two synaptic marker proteins, synaptotagmin and spinophilin, were both more abundant in the striatum oriens of CA3 than in the similar region of CA1, correlating with the distribution of Usp9x, a result compatible with a role for Usp9x in synaptic development in mouse hippocampus. Ube1x, the enzyme responsible for the initial step in ubiquitin conjugation, was preferentially concentrated in the dendrites of the CA1 neurons instead of the CA3 neurons, suggesting a reciprocal relationship between ubiquitin conjugation and deubiquitination in CA3 and CA1. This spatial and temporal specificity in expression of Usp9x and Ube1x protein raises interesting questions about the roles of these ubiquitin enzymes in the differential functions of CA1 and CA3.",2005,"Jun Xu, Kozo Kaibuchi, Shinichiro Taya, Arthur P Arnold"
"Control of cell proliferation and apoptosis by mob as tumor suppressor, mats",15766530,10.1016/j.cell.2004.12.036,"Appropriate cell number and organ size in a multicellular organism are determined by coordinated cell growth, proliferation, and apoptosis. Disruption of these processes can cause cancer. Recent studies have identified the Large tumor suppressor (Lats)/Warts (Wts) protein kinase as a key component of a pathway that controls the coordination between cell proliferation and apoptosis. Here we describe growth inhibitory functions for a Mob superfamily protein, termed Mats (Mob as tumor suppressor), in Drosophila. Loss of Mats function results in increased cell proliferation, defective apoptosis, and induction of tissue overgrowth. We show that mats and wts function in a common pathway. Mats physically associates with Wts to stimulate the catalytic activity of the Wts kinase. A human Mats ortholog (Mats1) can rescue the lethality associated with loss of Mats function in Drosophila. As Mats1 is mutated in human tumors, Mats-mediated growth inhibition and tumor suppression is likely conserved in humans.",2005,"Li-Lun Ho, Edward Ramos, Takeshi Shimizu, Zhi-Chun Lai, Nikolas Nikolaidis, Ying Li, Xiaomu Wei, Margaret Rohrbaugh"
Characterization of the 5' regulatory region of the Drosophila Dmdop1 dopamine receptor-gene,15986377,10.1002/arch.20062,"The pharmacological and functional properties of many biogenic-amine receptors have been thoroughly investigated. In contrast, knowledge about the transcriptional regulation of receptor genes is limited. Here we describe the structural and functional properties of the promoter region of a dopamine receptor-gene (Dmdop1) from Drosophila. The transcriptional start site was identified by 5'-RACE (5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends) cloning and primer-extension analysis. A consensus site for transcriptional initiation (INR element) is located 494 bp upstream of the ATG codon of the open reading-frame. The promoter neither contains TATA- nor CAAT boxes but several GC-rich elements. Relative promoter activity was monitored by CAT reporter-gene analysis in different neuronal cell lines. The Dmdop1 promoter contains one activating (-454/+125) and two silencing regions (-1481/-454 and +125/+495). Interestingly, one silencing region harbours a CRE (cAMP responsive element) site. Since the DmDOP1 receptor leads to cAMP production in cells, the CRE site might contribute to the receptors' own expression by cAMP-dependent transcription factors.",2005,"Verena Kehren, Arnd Baumann"
Remating in Drosophila melanogaster: an examination of the trading-up and intrinsic male-quality hypotheses,16135127,10.1111/j.1420-9101.2005.00918.x,"Female Drosophila melanogaster remate more frequently than necessary to ensure fertilization. We tested whether polyandrous females gain genetic benefits for their offspring by (1) selecting secondary sires of higher genetic-quality than original partners or (2) because post-copulatory mechanisms bias fertilizations towards genetically superior males. We screened 119 hemiclones of males for lifetime fitness then selected eight hemiclones (four of extreme high fitness and four of extreme low fitness) and mated them to virgin females. Females were then given the opportunity to remate with males of benchmark-genetic quality and their propensity to remate (fidelity) and sperm displacement scored. A female's fidelity and her level of sperm displacement varied depending on which hemiclone she mated first, but not on male-genetic quality. These findings indicate that female remating and sperm displacement are strongly influenced by male genotype, but provide no evidence that these traits contribute to adaptive female choice to obtain superior genes for offspring.",2005,"W R Rice, P G Byrne"
Dopamine is a regulator of arousal in the fruit fly,16093388,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2048-05.2005,"Sleep and arousal are known to be regulated by both homeostatic and circadian processes, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are not well understood. It has been reported that the Drosophila rest/activity cycle has features in common with the mammalian sleep/wake cycle, and it is expected that use of the fly genetic model will facilitate a molecular understanding of sleep and arousal. Here, we report the phenotypic characterization of a Drosophila rest/activity mutant known as fumin (fmn). We show that fmn mutants have abnormally high levels of activity and reduced rest (sleep); genetic mapping, molecular analyses, and phenotypic rescue experiments demonstrate that these phenotypes result from mutation of the Drosophila dopamine transporter gene. Consistent with the rest phenotype, fmn mutants show enhanced sensitivity to mechanical stimuli and a prolonged arousal once active, indicating a decreased arousal threshold. Strikingly,fmn mutants do not show significant rebound in response to rest deprivation as is typical for wild-type flies, nor do they show decreased life span. These results provide direct evidence that dopaminergic signaling has a critical function in the regulation of insect arousal.",2005,"Shoen Kume, Jay Hirsh, F Rob Jackson, Sang Ki Park, Kazuhiko Kume"
Biochemical mode of action and differential activity of new ecdysone agonists against mosquitoes and moths,15756700,10.1002/arch.20046,"THQ (1-aroyl-4-(arylamino)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline) compounds were identified by FMC Corporation in cell-based assays that used ecdysone receptors from Drosophila melanogaster, Heliothis virescens, or Plodia interpunctata.

Several ecdysone agonists based on THQ chemotype have been synthesized and tested for their activity against a number of EcRs in transactivation assays. The THQ compound, RG-120768, activated AaEcR (EcR from A. aegypti) but did not activate EcRs cloned from other insects. In transactivation assays, all six THQ ligands tested functioned through AaEcR but not through CfEcR (EcR from Choristoneura fumiferana). Three THQ compounds that showed higher activity in transactivation assays were tested in tobacco bud moth, H. virescens, and yellow fever mosquito, A. aegypti. These compounds showed higher activity in A. aegypti when compared to their activity in H. virescens.

Structure and metabolism of peptidoglycan and molecular requirements allowing its detection by the Drosophila innate immune system,15949137,10.1179/096805105X35233,"Peptidoglycan (murein) is a major essential and specific constituent of the bacterial cell wall. Its main function is to protect cells against the internal osmotic pressure and to maintain the characteristic cell shape. It also serves as a platform for the anchoring of specific proteins and other cell wall components. This giant macromolecule is composed of long glycan chains cross-linked by short peptides. Any alteration of the disaccharide-peptide basic unit results in a global change of peptidoglycan structure and properties. Such global variations are encountered in nature as conserved variations along phyletic lines but have sometimes been acquired as a result of mutations or as a mechanism of resistance against cell-wall targeted antibiotics. During bacterial cell growth and division, the peptidoglycan mesh is constantly broken down by a set of highly specific hydrolases in a maturation process allowing insertion of newly synthesized units in the pre-existing polymerized material. Depending on the bacterial species considered, degradation fragments are either released in the growth medium or efficiently re-utilized for synthesis of new murein in a sequence of events termed the recycling pathway. Peptidoglycan is one of the main pathogen-associated molecular patterns recognized by the host innate immune system. Variations of the structure and metabolism of this cell wall component have been exploited by host defense mechanisms for detection/identification of invading bacterial species. Modification of the peptidoglycan structure could also represent a mechanism allowing bacteria to escape these host defense systems.",2005,"Bruno Lemaitre, Dominique Mengin-Lecreulx"

Identification in vivo of different rate-limiting steps associated with transcriptional activators in the presence and absence of a GAGA element,15831460,10.1128/MCB.25.9.3543-3552.2005,"We analyzed the impact of a GAGA element on a transgenic promoter in Drosophila melanogaster that was activated by proteins composed of the Tet(on) DNA binding domain and either the heat shock factor (HSF) activation domain or a potent subdomain of VP16. Permanganate footprinting was used to monitor polymerase II (Pol II) on the transgenic promoters in vivo. Activation by Tet(on)-HSF but not by Tet(on)-VP16(A2) required the GAGA element; this correlated with the ability of the GAGA element to establish a paused Pol II. Although the GAGA element was not required for activation by Tet(on)-VP16(A2), the GAGA element greatly accelerated the rate of activation. The permanganate data also provided evidence that Pol II encountered different rate-limiting steps, following initiation in the presence of Tet(on)-HSF and Tet(on)-VP16(A2). The rate-limiting step in the presence of Tet(on)-HSF was release of Pol II paused about 20 to 40 nucleotides downstream from the start site. The rate-limiting step in the presence of Tet(on)-VP16(A2) occurred much closer to the transcription start site. Several biochemical studies have provided evidence for a structural transition shortly after Pol II initiates transcription. The behavior of Pol II in the presence of Tet(on)-VP16(A2) provides the first evidence that this transition occurs in vivo.",2005,"David S Gilmour, Hongbing Tang, Yunyuan Vivian Wang"
"Expression of genes encoding proteins involved in ecdysteroidogenesis in the female mosquito, Aedes aegypti",15804580,10.1016/j.ibmb.2005.01.011,"A blood meal induces the ovaries of female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes to produce ecdysteroid hormones that regulate many processes required for egg maturation. Various proteins involved in the intracellular transport and biosynthesis of ecdysteroid precursors have been identified by analysis of Drosophila melanogaster mutants and by biochemical and molecular techniques in other insects. To begin examining these processes in mosquito ovaries, complete cDNAs were cloned for putative orthologs of diazepam-binding inhibitor (DBI), StAR-related lipid transfer domain containing protein (Start1), aldo/keto reductase (A/KR), adrenodoxin reductase (AR), and the cytochrome P450 enzymes, CYP302a1 (22-hydroxylase), CYP315a1 (2-hydroxylase) and CYP314a1 (20-hydroxylase). As shown by RT-PCR, transcripts for all seven genes were present in ovaries and other tissues both before and following a blood meal. Expression of these genes likely supports the low level of ecdysteroids produced in vitro (7-10 pg /tissue/6 h) by tissues other than ovaries. Ovaries from females not blood fed and up to 6 h post blood meal (PBM) also produced low amounts of ecdysteroids in vitro, but by 18 and 30 h PBM, ecdysteroid production was greatly increased (75-106 pg/ovary pair/6h) and thereafter (48 and 72 h PBM) returned to low levels. As determined by real-time PCR analysis, gene transcript abundance for AedaeCYP302 and AedaeCYP315a1 was significantly greater (9 and 12 fold, respectively) in ovaries during peak ecdysteroid production relative to that in ovaries from females not blood fed or 2 h PBM. AedaeStart1, AedaeA/KR and AedaeAR also had high transcript levels in ovaries during peak ecdysteroid production, and AedaeDBI transcripts had the greatest increase at 48 h PBM. In contrast, gene transcript abundance of AedaeCYP314a1 decreased PBM. This study shows for the first time that transcription of a few key genes for proteins involved in ecdysteroid biosynthesis is positively correlated with the rise in ecdysteroid production by ovaries of a female insect.",2005,"Kelli Adams Duncan, Douglas H Sieglaff, Mark R Brown"

Integrin-independent repression of cadherin transcription by talin during axis formation in Drosophila,15852002,10.1038/ncb1253,"The Drosophila melanogaster anterior-posterior axis becomes polarized early during oogenesis by the posterior localization of the oocyte within the egg chamber. The invariant position of the oocyte is thought to be driven by an upregulation of the adhesion molecule DE-cadherin in the oocyte and the posterior somatic follicle cells, providing the first in vivo example of cell sorting that is specified by quantitative differences in cell-cell adhesion. However, it has remained unclear how DE-cadherin levels are regulated. Here, we show that talin, known for its role in linking integrins to the actin cytoskeleton, has the unexpected function of specifically inhibiting DE-cadherin transcription. Follicle cells that are mutant for talin show a strikingly high level of DE-cadherin, due to elevated transcription of DE-cadherin. We demonstrate that this deregulation of DE-cadherin is sufficient to attract the oocyte to lateral and anterior positions. Surprisingly, this function of talin is independent of integrins.

Extended longevity and insulin signaling in adipose tissue,16125891,10.1016/j.exger.2005.07.004,"Caloric restriction and leanness have been shown to increase longevity in organisms ranging from yeast to mammals. Adipose tissue seems to be a pivotal organ in the aging process and in determination of lifespan. We have recently shown that fat-specific disruption of the insulin receptor gene is sufficient to increase lifespan in FIRKO mice, suggesting that reduced adiposity, even in the presence of normal or increased food intake, can extend lifespan. The model also suggests a special role for the insulin-signaling pathway in adipose tissue in the longevity process. Reduced fat mass has an impact on the duration of life in several other model organisms. In Drosophila, a specific reduction in the fat body through overexpression of forkhead type transcription factor (dFOXO) extends lifespan. Furthermore, sirtuin1 (SIRT1), the mammalian ortholog of the life-extending yeast gene silent information regulator 2 (SIR2), was proposed to be involved in the molecular mechanisms linking lifespan to adipose tissue. In the control of human aging and longevity, one of the striking physiological characteristics identified in centenarians is their greatly increased insulin sensitivity even compared with younger individuals. The effect of reduced adipose tissue mass on lifespan could be due to the prevention of obesity-related metabolic disorders including type 2 diabetes and atherosclerosis.",2005,"Matthias Blüher, Nora Klöting"
Regulation of polarized extension and planar cell polarity in the cochlea by the vertebrate PCP pathway,16116426,10.1038/ng1622,"The mammalian auditory sensory organ, the organ of Corti, consists of sensory hair cells with uniformly oriented stereocilia on the apical surfaces and has a distinct planar cell polarity (PCP) parallel to the sensory epithelium. It is not certain how this polarity is achieved during differentiation. Here we show that the organ of Corti is formed from a thicker and shorter postmitotic primordium through unidirectional extension, characteristic of cellular intercalation known as convergent extension. Mutations in the PCP pathway interfere with this extension, resulting a shorter and wider cochlea as well as misorientation of stereocilia. Furthermore, parallel to the homologous pathway in Drosophila melanogaster, a mammalian PCP component Dishevelled2 shows PCP-dependent polarized subcellular localization across the organ of Corti. Taken together, these data suggest that there is a conserved molecular mechanism for PCP pathways in invertebrates and vertebrates and indicate that the mammalian PCP pathway might directly couple cellular intercalations to PCP establishment in the cochlea.",2005,"Xiaohui Zhang, Dong Qian, Ping Chen, Anthony Wynshaw-Boris, Andres Collazo, Seung-Jong Yoo, Xi Lin, Yanping Zhang, Kristen Radde-Gallwitz, Jianbo Wang, Sharayne Mark"

Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II alters structural plasticity and cytoskeletal dynamics in Drosophila,16192377,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2005-05.2005,"Drosophila dendritic arborization (da) neurons contain subclasses of neurons with distinct dendritic morphologies. We investigated calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) regulation of dendritic structure and dynamics in vivo using optically transparent Drosophila larvae. CaMKII increases the dynamic nature and formation of dendritic filopodia throughout larval development but only affects neurons that normally contain dendritic filopodia. In parallel, we examined the effects of Rac1 activity on dendritic structure to explore signaling specificity. In contrast to CaMKII activity, Rac1 does not alter filopodia stability but instead causes de novo filopodia formation on all da neurons. Although both mediators increase cytoskeletal turnover, measured by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments, only CaMKII increases the dynamic nature of dendritic filopodia. CaMKII signaling thus appears to use mechanisms and machinery distinct from Rac1 signaling. This study illustrates a molecular means of uncoupling cytoskeletal regulation from morphological regulation. Our results suggest that Drosophila dendritic filopodia may share some cytoskeletal regulatory mechanisms with mammalian dendritic filopodia. Furthermore, general dendrite cytoskeletal compartmentalization is conserved in multipolar neurons.",2005,"Ryan Andersen, Yimei Li, Jay E Brenman, Mary Resseguie"
Tumor suppressor properties of the ESCRT-II complex component Vps25 in Drosophila,16256745,10.1016/j.devcel.2005.09.020,"We have found that the Drosophila gene vps25 possesses several properties of a tumor suppressor. First, vps25 mutant cells activate Notch and Dpp receptor signaling, inducing ectopic organizers in developing eyes and limbs and consequent overproliferation of both mutant and nearby wild-type cells. Second, as the mutant cells proliferate, they lose their epithelial organization and undergo apoptosis. Strikingly, when apoptosis of mutant cells is blocked, tumor-like overgrowths are formed that are capable of metastasis. vps25 encodes a component of the ESCRT-II complex, which sorts membrane proteins into multivesicular bodies during endocytic trafficking to the lysosome. Activation of Notch and Dpp receptor signaling in mutant cells results from an endocytic blockage that causes accumulation of these receptors and other signaling components in endosomes. These results highlight the importance of endocytic trafficking in regulating signaling and epithelial organization and suggest a possible role for ESCRT components in human cancer.",2005,"Stephen M Cohen, Juliette Mathieu, Barry J Thompson, Pernille Rørth, Hsin-Ho Sung, Eva Loeser"
Isolation of mRNA from specific tissues of Drosophila by mRNA tagging,16204451,10.1093/nar/gni149,"To study the function of specific cells or tissues using genomic tools like microarray analyses, it is highly desirable to obtain mRNA from a homogeneous source. However, this is particularly challenging for small organisms, like Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster. We have optimized and applied a new technique, mRNA tagging, to isolate mRNA from specific tissues of D.melanogaster. A FLAG-tagged poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) is expressed in a specific tissue and mRNA from that tissue is thus tagged by the recombinant PABP and separated from mRNA in other tissues by co-immunoprecipitation with a FLAG-tag specific antibody. The fractionated mRNA is then amplified and used as probe in microarray experiments. As a test system, we employed the procedures to identify genes expressed in Drosophila photoreceptor cells. We found that most known photoreceptor cell-specific mRNAs were identified by mRNA tagging.

To determine whether pericentrin is required for ciliogenesis in mammals, we generated and analyzed mice with a hypomorphic mutation of Pcnt encoding the mouse pericentrin. Immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated that olfactory cilia of chemosensory neurons in the nasal olfactory epithelium were malformed in the homozygous mutant mice. On the other hand, the assembly of motile and primary cilia of non-neuronal epithelial cells and the formation of sperm flagella were not affected in the Pcnt-mutant mice. The defective assembly of olfactory cilia in the mutant was apparent from birth. The mutant animals displayed reduced olfactory performance in agreement with the compromised assembly of olfactory cilia.

The neuro-ecology of resource localization in Drosophila: behavioral components of perception and search,19218831,10.4161/fly.3.1.7775,"From the moment an adult fruit fly ecloses, its primary objective in life is to disperse and locate the source of an attractive food odor upon which to feed and reproduce. The evolution of flight has greatly enhanced the success of fruit flies specifically and insects more generally. Control of flight by Drosophila melanogaster is unequivocally visual. Strong optomotor reflexes towards translatory and rotational visual flow stabilize forward flight trajectory, altitude and speed. The steering responses to translatory and rotational flow in particular are mediated by computationally separate neural circuits in the fly's visual system, and gaze-stabilizing body saccades are elicited by threshold integration of expanding visual flow. However, visual information is not alone sufficient to enable a fruit fly to recognize and locate an appropriately smelly object due in part to the relatively poor resolution of its compound eyes. Rather, the animal uses an acute sense of smell to actively track odors during flight. Without a finely adapted olfactory system, the fly's remarkable visual capabilities are for naught. The relative importance of vision is apparent in the cross-modal fusion of the two modalities for stable active odor tracking. Olfactory processing in Drosophila is shaped by ecological and functional forces which are inextricably linked. Thus physiologists seeking the functional determinants of olfactory coding as well as ecologists seeking to understand the mechanisms of speciation do well to consider each others' point of view. Here we synthesize a broad perspective that integrates across ultimate and proximate mechanisms of odor tracking in Drosophila.",2009,"Mark A Frye, Dawnis M Chow"

Notch and Prospero repress proliferation following cyclin E overexpression in the Drosophila bristle lineage,19662164,10.1371/journal.pgen.1000594,"Understanding the mechanisms that coordinate cell proliferation, cell cycle arrest, and cell differentiation is essential to address the problem of how ""normal"" versus pathological developmental processes take place. In the bristle lineage of the adult fly, we have tested the capacity of post-mitotic cells to re-enter the cell cycle in response to the overexpression of cyclin E. We show that only terminal cells in which the identity is independent of Notch pathway undergo extra divisions after CycE overexpression. Our analysis shows that the responsiveness of cells to forced proliferation depends on both Prospero, a fate determinant, and on the level of Notch pathway activity. Our results demonstrate that the terminal quiescent state and differentiation are regulated by two parallel mechanisms acting simultaneously on fate acquisition and cell cycle progression.",2009,"Françoise Simon, Michel Gho, Agnès Audibert, Pierre Fichelson"
The nuclear transport machinery as a regulator of Drosophila development,19508860,10.1016/j.semcdb.2009.02.006,"The developmental processes that give rise to the animal body plan are exceedingly complex. Model systems such as Drosophila melanogaster have yielded profound insight into roles of conserved genes and genetic pathways in development. Drosophila development begins with the formation of sperm and eggs, and proceeds through several morphologically distinct stages including development of the early embryo, larval instars, formation of pupae, and differentiation of adult tissues. The nuclear transport of proteins and RNAs represents a critical step in the regulation of gene expression during every stage of development and tissue differentiation. Studies of the nuclear transport machinery in Drosophila refute the notion that nuclear transport is strictly a housekeeping process without specific regulatory roles in development. Rather, they support the idea that the basal nuclear transport machinery has adapted during the evolution of the metazoan body plan to play important regulatory roles in key developmental events.",2009,"David S Goldfarb, D Adam Mason"
A bag-of-words approach for Drosophila gene expression pattern annotation,19383139,10.1186/1471-2105-10-119,"Background: Drosophila gene expression pattern images document the spatiotemporal dynamics of gene expression during embryogenesis. A comparative analysis of these images could provide a fundamentally important way for studying the regulatory networks governing development. To facilitate pattern comparison and searching, groups of images in the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project (BDGP) high-throughput study were annotated with a variable number of anatomical terms manually using a controlled vocabulary. Considering that the number of available images is rapidly increasing, it is imperative to design computational methods to automate this task. Results: We present a computational method to annotate gene expression pattern images automatically. The proposed method uses the bag-of-words scheme to utilize the existing information on pattern annotation and annotates images using a model that exploits correlations among terms. The proposed method can annotate images individually or in groups (e.g., according to the developmental stage). In addition, the proposed method can integrate information from different two-dimensional views of embryos. Results on embryonic patterns from BDGP data demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms other methods. Conclusion: The proposed bag-of-words scheme is effective in representing a set of annotations assigned to a group of images, and the model employed to annotate images successfully captures the correlations among different controlled vocabulary terms. The integration of existing annotation information from multiple embryonic views improves annotation performance.",2009,"Sudhir Kumar, Jieping Ye, Ying-Xin Li, Shuiwang Ji, Zhi-Hua Zhou"

Results: Genome fragments containing footprints were supplied to a pipeline that constructed a position weight matrix (PWM) for different motif lengths and selected the optimal PWM. Fragments were aligned with the SeSiMCMC sampler and a new heuristic algorithm, Bigfoot. Footprints with missing hits were found for approximately 50% of factors. Adding only 2 bp on both sides of a footprinting fragment recovered most hits. We automatically constructed motifs for 41 Drosophila factors.

Cost-effective strategies for completing the interactome,19079254,10.1038/nmeth.1283,"Comprehensive protein-interaction mapping projects are underway for many model species and humans. A key step in these projects is estimating the time, cost and personnel required for obtaining an accurate and complete map. Here we modeled the cost of interaction-map completion for various experimental designs. We showed that current efforts may require up to 20 independent tests covering each protein pair to approach completion. We explored designs for reducing this cost substantially, including prioritization of protein pairs, probability thresholding and interaction prediction. The best experimental designs lowered cost by fourfold overall and >100-fold in early stages of mapping. We demonstrate the best strategy in an ongoing project in Drosophila melanogaster, in which we mapped 450 high-confidence interactions using 47 microtiter plates, versus thousands of plates expected using current designs.

Cytokine signaling mediates UV-induced nociceptive sensitization in Drosophila larvae,19375319,10.1016/j.cub.2009.03.062,"Background: Heightened nociceptive (pain) sensitivity is an adaptive response to tissue damage and serves to protect the site of injury. Multiple mediators of nociceptive sensitization have been identified in vertebrates, but the complexity of the vertebrate nervous system and tissue-repair responses has hindered identification of the precise roles of these factors. Results: Here we establish a new model of nociceptive sensitization in Drosophila larvae, in which UV-induced tissue damage alters an aversive withdrawal behavior. We find that UV-treated larvae develop both thermal hyperalgesia, manifested as an exaggerated response to noxious thermal stimuli, and thermal allodynia, a responsiveness to subthreshold thermal stimuli that are not normally perceived as noxious. Allodynia is dependent upon a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) homolog, Eiger, released from apoptotic epidermal cells, and the TNF receptor, Wengen, expressed on nociceptive sensory neurons. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that cytokine-mediated nociceptive sensitization is conserved across animal phyla and set the stage for a sophisticated genetic dissection of the cellular and molecular alterations responsible for development of nociceptive sensitization in sensory neurons.",2009,"Daniel T Babcock, Christian Landry, Michael J Galko"
The spindle matrix through the cell cycle in Drosophila,19690461,,"A spindle matrix has long been proposed to provide structural support for counterbalancing force production and a substrate for essential mitotic factors. For years the molecular identity of such a structure remained elusive. Recently a complex of nuclear proteins that reorganize into a spindle-like structure during prophase through metaphase that shows characteristics of a spindle matrix has been identified in Drosophila. We review how these results support the concept of a spindle matrix and discuss its possible function(s) during mitosis. Importantly, these molecules also appear to play critical roles during interphase in nuclear organization and function. Given that during cell division the entire nucleus undergoes a dynamic and tightly orchestrated reorganization, the reorganization of spindle matrix components during mitosis may comprise one phase of a continuum of ""nuclear architectural remodeling events"" that can be considered to extend throughout the entire cell cycle, even in the absence of a defined nucleus.",2009,"Kristen M Johansen, Jørgen Johansen"
Intraspecific polymorphism to interspecific divergence: genetics of pigmentation in Drosophila,19900891,10.1126/science.1176980,"Genetic changes contributing to phenotypic differences within or between species have been identified for a handful of traits, but the relationship between alleles underlying intraspecific polymorphism and interspecific divergence is largely unknown. We found that noncoding changes in the tan gene, as well as changes linked to the ebony gene, contribute to pigmentation divergence between closely related Drosophila species. Moreover, we found that alleles linked to tan and ebony fixed in one Drosophila species also contribute to variation within another species, and that multiple genotypes underlie similar phenotypes even within the same population. These alleles appear to predate speciation, which suggests that standing genetic variation present in the common ancestor gave rise to both intraspecific polymorphism and interspecific divergence.",2009,"Lisa L Arnold, Belinda K Haerum, Saleh Akhras, Gabriel Smith-Winberry, Adam H Neidert, Emma E Stewart, Elizabeth M Thompson, Laura Shefner, Patricia J Wittkopp"
Shaker and Shal mediate transient calcium-independent potassium current in a Drosophila flight motoneuron,19828724,10.1152/jn.00693.2009,"Ionic currents underlie the firing patterns, excitability, and synaptic integration of neurons. Despite complete sequence information in multiple species, our knowledge about ion channel function in central neurons remains incomplete. This study analyzes the potassium currents of an identified Drosophila flight motoneuron, MN5, in situ. MN5 exhibits four different potassium currents, two fast-activating transient ones and two sustained ones, one of each is calcium activated. Pharmacological and genetic manipulations unravel the specific contributions of Shaker and Shal to the calcium independent transient A-type potassium currents. alpha-dendrotoxin (Shaker specific) and phrixotoxin-2 (Shal specific) block different portions of the transient calcium independent A-type potassium current. Following targeted expression of a Shaker dominant negative transgene in MN5, the remaining A-type potassium current is alpha-dendrotoxin insensitive. In Shal RNAi knock down the remaining A-type potassium current is phrixotoxin-2 insensitive. Additionally, barium blocks calcium-activated potassium currents but also a large portion of phrixotoxin-2-sensitive A-type currents. Targeted knock down of Shaker or Shal channels each cause identical reduction in total potassium current amplitude as acute application of alpha-dendrotoxin or phrixotoxin-2, respectively. This shows that the knock downs do not cause upregulation of potassium channels underlying other A-type channels during development. Immunocytochemistry and targeted expression of modified GFP-tagged Shaker channels with intact targeting sequence in MN5 indicate predominant axonal localization. These data can now be used to investigate the roles of Shaker and Shal for motoneuron intrinsic properties, synaptic integration, and spiking output during behavior by targeted genetic manipulations.",2009,"Stefanie Ryglewski, Carsten Duch"
Activity-dependent modulation of neural circuit synaptic connectivity,19668708,10.3389/neuro.02.008.2009,"In many nervous systems, the establishment of neural circuits is known to proceed via a two-stage process; (1) early, activity-independent wiring to produce a rough map characterized by excessive synaptic connections, and (2) subsequent, use-dependent pruning to eliminate inappropriate connections and reinforce maintained synapses. In invertebrates, however, evidence of the activity-dependent phase of synaptic refinement has been elusive, and the dogma has long been that invertebrate circuits are ""hard-wired"" in a purely activity-independent manner. This conclusion has been challenged recently through the use of new transgenic tools employed in the powerful Drosophila system, which have allowed unprecedented temporal control and single neuron imaging resolution. These recent studies reveal that activity-dependent mechanisms are indeed required to refine circuit maps in Drosophila during precise, restricted windows of late-phase development. Such mechanisms of circuit refinement may be key to understanding a number of human neurological diseases, including developmental disorders such as Fragile X syndrome (FXS) and autism, which are hypothesized to result from defects in synaptic connectivity and activity-dependent circuit function. This review focuses on our current understanding of activity-dependent synaptic connectivity in Drosophila, primarily through analyzing the role of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) in the Drosophila FXS disease model. The particular emphasis of this review is on the expanding array of new genetically-encoded tools that are allowing cellular events and molecular players to be dissected with ever greater precision and detail.",2009,"Kendal Broadie, Charles R Tessier"
Drosophila argonaute1 and argonaute2 employ distinct mechanisms for translational repression,19268617,10.1016/j.molcel.2009.02.010,"microRNAs induce translational repression by binding to partially complementary sites on their target mRNAs. We have established an in vitro system that recapitulates translational repression mediated by the two Drosophila Argonaute (Ago) subfamily proteins, Ago1 and Ago2. We find that Ago1-RISC (RNA-induced silencing complex) represses translation primarily by ATP-dependent shortening of the poly(A) tail of its mRNA targets. Ago1-RISC can also secondarily block a step after cap recognition. In contrast, Ago2-RISC competitively blocks the interaction of eIF4E with eIF4G and inhibits the cap function.

Antimutagenic effect of sage tea in the wing spot test of Drosophila melanogaster,19022328,10.1016/j.fct.2008.10.024,"The present study assayed the antimutagenic potential of Salvia officinalis (sage) in the form of tea infusion, by the somatic mutation and recombination test (SMART) on Drosophila melanogaster. The use of herbal infusions is much common in the human diet, so the aim of the present study was to estimate the antimutagenic effects of the S. officinalis tea rather than essential oils. Methyl methanesulphonate (MMS) was used as the mutagen and positive control. Several types of treatment were performed: short acute treatment with sage infusion or MMS, longer (chronic) treatment with sage solution or MMS, and two combined treatments, i.e. short treatment with sage followed by a longer treatment with MMS and vice versa. Sage infusion used in our experiments showed a clear antimutagenic effect, reducing the frequency of mutations induced by MMS. The inhibition effect of sage tea is obtained and confirmed when pre- or post-treatments with mutagen were used. The results indicate that although sage in this regime decreases the number of mutation events, it is not efficient enough in case of the 2 h sage pre-treatment. Antioxidant activity, suppression of metabolic activation, could be mechanisms through which sage or some of its components act as desmutagen.",2009,"Aleksandra Patenkovic, Tijana Banjanac, Marko Andjelkovic, Marina Stamenkovic-Radak"
Exploring the functional interaction between POSH and ALIX and the relevance to HIV-1 release,19393081,10.1186/1471-2091-10-12,"Background: The ALG2-interacting protein X (ALIX)/AIP1 is an adaptor protein with multiple functions in intracellular protein trafficking that plays a central role in the biogenesis of enveloped viruses. The ubiquitin E3-ligase POSH (plenty of SH3) augments HIV-1 egress by facilitating the transport of Gag to the cell membrane. Recently, it was reported, that POSH interacts with ALIX and thereby enhances ALIX mediated phenotypes in Drosophila. Results: In this study we identified ALIX as a POSH ubiquitination substrate in human cells: POSH induces the ubiquitination of ALIX that is modified on several lysine residues in vivo and in vitro. This ubiquitination does not destabilize ALIX, suggesting a regulatory function. As it is well established that ALIX rescues virus release of L-domain mutant HIV-1, HIV-1DeltaPTAP, we demonstrated that wild type POSH, but not an ubiquitination inactive RING finger mutant (POSHV14A), substantially enhances ALIX-mediated release of infectious virions derived from HIV-1DeltaPTAP L-domain mutant (YPXnL-dependent HIV-1). In further agreement with the idea of a cooperative function of POSH and ALIX, mutating the YPXnL-ALIX binding site in Gag completely abrogated augmentation of virus release by overexpression of POSH. However, the effect of the POSH-mediated ubiquitination appears to be auxiliary, but not necessary, as silencing of POSH by RNAi does not disturb ALIX-augmentation of virus release. Conclusion: Thus, the cumulative results identified ALIX as an ubiquitination substrate of POSH and indicate that POSH and ALIX cooperate to facilitate efficient virus release. However, while ALIX is obligatory for the release of YPXnL-dependent HIV-1, POSH, albeit rate-limiting, may be functionally interchangeable.",2009,"Torsten Walther, Vivian Shemesh, Daniel Taglicht, Ulrich Schubert, Jörg Votteler, Elena Iavnilovitch, Omri Erez, Stefan Sörgel, Yuval Reiss, Norbert Bannert, Orit Fingrut"
Kekkon5 is an extracellular regulator of BMP signaling,19013143,10.1016/j.ydbio.2008.10.002,"Precise spatial and temporal control of Drosophila Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling is achieved by a host of extracellular factors that modulate ligand distribution and activity. Here we describe Kekkon5 (Kek5), a transmembrane protein containing leucine-rich repeats (LRRs), as a novel regulator of BMP signaling in Drosophila. We find that loss or gain of kek5 disrupts crossvein development and alters the early profile of phosphorylated Mad and dSRF in presumptive crossvein cells. kek5 phenotypic effects closely mimic those observed with Short gastrulation (Sog), but do not completely recapitulate the effects of dominant negative BMP receptors. We further demonstrate that Kek5 is able to antagonize the BMP ligand Glass bottom boat (Gbb) and that the Kek5 LRRs are required for BMP inhibitory activity, while the Ig domain is dispensable in this context. Our identification of Kek5 as a modulator of BMP signaling supports the emerging notion that LIG proteins function as diverse regulators of cellular communication.",2009,"Joseph B Duffy, Timothy A Evans, Harita Haridas"
The effect of inbreeding on fluctuating asymmetry of wing veins in two laboratory strains of Drosophila melanogaster,19277055,10.1038/hdy.2009.13,"Many authors have proposed that inbreeding destabilizes developmental processes. This destabilization may be reflected by increased fluctuating asymmetry (FA) in inbred compared to relatively outbred populations, but many studies have failed to find such differences. We measured the left and right wings of a large number of individual Drosophila melanogaster from two genetically distinct populations to estimate changes in FA caused by inbreeding. The large sample size and experimental design allowed removal of potentially confounding directional asymmetry (DA) and measurement error terms. Trait means in the two populations were essentially unchanged by inbreeding (less than 0.5% smaller in both populations). Inbred lines showed higher signed FA variances (16 and 38% higher, significantly so in one population) and higher unsigned FA means (3.7 and 13.2%, significantly increased in one population). Significant DA was found in both populations, although the pattern differed between populations. DA did not change due to inbreeding.",2009,"D Houle, A J R Carter, T M Weier"
Kinase-activity-independent functions of atypical protein kinase C in Drosophila,19789180,10.1242/jcs.052514,"Polarity of many cell types is controlled by a protein complex consisting of Bazooka/PAR-3 (Baz), PAR-6 and atypical protein kinase C (aPKC). In Drosophila, the Baz-PAR-6-aPKC complex is required for the control of cell polarity in the follicular epithelium, in ectodermal epithelia and neuroblasts. aPKC is the main signaling component of this complex that functions by phosphorylating downstream targets, while the PDZ domain proteins Baz and PAR-6 control the subcellular localization and kinase activity of aPKC. We compared the mutant phenotypes of an aPKC null allele with those of four novel aPKC alleles harboring point mutations that abolish the kinase activity or the binding of aPKC to PAR-6. We show that these point alleles retain full functionality in the control of follicle cell polarity, but produce strong loss-of-function phenotypes in embryonic epithelia and neuroblasts. Our data, combined with molecular dynamics simulations, show that the kinase activity of aPKC and its ability to bind PAR-6 are only required for a subset of its functions during development, revealing tissue-specific differences in the way that aPKC controls cell polarity.",2009,"Karen Fricke, Stefan Luschnig, Ieva Gailite, Maik Goette, Bernard Moussian, Soya Kim, Helmut Grubmüller, Mona Honemann-Capito, Andreas Wodarz"
Odorant and pheromone receptors in insects,19826623,10.3389/neuro.03.010.2009,"Since the emergence of the first living cells, survival has hinged on the ability to detect and localize chemicals in the environment. Modern animal species ranging from insects to mammals express large odorant receptor repertoires to detect the structurally diverse array of volatile molecules important for survival. Despite the essential nature of chemical detection, there is surprising diversity in the signaling mechanisms that different species use for odorant detection. In vertebrates, odorant receptors are classical G-protein coupled, seven transmembrane receptors that activate downstream effector enzymes that, in turn, produce second messengers that open ion channels. However, recent work reveals that insects have adopted different strategies to detect volatile chemicals. In Drosophila, the odorant receptors, predicted to have seven transmembrane domains, have reversed membrane topology compared to classical G-protein coupled receptors. Furthermore, insect odorant receptors appear to form odorant-gated ion channels. Pheromone detection in insects is even more unusual, utilizing soluble, extracellular receptors that undergo conformational activation. These alternate olfactory signaling strategies are discussed in terms of receptor design principles.",2009,"Tal Soo Ha, Dean P Smith"
SWI/SNF associates with nascent pre-mRNPs and regulates alternative pre-mRNA processing,19424417,10.1371/journal.pgen.1000470,"The SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes regulate the transcription of many genes by remodeling nucleosomes at promoter regions. In Drosophila, SWI/SNF plays an important role in ecdysone-dependent transcription regulation. Studies in human cells suggest that Brahma (Brm), the ATPase subunit of SWI/SNF, regulates alternative pre-mRNA splicing by modulating transcription elongation rates. We describe, here, experiments that study the association of Brm with transcribed genes in Chironomus tentans and Drosophila melanogaster, the purpose of which was to further elucidate the mechanisms by which Brm regulates pre-mRNA processing. We show that Brm becomes incorporated into nascent Balbiani ring pre-mRNPs co-transcriptionally and that the human Brm and Brg1 proteins are associated with RNPs. We have analyzed the expression profiles of D. melanogaster S2 cells in which the levels of individual SWI/SNF subunits have been reduced by RNA interference, and we show that depletion of SWI/SNF core subunits changes the relative abundance of alternative transcripts from a subset of genes. This observation, and the fact that a fraction of Brm is not associated with chromatin but with nascent pre-mRNPs, suggest that SWI/SNF affects pre-mRNA processing by acting at the RNA level. Ontology enrichment tests indicate that the genes that are regulated post-transcriptionally by SWI/SNF are mostly enzymes and transcription factors that regulate postembryonic developmental processes. In summary, the data suggest that SWI/SNF becomes incorporated into nascent pre-mRNPs and acts post-transcriptionally to regulate not only the amount of mRNA synthesized from a given promoter but also the type of alternative transcript produced.",2009,"David Brodin, Jessica Ryme, Neus Visa, Anu Tyagi, Ann Kristin Ostlund Farrants"
SoxF is part of a novel negative-feedback loop in the wingless pathway that controls proliferation in the Drosophila wing disc,19176582,10.1242/dev.032854,"Wnt molecules act as mitogenic signals during the development of multiple organs, and the aberrant activity of their pathway is often associated with cancer.

We have investigated the mechanisms of this regulation in the Drosophila hinge, a domain within the wing imaginal disc that depends on the fly Wnt1 ortholog wingless (wg) for its proliferation. Our results uncover a new feedback loop in the wg pathway in which the spatially restricted activation of the Sox gene SoxF (Sox15) by wg represses its own transcription, thus ensuring tight regulation of growth control. rotund, a wing proximodistal patterning gene, excludes SoxF from a thin rim of cells. These cells are thus allowed to express wg and act as the source of mitogenic signal.

In mammals, one of the Mad homologs, MADH2 (also termed Smad2), was reported to be a mediator of TGF-beta and activin signaling and was found mutated in some of the colon and lung cancer cases. We describe here the genomic organization of the human MADH2 gene. The gene is composed of 12 exons; 2 exons 1, i.e., exon 1a and 1b, are used separately or in conjunction to form exon 1a-exon 1b-exon 2 alternatively spliced mRNA. The 2 exons 1 are closely located, and the MADH2 mRNAs are transcribed from two promoters in one CpG island. The promoter activity in the 5' upstream sequence was confirmed by the luciferase assay. The 3' end of the mRNA is heterogenous, and we found several polyadenylation signals. Northern blot analysis revealed high expression of the MADH2 mRNA, e.g., in skeletal muscle, heart, and placenta.

Adult fitness consequences of sexual selection in Drosophila melanogaster,9724765,10.1073/pnas.95.18.10687,"Few experiments have demonstrated a genetic correlation between the process of sexual selection and fitness benefits in offspring, either through female choice or male competition. Those that have looked at the relationship between female choice and offspring fitness have focused on juvenile fitness components, rather than fitness at later stages in the life cycle.

To test for a relationship between sexual selection and adult fitness, we carried out an artificial selection experiment in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. We created two treatments that varied in the level of opportunity for sexual selection. Increased opportunity for female choice and male competition was genetically correlated with an increase in adult survivorship, as well as an increase in male and female body size.

A full-length cDNA segment representing the mRNA of Scl is 8503 bp and encodes a protein of 2653 amino acids, which shares 73.6% identity with Notch. All functional motifs including EGF-like repeats, LNR repeats, cdc 10/ankyrin repeats, opa and PEST elements are present in the same order as in Notch and the sequence identities peak in these motifs. With respect to genomic structure, intron/exon boundaries are conserved but, in most cases, the Scl introns are larger. Sequence analysis of the upstream genomic region reveals that the gene has a TATA-less promoter. Consistent with a central role in embryogenesis and imaginal development, high levels of Scl expression were detected in the early embryonic and pupal stages.",1998,"T Newsome, J A McKenzie, P Batterham, Z Chen"
Mitochondrial DNA haplotype frequencies in natural and experimental populations of Drosophila subobscura,9649527,,"The evolution of Drosophila subobscura mitochondrial DNA has been studied in experimental populations, founded with flies from a natural population from Esporles (Majorca, Balearic Islands, Spain). This population, like other European ones, is characterized by the presence of two very common (>96%) mitochondrial haplotypes (called I and II) and rare and endemic haplotypes that appear at very low frequencies. There is no statistical evidence of positive Darwinian selection acting on the mitochondrial DNA variants according to Tajima's neutrality test. Two experimental populations, with one replicate each, were established with flies having a heterogeneous nuclear genetic background, which was representative of the composition of the natural population. Both populations were started with the two most frequent mitochondrial haplotypes, but at different initial frequencies. After 13 to 16 generations, haplotype II reached fixation in three cages and its frequency was 0.89 by generation 25 in the fourth cage. Random drift can be rejected as the force responsible for the observed changes in haplotype frequencies. There is not only statistical evidence of a linear trend favoring a mtDNA (haploid) fitness effect, but also of a significant nonlinear deviation that could be due to a nuclear component.",1998,"M Ramón, A Latorre, J A Castro, J García-Martínez, A Moya"
The role of gene conversion in determining sequence variation and divergence in the Est-5 gene family in Drosophila pseudoobscura,9475741,,"Nucleotide sequences of eight Est-5A and Est-5C genes corresponding to previously sequenced Est-5B genes in Drosophila pseudoobscura were determined to compare patterns of polymorphism and divergence among members of this small gene family. The three esterase genes were also sequenced from D. persimilis and D. miranda for interspecific comparisons. The data provide evidence that gene conversion between loci contributes to polymorphism and to the homogenization of the Est5 genes. For Est-5B, which encodes one of the most highly polymorphic proteins in Drosophila, 12% of the segregating amino acid variants appear to have been introduced via gene conversion from other members of the gene family. Interlocus gene conversion can also explain high sequence similarity, especially at synonymous sites, between Est-5B and Est-5A. Tests of neutrality using interspecific comparisons show that levels of polymorphism conform to neutral expectations at each Est-5 locus. However, McDonald-Kreitman tests based on intraspecific gene comparisons indicate that positive selection on amino acids has accompanied Est-5 gene duplication and divergence in D. pseudoobscura.",1998,L M King
14-3-3 proteins in neuronal development and function,9626666,10.1007/BF02741386,"The 14-3-3 proteins are small, cytosolic, evolutionarily conserved proteins expressed abundantly in the nervous system. Although they were discovered more than 30 yr ago, their function in the nervous system has remained enigmatic. Several recent studies have helped to clarify their biological function. Crystallographic investigations have revealed that 14-3-3 proteins exist as dimers and that they contain a specific region for binding to other proteins. The interacting proteins, in turn, contain a 14-3-3 binding motif; proteins that interact with 14-3-3 dimers include PKC and Raf, protein kinases with critical roles in neuronal signaling. These proteins are capable of activating Raf in vitro, and this role has been verified by in vivo studies in Drosophila. Most interestingly, mutations in the Drosophila 14-3-3 genes disrupt neuronal differentiation, synaptic plasticity, and behavioral plasticity, establishing a role for these proteins in the development and function of the nervous system.",1998,"E M Skoulakis, R L Davis"
Activating properties of cocaine and cocaethylene in a behavioral preparation of Drosophila melanogaster,9593105,10.1002/(SICI)1098-2396(199806)29:2<148::AID-SYN6>3.0.CO;2-7,"The use of Drosophila as a model to study the behavioral consequences of stimulant drugs was analyzed in an active preparation of decapitated Drosophila. Application of cocaine and cocaethylene to discrete nerve cord cells regulating motor programs of behavior produced striking patterns of behavioral activity in a concentration-related manner. In general, intense circling behavior and significant wing buzzing activity were distinguishable behavioral markers in flies treated with mM concentrations of cocaine or cocaethylene. The significant changes in motor behavior induced by stimulant drugs in decapitated flies were not reproduced by the application of apomorphine, a direct dopamine (DA) agonist, or octopamine, a naturally occurring transmitter in arthropods. Because both cocaine and cocaethylene interfere with DA reuptake in mammals, we characterized the role of DA receptors mediating increased stereotypy and motor behavior in flies. Coadministration of SCH-23390, a specific D1 receptor antagonist, significantly attenuated the behavior-activating properties of cocaine and cocaethylene in this active experimental preparation. Therefore, the receptor protein mediating the behavioral responses to stimulant drugs in Drosophila is pharmacologically similar to the mammalian D1 subtype. In rats, cocaine- and cocaethylene-induced behavioral activity is complex, with increasing evidence that the D1 receptor interacts significantly with N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor pathways to produce an altered behavioral phenotype. To further characterize additional receptor subtypes targeted by the actions of cocaine and cocaethylene, we pretreated flies with MK-801 and dextromethorphan. Both of these drugs are potent, selective noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonists. Interestingly, MK-801 and dextromethorphan profoundly reduced the behavior-activating properties of cocaine and cocaethylene in Drosophila. Therefore, as in rats, the NMDA (and D1) receptor pathways in this arthropod represent obligatory targets for the behavioral effects of stimulant drugs.",1998,"J M Horowitz, G Torres"
Pair-rule and gap gene mutants in the flour beetle Tribolium castaneum,9811974,10.1007/s004270050215,"Early pattern formation in the Drosophila embryo occurs in a syncytial blastoderm where communication between nuclei is unimpeded by cell walls. During the development of other insects, similar gene expression patterns are generated in a cellular environment. In Tribolium, for instance, pair-rule stripes are transiently expressed near the posterior end of the growing germ band. To elucidate how pattern formation in such a situation deviates from that of Drosophila, functional data about the genes involved are essential. In a genetic screen for Tribolium mutants affecting the larval cuticle pattern, we isolated 4 mutants (from a total of 30) which disrupt segmentation in the thorax and abdomen. Two of these mutants display clear pair-rule phenotypes. This demonstrates that not only the expression, but also the function of pair-rule genes in this short-germ insect is in principle similar to Drosophila. The other two mutants appear to identify gap genes. They provide the first evidence for the involvement of gap genes in abdominal segmentation of short-germ embryos. However, significant differences between the phenotypes of these mutants and those of known Drosophila gap mutants exist which indicates that evolutionary changes occurred in either the regulation or action of these genes.",1998,"M Klingler, G Bucher, F Maderspacher"
Expression of ciliary tektins in brain and sensory development,9786996,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.18-21-08912.1998,"Many types of neural tissues and sensory cells possess either motile or primary cilia. We report the first mammalian (murine testis) cDNA for tektin, a protein unique to cilia, flagella, and centrioles, which we have used to identify related proteins and genes in sensory tissues. Comparison with the sequence database reveals that tektins are a gene family, spanning evolution from Caenorhabditis elegans (in which they correlate with touch receptor cilia) and Drosophila melanogaster, to Mus musculus and Homo sapiens (in which they are found in brain, retina, melanocytes, and at least 13 other tissues). The peptide sequence RPNVELCRD, or a variant of it, is a prominent feature of tektins and is likely to form a functionally important protein domain. Using the cDNA as a probe, we determined the onset, relative levels, and locations of tektin expression in mouse for several adult tissues and embryonic stages by Northern blot analysis and in situ hybridization. Tektin expression is significant in adult brain and in the choroid plexus, the forming retina (primitive ependymal zone corresponding to early differentiating photoreceptor cells), and olfactory receptor neurons of stage embryonic day 14 embryos. There is a striking correlation of tektin expression with the known presence of either motile or primary cilia. The evolutionary conservation of tektins and their association with tubulin in cilia and centriole formation make them important and useful molecular targets for the study of neural development.",1998,"S Ståhl, M Larsson, J Norrander, C Höög, R Linck"
Inscuteable and numb mediate asymmetric muscle progenitor cell divisions during Drosophila myogenesis,9450926,10.1101/gad.12.3.304,"Each larval hemisegment comprises approximately 30 uniquely specified somatic muscles. These derive from muscle founders that arise as distinct sibling pairs from the division of muscle progenitor cells. We have analyzed the progenitor cell divisions of three mesodermal lineages that generate muscle (and pericardial cell) founders. Our results show that Inscuteable and Numb proteins are localized as cortical crescents on opposite sides of dividing progenitor cells. Asymmetric segregation of Numb into one of the sibling myoblasts depends on inscuteable and is essential for the specification of distinct sibling cell fates. Loss of numb or inscuteable results in opposite cell fate transformations-both prevent sibling myoblasts from adopting distinct identities, resulting in duplicated or deleted mesodermal structures. Our results indicate that the muscle progenitor cell divisions are intrinsically asymmetric; moreover, the involvement of both inscuteable and numb/N suggests that the specification of the distinct cell fates of sibling myoblasts requires intrinsic and extrinsic cues.",1998,"W Chia, B Murugasu-Oei, D Menon, F Jiménez, A Carmena"

Thus, mature females of lines 160 and 147 had different levels of JH hydrolysis under heat stress.

Dissection of the transactivation function of the transcription factor encoded by the eye developmental gene PAX6,9516413,10.1074/jbc.273.13.7210,"PAX6 is a transcription activator that regulates eye development in animals ranging from Drosophila to human. The C-terminal region of PAX6 is proline/serine/threonine-rich (PST) and functions as a potent transactivation domain when attached to a heterologous DNA-binding domain of the yeast transcription factor, GAL4. The PST region comprises 152 amino acids encoded by four exons. The transactivation function of the PST region has not been defined and characterized in detail by in vitro mutagenesis. We dissected the PST domain in two independent systems, a heterologous system using a GAL4 DNA-binding site and the native system of PAX6. Our data consistently showed that in both systems all four constituent exons of the PST domain are responsible for the transactivation function. The four exon fragments act synergistically to stimulate transcription, although none of them can function individually as an independent transactivation domain. Combinations of two or more exon fragments can reconstitute substantial transactivation activity when fused to the DNA-binding domain of GAL4, but they surprisingly do not produce much activity in the context of native PAX6, although the mutant PAX6 proteins are stable and their DNA-binding function remains unaffected. Our data suggest that these mutants may antagonize the wild-type PAX6 activity by competing for target DNA-binding sites. We conclude that the PAX6 protein contains an unusually large transactivation domain that is evolutionarily conserved to a high degree and that its full transactivation activity relies on the synergistic action of the four exon fragments.",1998,"G F Saunders, H K Tang, S Singh"
Induced chromosomal exchange directs the segregation of recombinant chromatids in mitosis of Drosophila,9725837,,"In meiosis, the segregation of chromosomes at the reductional division is accomplished by first linking homologs together. Genetic exchange generates the bivalents that direct regular chromosome segregation. We show that genetic exchange in mitosis also generates bivalents and that these bivalents direct mitotic chromosome segregation. After FLP-mediated homologous recombination in G2 of the cell cycle, recombinant chromatids consistently segregate away from each other (x segregation). This pattern of segregation also applies to exchange between heterologs. Most, or all, cases of non-x segregation are the result of exchange in G1. Cytological evidence is presented that confirms the existence of the bivalents that direct this pattern of segregation. Our results implicate sister chromatid cohesion in maintenance of the bivalent. The pattern of chromatid segregation can be altered by providing an additional FRT at a more proximal site on one chromosome. We propose that sister chromatid exchange occurs at the more proximal site, allowing the recombinant chromatids to segregate together. This also allowed the recovery of reciprocal translocations following FLP-mediated heterologous recombination. The observation that exchange can generate a bivalent in mitotic divisions provides support for a simple evolutionary relationship between mitosis and meiosis.",1998,"K J Beumer, K G Golic, S Pimpinelli"
A conserved mode of head segmentation in arthropods revealed by the expression pattern of Hox genes in a spider,9724761,10.1073/pnas.95.18.10665,"Chelicerates constitute a basic arthropod group with fossil representatives from as early as the Cambrian period. Embryonic development and the subdivision of the segmented body region into a prosoma and an opisthosoma are very similar in all extant chelicerates. The mode of head segmentation, however, has long been controversial. Although all other arthropod groups show a subdivision of the head region into six segments, the chelicerates are thought to have the first antennal segment missing. To examine this problem on a molecular level, we have compared the expression pattern of Hox genes in the spider Cupiennius salei with the pattern known from insects. Surprisingly, we find that the anterior expression borders of the Hox genes are in the same register and the same relative segmental position as in Drosophila. This contradicts the view that the homologue of the first antennal segment is absent in the spider. Instead, our data suggest that the cheliceral segment is homologous to the first antennal segment and the pedipalpal segment is homologous to the second antennal (or intercalary) segment in arthropods. Our finding implies that chelicerates, myriapods, crustaceans, and insects share a single mode of head segmentation, reinforcing the argument for a monophyletic origin of the arthropods.",1998,"D Tautz, W G Damen, M Hausdorf, E A Seyfarth"
"Molecular characterization of a retrotransposon in Drosophila melanogaster, nomad, and its relationship to other retrovirus-like mobile elements",9894909,10.1007/s004380050910,"The nomad element was identified as a retrovirus-like transposon in Drosophila melanogaster. DNA sequence analysis showed that the nomad element contains three long ORFs that are similar to the gag, pol and env genes of retrovirus- and the copia-like elements of D. melanogaster. The nomad element terminates with 519-bp terminal repeats, each of which contains eukaryotic consensus transcription initiation and termination signals. nomad elements are located at approximately 10-15 sites within the euchromatic arms of the genome and at the chromocenter, as shown by in situ hybridization. The host DNA sequence TANA was found to be duplicated on each side of the nomad element and appears to be a preferential target site for insertion of nomad elements. Analysis of the zinc finger motif in the pol gene product of retrotransposons known to have target site preference suggests involvement of the integrase subunit in target site selection for those retrotransposons that display insert site specificity. A comparison of the predicted amino acid sequence of the pol-like genes of several known retrotransposons was made and the phylogenetic relationship between nomad and other retrovirus-like mobile elements was determined. It was clear from this conceptual protein analysis and from analysis of their structural characteristics that retrotransposons of the gypsy class can be generally classified as members of one of two distinct groups.

We examine the rates of divergence of a species-specific courtship signal, sexual isolation, and postmating isolation in the Drosophila willistoni group. Both types of isolation increase with genetic distance and postmating isolation is the most strongly correlated with genetic divergence, suggesting this has the least variable divergence rate. Song divergence is not correlated with genetic divergence. Homoplasy in song pattern results in poorly resolved phylogenies that are different from molecular phylogenies.

The Drosophila segmentation gene runt acts as a position-specific numerator element necessary for the uniform expression of the sex-determining gene Sex-lethal,1748277,10.1101/gad.5.12a.2176,"Female development in Drosophila is established through the activation of the X:A target gene Sex-lethal (Sxl) by an X:A ratio of 1. X-linked zygotic genes, termed numerator elements, comprise part of the X:A ratio and are primarily responsible for the activation of Sxl in females. We demonstrate that the X-linked segmentation gene runt is required for this process and has genetic and molecular properties of a numerator element. Genetically, runt has vital dose-dependent interactions with components of the X:A ratio and alterations in runt activity alter the sexual phenotype of triploid intersexes. Molecularly, loss of runt activity results in a failure to activate appropriately Sxl in the central region of female embryos. We also show that Sxl activation is influenced by the maternal anterior and terminal pattern-forming genes, bicoid (bcd) and torso (tor). These results indicate that the ""uniform"" activation of Sxl requires input from nonuniformly distributed products. We have demonstrated that runt is one such product and suggest that other genes with nonuniform input exist. runt is distinguished from previously identified regulators of Sxl by its nonuniform role and by the absence of an identifiable helix-loop-helix (HLH) motif, indicating that the activation of Sxl is not controlled solely by HLH proteins.",1991,"J B Duffy, J P Gergen"
Antennapedia homeobox peptide regulates neural morphogenesis,1672046,10.1073/pnas.88.5.1864,"We synthesized the 60-amino acid polypeptide corresponding to the sequence of the Drosophila antennapedia gene homeobox.

Moreover, pAntp directly added to already differentiated neuronal cultures penetrated the cells and further augmented their morphological differentiation. Examination of live and fixed neurons in classical and confocal fluorescence microscopy demonstrated that pAntp was captured at all regions of the nerve cells and accumulated in the nuclei. In addition, the effect of pAntp on neurite extension was blocked in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. Thus, our results demonstrate that neurons possess an efficient uptake system for the antennapedia homeobox peptide and suggest that binding of pAntp to consensus motifs present in nerve cell nuclei influences neuronal morphogenetic programs.",1991,"C Pernelle, A Prochiantz, H Deagostini-Bazin, A Joliot"
Ultrastructural analysis of polytene chromatin of Drosophila melanogaster reveals clusters of tightly linked co-expressed genes,1904022,10.1007/BF00337246,"Patterns of gene activity on individual chromatids of polytene chromosomes of Drosophila melanogaster white prepupae were ultrastructurally characterized by electron microscopy. The band-interband structure of salivary gland polytene chromosomes is lost when they are dispersed in a low ionic strength detergent solution. Morphologically similar, active genes in close proximity to one another were seen in dispersed white prepupal chromatin. The arrays of genes almost certainly represent sister copies of the same locus. Although lateral register between gene copies on multiple strands was not maintained, analysis of sister transcriptional units of unknown identity was achieved at the periphery of the chromatin arrays. Juxtaposed genes with divergent transcriptional polarity were prevalent. The morphology, size and transcriptional polarity of multiple copies of short, tandemly organized, RNA polymerase dense, co-expressed gene clusters is reported. One highly transcriptionally active region, designated the white prepupal locus (WPP locus), composed of a co-expressed tandem cluster of ten genes within an approximately 50 kb region was analyzed on six separate chromatids. The transcriptional map suggests that the pattern of gene activity for at least one gene within the cluster may not be identical on all homologous strands.

"Expression of the mouse labial-like homeobox-containing genes, Hox 2.9 and Hox 1.6, during segmentation of the hindbrain",1673098,,"The sequence of a mouse Hox 2.9 cDNA clone is presented. The predicted homeodomain is similar to that of the Drosophila gene labial showing 80% identity. The equivalent gene in the Hox 1 cluster is Hox 1.6 which shows extensive similarity to Hox 2.9 both within and outside the homeodomain. Hox 2.9 and Hox 1.6 are the only two mouse members of the labial-like family of homeobox-containing genes as yet identified. Hox 2.9 has previously been shown to be expressed in a single segmental unit of the developing hindbrain (rhombomere) and has been predicted to be involved in conferring rhombomere identity. To analyse further the function of Hox 2.9 during development and to determine if the other mouse labial-like gene Hox 1.6, displays similar properties, we have investigated the expression patterns of these two genes and an additional rhombomere-specific gene, Krox 20, on consecutive embryonic sections at closely staged intervals. This detailed analysis has enabled us to draw the following conclusions: (1) There are extensive similarities in the temporal and spatial expression of Hox 2.9 and Hox 1.6, throughout the period that both genes are expressed in the embryo (7 1/2 to 10 days). At 8 days the genes occupy identical domains in the neuroectoderm and mesoderm with the same sharp anterior boundary in the presumptive hindbrain. These similarities indicate a functional relationship between the genes and further suggest that the labial-like genes are responding to similar signals in the embryo. (2) By 9 days the neuroectoderm expression of both genes retreats posteriorly along the anteroposterior (AP) axis. The difference at this stage between the expression patterns is the persistence of Hox 2.9 in a specific region of the hindbrain, illustrating the capacity of Hox 2.9 to respond to additional positional regulatory signals and indicating a unique function for this gene in the hindbrain. (3) The restriction of Hox 2.9 expression in the hindbrain occurs at 8 1/2 days, approximately the same time as Krox 20 is first detected in the posterior adjoining domain. The mutually exclusive expression of Hox 2.9 and Krox 20 demarcated by sharp expression boundaries suggest that compartmentalisation of cells within the hindbrain has occurred up to 6 h before rhombomeres (morphological segments) are clearly visible. (4) Hox 2.9 expression is confined to the region of rhombomere 4 that shows cell lineage restriction and, unlike Krox 20, is expressed throughout the period that rhombomeres are visible (to 11 1/2 days).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",1991,"P Murphy, R E Hill"

D. simulans has the combination of the centromeric parts of the chromosomes X, 2, 3 into the ""elongated"" chromocentre, and in addition, the arms of chromosomes are also separated and attached to the nuclear envelope.

Monoclonal antibody CC-3 recognizes phosphoproteins in interphase and mitotic cells,2055264,10.1016/0014-4827(91)90510-2,"Among a library of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) recognizing developmental markers in the chick embryo, mAb CC-3 was selected because of its differential immunostaining of mitotic cells. The intracellular distribution of the CC-3 antigen (CC-3a) throughout the cell cycle was visualized by immunolocalization. In interphase cells CC-3a resided in the nucleus and was arranged in distinct extranucleolar clusters. At prophase, the nuclear reactivity of CC-3a considerably increased and subsequently extended to the cytoplasm at metaphase. From metaphase through anaphase, most of the reactivity was associated with the mitotic apparatus. During cytokinesis CC-3a was detected in the mid-body and also in discrete speckles dispersed throughout the cytoplasm. The initial interphase pattern was then restored in the two daughter nuclei. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that a 255-kDa phosphoprotein was present only in the interphase nucleus and that a complete new set of phosphoproteins accounted for the mitotic cell reactivity. The binding of CC-3 was dependent on the phosphorylation of its antigens. CC-3a is an evolutionary conserved molecule; it is present in such phylogenetically distant species as Drosophila and humans. Furthermore, the unique behavior of CC-3 on sections of normal, embryonic, and regenerative tissue and in cell culture immunostaining make it a reliable tool to identify mitotic foci.",1991,"A Thibodeau, M Vincent"
Oskar organizes the germ plasm and directs localization of the posterior determinant nanos,2070417,10.1016/0092-8674(91)90137-n,"Oskar is one of seven Drosophila maternal-effect genes that are necessary for germline and abdomen formation. We have cloned oskar and show that oskar RNA is localized to the posterior pole of the oocyte when germ plasm forms. This polar distribution of oskar RNA is established during oogenesis in three phases: accumulation in the oocyte, transport toward the posterior, and finally maintenance at the posterior pole of the oocyte. The colocalization of oskar and nanos in wild-type and bicaudal embryos suggests that oskar directs localization of the posterior determinant nanos. We propose that the pole plasm is assembled stepwise and that continued interaction among its components is required for germ cell determination.",1991,"A Ephrussi, L K Dickinson, R Lehmann"

DNA replication in cell-free extracts from Drosophila melanogaster,1756740,,"We have developed an efficient in vitro replication system from 0-2 h Drosophila melanogaster embryos. Demembranated Xenopus sperm DNA when incubated in such an extract first becomes enclosed in a nucleus-like structure with a nuclear envelope and a karyoskeleton. It then undergoes one round of semiconservative replication--this replication appears completely dependent on nuclear formation. Up to 30% of input DNA is nucleated in one reaction. Efficient nuclear formation and replication are dependent on a cold treatment step, prior to disruption of the embryos. They also depend on the age of the embryos used. Extracts from older embryos (0-5 h) are capable of nuclear formation, although at a much reduced efficiency, and repair synthesis, but seem to have lost the ability to initiate DNA replication. In addition to replicating sperm DNA this system appears capable of carrying out semi-conservative replication on some plasmids. However, it cannot use these to trigger nuclear formation; replication is only seen if the plasmids are coincubated with sperm DNA. The in vitro formed nuclei have not been observed to trigger nuclear envelope breakdown and entry into mitosis. However, they can re-replicate the DNA if the nuclei are permeabilized. This system should be a useful complement to the previously isolated Xenopus in vitro replication system. In addition the amenability of Drosophila to genetic study should open up new approaches not previously possible with Xenopus.",1991,"G Crevel, S Cotterill"

Excess lunatic fringe causes cranial neural crest over-proliferation,11412032,10.1006/dbio.2001.0279,"Lunatic fringe is a vertebrate homologue of Drosophila fringe, which plays an important role in modulating Notch signaling. This study examines the distribution of chick lunatic fringe at sites of neural crest formation and explores its possible function by ectopic expression. Shortly after neural tube closure, lunatic fringe is expressed in most of the neural tube, with the exception of the dorsal midline containing presumptive neural crest. Thus, there is a fringe/non-fringe border at the site of neural crest production. Expression of excess lunatic fringe in the cranial neural tube and neural crest by retrovirally mediated gene transfer resulted in a significant increase ( approximately 60%) in the percentage of cranial neural crest cells 1 day after infection. This effect was mediated by an increase in cell division as assayed by BrdU incorporation. Infected embryos had an up-regulation of Delta-1 in the dorsal neural tube and redistribution of Notch-1 to the lumen of the neural tube, confirming that excess fringe modulates Notch signaling. These findings point to a novel role for lunatic fringe in regulating cell division and/or production of neural crest cells by the neural tube.",2001,"M Bronner-Fraser, M Barembaum, M E de Bellard, E Laufer, C Nellemann"

A construct encoding PP1beta9C with a short NH(2)-terminal fusion including six histidine residues was introduced into the X-33 and KM71H strains of P. pastoris by homologous recombination. Recombinant protein was purified from cell free extracts 24 h after methanol induction. PP1beta9C was purified to a specific activity of 12,077 mU/mg by a three-step purification method comprising (NH(4))(2)SO(4)-ethanol precipitation followed by Ni(2+)-agarose affinity chromatography and Mono Q anion-exchange chromatography. This purification scheme yielded approximately 80 microg of active, soluble PP1beta9C per 1 L of culture. In contrast to recombinant PP1beta9C overexpressed in bacteria, which differs from native PP1c in several biochemical criteria including the requirement for divalent cations, sensitivity to vanadate, and p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) phosphatase activity, recombinant PP1beta9C produced in P. pastoris has native-like properties.

An enhanced mutant of red fluorescent protein DsRed for double labeling and developmental timer of neural fiber bundle formation,11408473,10.1074/jbc.C100200200,"We developed a new variant of coral-derived red fluorescent protein, DsRed S197Y, which is brighter and essentially free from secondary fluorescence peak. This makes it an ideal reporter for double labeling with green fluorescent protein (GFP). Though purified protein shows only 20% stronger fluorescence emission, culture cells that express DsRed S197Y exhibit a 3-3.5 times higher level of fluorescence than the cells that express wild-type DsRed. The much slower fluorescence maturation of DsRed than that of GFP is a beneficial feature for a fluorescent developmental timer application. When GFP and DsRed S197Y are expressed simultaneously, emissions start at different latency. This provides information about the time after the onset of expression. It reflects the order of cell differentiation if the expression is activated upon differentiation of certain types of cells. We applied this system to the developing brain of Drosophila and visualized, for the first time, the formation order of neural fibers within a large bundle. Our results showed that newly extending fibers of the mushroom body neurons mainly run into the core rather than to the periphery of the existing bundle. DsRed-based timer thus presents an indispensable tool for developmental biology and genetics of model organisms.",2001,"H Otsuna, S Tsukita, V V Verkhusha, H Oda, K Ito, T Awasaki"

Several alternative transcripts are differentially expressed in human tissues, probably reflecting differences in cargo binding and transport of corresponding proteins. During early mouse development, its homologue (Kif13A) is expressed essentially in the central nervous system. In Caenorhabditis elegans, the unc-104 gene is involved in axonal anterograde transport, and null mutants present several behavioral defects.

Functional genomics of odor-guided behavior in Drosophila melanogaster,11238254,10.1093/chemse/26.2.215,"The avoidance response to repellent odorants in Drosophila melanogaster, a response essential for survival, provides an advantageous model for studies on the genetic architecture of olfactory behavior. Transposon tagging in a highly inbred strain of flies in combination with a rapid and simple statistical behavioral assay enables the identification of not only large phenotypic effects, but also small aberrations from wild-type avoidance behavior. The recent completion of the sequence of the Drosophila genome facilitates the molecular characterization of transposon-tagged genes and correlation between gene expression and behavior in smell-impaired (smi) mutant lines. Quantitative genetic analyses of a collection of smi lines in a co-isogenic background revealed an extensive network of epistatic interactions among genes that shape the olfactory avoidance response. Candidate genes for several of these transposon-tagged smi loci implicate genes that mediate odorant recognition, including a novel odorant binding protein; signal propagation, including a voltage-gated sodium channel; and a protein containing multiple leucine rich repeats and PDZ domains likely to be involved in postsynaptic organization in the olfactory pathway. Several novel genes of unknown function have also been implicated, including a novel tyrosine-regulated protein kinase. The discovery and characterization of novel gene products that have major, hitherto unappreciated effects on olfactory behavior will provide new insights in the generation and regulation of odor-guided behavior.

Pyrokinin/PBAN-like peptides in the central nervous system of Drosophila melanogaster,11735047,10.1007/s00441-001-0467-x,"The pyrokinin/pheromone biosynthesis activating neuropeptide (PBAN) family of peptides found in insects is characterized by a 5-amino-acid C-terminal sequence, FXPRLamide.

Recently, this family of peptides has been implicated in accelerating the formation of the puparium in a dipteran. Using bioassay and immunocytochemical techniques, we demonstrate the presence of pyrokinin/PBAN-like peptides in the central nervous system of Drosophila melanogaster.

The ring gland of both larvae and adults contained immunoreactivity. Adult brain-subesophageal ganglion complex possessed additional neurons. The fused ventral ganglia of both larvae and adults contained three pairs of neurons that sent their axons to a neurohemal organ connected to the abdominal nervous system.

The Drosophila factor (DmVEGF-1) gene has two splice variants and is expressed during all stages, the signal distribution during embryogenesis being ubiquitous. The receptor (DmVEGFR) gene has several splice variants; the variations affecting only the extracellular domain. The most prominent form is expressed in cells of the embryonic haematopoietic cell lineage, starting in the mesodermal area of the head around stage 10 of embryogenesis. Expression persists in hemocytes as embryonic development proceeds and the cells migrate posteriorly. In a fly strain carrying a deletion uncovering the DmVEGFR gene, hemocytes are still present, but their migration is hampered and the hemocytes remain mainly in the anterior end close to their origin.

Xenopus Enhancer of Zeste (XEZ); an anteriorly restricted polycomb gene with a role in neural patterning,11287189,10.1016/s0925-4773(01)00304-5,"We have identified the Xenopus homologue of Drosophila Enhancer of Zeste using a differential display strategy designed to identify genes involved in early anterior neural differentiation. XEZ codes for a protein of 748 amino acids that is very highly conserved in evolution and is 96% identical to both human and mouse EZ(H)2. In common with most other Xenopus Pc-G genes and unlike mammalian Pc-G genes, XEZ is anteriorly restricted. Zygotic expression of XEZ commences during gastrulation, much earlier than other anteriorly localized Pc-G genes; expression is restricted to the anterior neural plate and is confined later to the forebrain, eyes and branchial arches. XEZ is induced in animal caps overexpressing noggin; up-regulation of XEZ therefore represents a response to inhibition of BMP signalling in ectodermal cells. We show that the midbrain/hindbrain junction marker En-2,and hindbrain marker Krox-20, are target genes of XEZ and that XEZ functions to repress these anteroposterior marker genes. Conversely, XEZ does not repress the forebrain marker Otx-2. XEZ overexpression results in a greatly thickened floor of the forebrain.

A humoral stress response in Drosophila,11369236,10.1016/s0960-9822(01)00203-2,"The ability to react to unfavorable environmental changes is crucial for survival and reproduction, and several adaptive responses to stress have been conserved during evolution [1-3].

Furthermore, MAP kinases and other signaling factors mediate cellular responses to a very broad range of environmental insults [7-9]. Here we describe a novel systemic response to stress in Drosophila. The Turandot A (TotA) gene encodes a humoral factor, which is secreted from the fat body and accumulates in the body fluids. TotA is strongly induced upon bacterial challenge, as well as by other types of stress such as high temperature, mechanical pressure, dehydration, UV irradiation, and oxidative agents. It is also upregulated during metamorphosis and at high age. Strikingly, flies that overexpress TotA show prolonged survival and retain normal activity at otherwise lethal temperatures.

Cactus-independent nuclear translocation of Drosophila RELISH,11400160,10.1002/jcb.1144,"Insects can effectively and rapidly clear microbial infections by a variety of innate immune responses including the production of antimicrobial peptides. Induction of these antimicrobial peptides in Drosophila has been well established to involve NF-kappaB elements. We present evidence here for a molecular mechanism of Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced signaling involving Drosophila NF-kappaB, RELISH, in Drosophila S2 cells. We demonstrate that LPS induces a rapid processing event within the RELISH protein releasing the C-terminal ankyrin-repeats from the N-terminal Rel homology domain (RHD). Examination of the cellular localization of RELISH reveals that the timing of this processing coincides with the nuclear translocation of the RHD and the retention of the ankyrin-repeats within the cytoplasm. Both the processing and the nuclear translocation immediately precede the expression of antibacterial peptide genes cecropin A1, attacin, and diptericin. Over-expression of the RHD but not full-length RELISH results in an increase in the promoter activity of the cecropin A1 gene in the absence of LPS. Furthermore, the LPS-induced expression of these antibacterial peptides is greatly reduced when RELISH expression is depleted via RNA-mediated interference. In addition, loss of cactus expression via RNAi revealed that RELISH activation and nuclear translocation is not dependent on the presence of cactus. Taken together, these results suggest that this signaling mechanism involving the processing of RELISH followed by nuclear translocation of the RHD is central to the induction of at least part of the antimicrobial response in Drosophila, and is largely independent of cactus regulation.",2001,"W D Cornwell, R B Kirkpatrick"
Changes in the recombinational environment affect divergence in the yellow gene of Drosophila,11371593,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a003876,"The complete coding region of the yellow (y) gene was sequenced in different Drosophila species. In the species of the melanogaster subgroup (D. melanogaster, D. simulans, D. mauritiana, D. yakuba, and D. erecta), this gene is located at the tip of the X chromosome in a region with a strong reduction in recombination rate. In contrast, in D. ananassae (included in the ananassae subgroup of the melanogaster group) and in the obscura group species (D. subobscura, D. madeirensis, D. guanche, and D. pseudoobscura), the y gene is located in regions with normal recombination rates. As predicted by the hitchhiking and background selection models, this change in the recombinational environment affected synonymous divergence in the y-gene-coding region. Estimates of the number of synonymous substitutions per site were much lower between the obscura group species and D. ananassae than between the species of the obscura group and the melanogaster subgroup. In fact, a highly significant increase in the rate of synonymous substitution was detected in all lineages leading to the species of the melanogaster subgroup relative to the D. ananassae lineage. This increase can be explained by a higher fixation rate of mutations from preferred to unpreferred codons (slightly deleterious mutations). The lower codon bias detected in all species of the melanogaster subgroup relative to D. ananassae (or to the obscura group species) would be consistent with this proposal. Therefore, at least in Drosophila, changes in the recombination rate in different lineages might cause deviations of the molecular-clock hypothesis and contribute to the overdispersion of the rate of synonymous substitution. In contrast, the change in the recombinational environment of the y gene has no detectable effect on the rate of amino acid replacement in the Yellow protein.",2001,"M Aguade, A Munte, C Segarra"
"The genetic structure of Drosophila ananassae populations from Asia, Australia and Samoa",17237518,10.1534/genetics.106.066613,"Information about genetic structure and historical demography of natural populations is central to understanding how natural selection changes genomes. Drosophila ananassae is a widespread species occurring in geographically isolated or partially isolated populations and provides a unique opportunity to investigate population structure and molecular variation. We assayed microsatellite repeat-length variation among 13 populations of D. ananassae to assess the level of structure among the populations and to make inferences about their ancestry and historic biogeography. High levels of genetic structure are apparent among all populations, particularly in Australasia and the South Pacific, and patterns are consistent with the hypothesis that the ancestral populations are from Southeast Asia. Analysis of population structure and use of F-statistics and Bayesian analysis suggest that the range expansion of the species into the Pacific is complex, with multiple colonization events evident in some populations represented by lineages that show no evidence of recent admixture. The demographic patterns show isolation by distance among populations and population expansion within all populations. A morphologically distinct sister species, D. pallidosa, collected in Malololelei, Samoa, appears to be more closely related to some of the D. ananassae populations than many of the D. ananassae populations are to one another.

Lola regulates Drosophila olfactory projection neuron identity and targeting specificity,17634136,10.1186/1749-8104-2-14,"Background: Precise connections of neural circuits can be specified by genetic programming. In the Drosophila olfactory system, projection neurons (PNs) send dendrites to single glomeruli in the antenna lobe (AL) based upon lineage and birth order and send axons with stereotyped terminations to higher olfactory centers. These decisions are likely specified by a PN-intrinsic transcriptional code that regulates the expression of cell-surface molecules to instruct wiring specificity. Results: We find that the loss of longitudinals lacking (lola), which encodes a BTB-Zn-finger transcription factor with 20 predicted splice isoforms, results in wiring defects in both axons and dendrites of all lineages of PNs. RNA in situ hybridization and quantitative RT-PCR suggest that most if not all lola isoforms are expressed in all PNs, but different isoforms are expressed at widely varying levels. Overexpression of individual lola isoforms fails to rescue the lola null phenotypes and causes additional phenotypes. Loss of lola also results in ectopic expression of Gal4 drivers in multiple cell types and in the loss of transcription factor gene lim1 expression in ventral PNs. Conclusion: Our results indicate that lola is required for wiring of axons and dendrites of most PN classes, and suggest a need for its molecular diversity.

Isolation of regulators of Drosophila immune defense genes by a double interaction screen in yeast,17296495,10.1016/j.ibmb.2006.10.008,"Innate immunity is a universal and ancient defense system in metazoans against microorganisms. Antimicrobial peptides, which are synthesized both in insects and humans, constitute an endogenous, gene-encoded defense arsenal. In Drosophila, antimicrobial peptides, such as the potent cecropins, are expressed both constitutively in barrier epithelia, as well as systemically in response to infection. Rel/NF-kappaB proteins are well-known regulators of antimicrobial peptide genes, but very few Rel/NF-kappaB co-factors and/or tissue-specific regulators have been identified. We performed a double interaction screen in yeast to isolate Drosophila cDNAs coding for direct regulators, as well as Dif co-regulators, of the CecropinA1 gene. Three classes of positive cDNA clones corresponding to 15 Drosophila genes were isolated and further characterized. One of the Dif-independent cDNAs encoded the Rel/NF-kappaB protein Relish; a well-known activator of antimicrobial peptide genes in Drosophila, demonstrating the applicability of this type of screen for isolating regulators of immune defense. Most interestingly, three transcription factors belonging to the POU domain class of homeodomain proteins, Pdm1, Pdm2 and Dfr/Vvl were isolated as Dif-interacting partners, and subsequently verified as regulators of CecA1 expression in Drosophila cells. The importance of POU proteins in development and differentiation in Drosophila and mammals is well documented, but their role in regulation of Drosophila immune defense genes is a new and essential finding.",2007,"Leslie Pick, Hanna Uvell, Ylva Engström, Anna Junell"
Lipoprotein-heparan sulfate interactions in the Hh pathway,17609110,10.1016/j.devcel.2007.04.019,"The Drosophila lipoprotein particle, Lipophorin, bears lipid-linked morphogens on its surface and is required for long-range signaling activity of Wingless and Hedgehog. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans are also critical for trafficking and signaling of these morphogens. Here we show that Lipophorin interacts with the heparan sulfate moieties of the glypicans Dally and Dally-like. Membrane-associated glypicans can recruit Lipophorin to disc tissue, and remain associated with these particles after they are released from the membrane by cleavage of their gpi anchors. The released form of Dally colocalizes with Patched, Hedgehog, and Lipophorin in endosomes and increases Hedgehog signaling efficiency without affecting its distribution. These data suggest that heparan sulfate proteoglycans may influence lipid-linked morphogen signaling, at least in part, by binding to Lipophorin. They further suggest that the complement of proteins present on lipoprotein particles can regulate the activity of morphogens.",2007,"Ali Mahmoud, Suzanne Eaton, Christina Eugster, Daniela Panáková"
[The distribution of mitoses in the imaginal disks of third-instar Drosophila melanogaster larvae],17899811,,"Development of Drosophila imaginal discs is accompanied by a high-ordered cell proliferation.

In this work, we have analyzed the distribution of mitoses in the wing disc of third-instar larvae and determined the regions where mitotic clustering. The results obtained demonstrate that the proliferation rate is region-specific, which is determined by the location of cell cycle regulators and/or the location of growth factors. A comparison of the topography of mitoses with the activity patterns of the regulatory regions of gene string (stg), a known regulator of the mitotic M phase, has demonstrated a similarity between the topography and the activity pattern of one of these regions.

Abnormalities in cell proliferation and apico-basal cell polarity are separable in Drosophila lgl mutant clones in the developing eye,17870065,10.1016/j.ydbio.2007.08.025,"In homozygous mutants of Drosophila lethal-2-giant larvae (lgl), tissues lose apico-basal cell polarity and exhibit ectopic proliferation. Here, we use clonal analysis in the developing eye to investigate the effect of lgl null mutations in the context of surrounding wild-type tissue. lgl- clones in the larval eye disc exhibit ectopic expression of the G1-S regulator, Cyclin E, and ectopic proliferation, but do not lose apico-basal cell polarity. Decreasing the perdurance of Lgl protein in larval eye disc clones, by forcing extra proliferation of lgl- tissue (using a Minute background), leads to a loss in cell polarity and to more extreme ectopic cell proliferation. Later in development at the pupal stage, lgl mutant photoreceptor cells show aberrant apico-basal cell polarity, but this is not associated with ectopic proliferation, presumably because cells are differentiated. Thus in a clonal context, the ectopic proliferation and cell polarity defects of lgl- mutants are separable. Furthermore, lgl- mosaic eye discs have alterations in the normal patterns of apoptosis: in larval discs some lgl- and wild-type cells at the clonal boundary undergo apoptosis and are excluded from the epithelia, but apoptosis is decreased elsewhere in the disc, and in pupal retinas lgl- tissue shows less apoptosis.",2007,"Nicola A Grzeschik, Helena E Richardson, Julie Secombe, Anthony M Brumby, Nancy Amin"
Adaptive evolution of metabolic pathways in Drosophila,17379620,10.1093/molbev/msm057,"The adaptive significance of enzyme variation has been of central interest in population genetics. Yet, how natural selection operates on enzymes in the larger context of biochemical pathways has not been broadly explored. A basic expectation is that natural selection on metabolic phenotypes will target enzymes that control metabolic flux, but how adaptive variation is distributed among enzymes in metabolic networks is poorly understood. Here, we use population genetic methods to identify enzymes responding to adaptive selection in the pathways of central metabolism in Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans. We report polymorphism and divergence data for 17 genes that encode enzymes of 5 metabolic pathways that converge at glucose-6-phosphate (G6P). Deviations from neutral expectations were observed at five loci. Of the 10 genes that encode the enzymes of glycolysis, only aldolase (Ald) deviated from neutrality. The other 4 genes that were inconsistent with neutral evolution (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase [G6pd]), phosphoglucomutase [Pgm], trehalose-6-phosphate synthetase [Tps1], and glucose-6phosphatase [G6pase] encode G6P branch point enzymes that catalyze reactions at the entry point to the pentose-phosphate, glycogenic, trehalose synthesis, and gluconeogenic pathways. We reconcile these results with population genetics theory and existing arguments on metabolic regulation and propose that the incidence of adaptive selection in this system is related to the distribution of flux control. The data suggest that adaptive evolution of G6P branch point enzymes may have special significance in metabolic adaptation.",2007,"P S Schmidt, D D Duvernell, E Sezgin, L M Matzkin, W F Eanes, J M Flowers, S Kumagai"

Flies that completely lack SinaH are viable and in combination with a mutation in the gene, Ebi, show an extra dorsal central bristle phenotype. I also show that SinaH and Ebi can interact with each other both in vivo and in vitro suggesting that they act in the same physical complex.

Well-known developmental genes are often reused in surprising tissues in the adult, suggesting new functions. The homologs of many human genetic disease loci show selective expression in the Drosophila tissues analogous to the affected human tissues, providing a useful filter for potential candidate genes.

Lifespan modification by glucose and methionine in Drosophila melanogaster fed a chemically defined diet,19424828,10.1007/s11357-006-9018-4,"Experimentally restricting dietary calories, while maintaining adequate dietary nutrient content, extends lifespan in phylogenetically diverse species; thus suggesting the existence of conserved pathways which can modify lifespan in response to energy intake. However, in some cases the impact on longevity may depend on the quality of the energy source. In Drosophila, restriction of dietary yeast yields considerable lifespan extension whereas isocaloric restriction of dietary sugar yields only modest extension, indicating that other diet-responsive pathways can modify lifespan in this species. In rodents, restricting intake of a single amino acid - methionine - extends lifespan. Here we show that dietary methionine can modify lifespan in adult female, non-virgin Oregon-R strain Drosophila fed a chemically defined media. Compared to a diet containing 0.135% methionine and 15% glucose, high dietary methionine (0.405%) shortened maximum lifespan by 2.33% from 86 to 84 days and mean lifespan by 9.55% from 71.7 to 64.9 days. Further restriction of methionine to 0.045% did not extend maximum lifespan and shortened mean lifespan by 1.95% from 71.1 to 70.3 days. Restricting glucose from 15% to 5% while holding methionine at a concentration of 0.135%, modestly extended maximum lifespan by 5.8% from 86 to 91 days, without extending mean lifespan. All these diet-induced changes were highly significant (log-rank p < 0.0001). Notably, all four diets resulted in considerably longer life spans than those typically reported for flies fed conventional yeast and sugar based diets. Such defined diets can be used to identify lifespan-modifying pathways and specific gene-nutrient interactions in Drosophila.",2007,"Aron M Troen, Emily E French, Jessica F Roberts, Chao-Qiang Lai, Jacob Selhub, Laurence D Parnell, Jose M Ordovas"
Domain mapping on the human metastasis regulator protein h-Prune reveals a C-terminal dimerization domain,17655525,10.1042/BJ20070408,"The human orthologue of the Drosophila prune protein (h-Prune) is an interaction partner and regulator of the metastasis suppressor protein NM23-H1 (non-metastatic protein 23). Studies on a cellular breast-cancer model showed that inhibition of the cAMP-specific PDE (phosphodiesterase) activity of h-Prune lowered the incidence of metastasis formation, suggesting that inhibition of h-Prune could be a therapeutic approach towards metastatic tumours. H-Prune shows no sequence similarity with known mammalian PDEs, but instead appears to belong to the DHH (Asp-His-His) superfamily of phosphoesterases. In order to investigate the structure and molecular function of h-Prune, we expressed recombinant h-Prune in a bacterial system. Through sequence analysis and limited proteolysis, we identified domain boundaries and a potential coiled-coil region in a C-terminal cortexillin homology domain. We found that this C-terminal domain mediated h-Prune homodimerization, as well as its interaction with NM23-H1. The PDE catalytic domain of h-Prune was mapped to the N-terminus and shown to be active, even when present in a monomeric form. Our findings indicate that h-Prune is composed of two independent active sites and two interaction sites for the assembly of oligomeric signalling complexes.",2007,"Clemens Steegborn, Massimo Zollo, Sabine Middelhaufe, Livia Garzia, Uta-Maria Ohndorf, Barbara Kachholz"
"Three microtubule severing enzymes contribute to the ""Pacman-flux"" machinery that moves chromosomes",17452528,10.1083/jcb.200612011,"Chromosomes move toward mitotic spindle poles by a Pacman-flux mechanism linked to microtubule depolymerization: chromosomes actively depolymerize attached microtubule plus ends (Pacman) while being reeled in to spindle poles by the continual poleward flow of tubulin subunits driven by minus-end depolymerization (flux). We report that Pacman-flux in Drosophila melanogaster incorporates the activities of three different microtubule severing enzymes, Spastin, Fidgetin, and Katanin. Spastin and Fidgetin are utilized to stimulate microtubule minus-end depolymerization and flux. Both proteins concentrate at centrosomes, where they catalyze the turnover of gamma-tubulin, consistent with the hypothesis that they exert their influence by releasing stabilizing gamma-tubulin ring complexes from minus ends. In contrast, Katanin appears to function primarily on anaphase chromosomes, where it stimulates microtubule plus-end depolymerization and Pacman-based chromatid motility. Collectively, these findings reveal novel and significant roles for microtubule severing within the spindle and broaden our understanding of the molecular machinery used to move chromosomes.",2007,"David J Sharp, Gregory C Rogers, Dong Zhang, Daniel W Buster"
A conserved molecular pathway mediates myoblast fusion in insects and vertebrates,17529975,10.1038/ng2055,"Skeletal muscles arise by fusion of precursor cells, myoblasts, into multinucleated fibers.

Within developing somites, Kirrel expression localized to membranes of fusion-competent myoblasts of the fast-twitch lineage. Unlike wild-type myoblasts that form spatially arrayed syncytial (multinucleated) fast myofibers, those deficient in Kirrel showed a significant reduction in fusion capacity. Inhibition of Rac, a GTPase and the most downstream intracellular transducer of the fusion signal in D. melanogaster, also compromised fast-muscle precursor fusion in zebrafish. However, unlike in D. melanogaster, constitutive Rac activation in zebrafish led to hyperfused giant syncytia, highlighting an entirely new function for this protein in zebrafish for gating the number and polarity of fusion events. These findings uncover a substantial degree of evolutionary conservation in the genetic regulation of myoblast fusion.",2007,"Bhylahalli P Srinivas, Sudipto Roy, Wan Ying Leong, Jennifer Woo"
Drosophila ASPP regulates C-terminal Src kinase activity,18061561,10.1016/j.devcel.2007.11.005,"Src-family kinases (SFKs) control a variety of biological processes, from cell proliferation and differentiation to cytoskeletal rearrangements. Abnormal activation of SFKs has been implicated in a wide variety of cancers and is associated with metastatic behavior (Yeatman, 2004). SFKs are maintained in an inactive state by inhibitory phosphorylation of their C-terminal region by C-terminal Src kinase (Csk). We have identified Drosophila Ankyrin-repeat, SH3-domain, and Proline-rich-region containing Protein (dASPP) as a regulator of Drosophila Csk (dCsk) activity. dASPP is the homolog of the mammalian ASPP proteins, which are known to bind to and stimulate the proapoptotic function of p53. We show that dASPP is a positive regulator of dCsk. First, dASPP loss-of-function strongly enhances the specific phenotypes of dCsk mutants in wing epithelial cells. Second, dASPP interacts physically with dCsk to potentiate the inhibitory phosphorylation of Drosophila Src (dSrc). Our results suggest a role for dASPP in maintaining epithelial integrity through dCsk regulation.",2007,"Nicolas Tapon, Paul F Langton, Birgit L Aerne, Julien Colombani"

GFP reporters detect the activation of the Drosophila JAK/STAT pathway in vivo,17008134,10.1016/j.modgep.2006.08.003,"JAK/STAT signaling is essential for a wide range of developmental processes in Drosophila melanogaster. The mechanism by which the JAK/STAT pathway contributes to these processes has been the subject of recent investigation. However, a reporter that reflects activity of the JAK/STAT pathway in all Drosophila tissues has not yet been developed. By placing a fragment of the Stat92E target gene Socs36E, which contains at least two putative Stat92E binding sites, upstream of GFP, we generated three constructs that can be used to monitor JAK/STAT pathway activity in vivo. These constructs differ by the number of Stat92E binding sites and the stability of GFP. The 2XSTAT92E-GFP and 10XSTAT92E-GFP constructs contain 2 and 10 Stat92E binding sites, respectively, driving expression of enhanced GFP, while 10XSTAT92E-DGFP drives expression of destabilized GFP. We show that these reporters are expressed in the embryo in an overlapping pattern with Stat92E protein and in tissues where JAK/STAT signaling is required. In addition, these reporters accurately reflect JAK/STAT pathway activity at larval stages, as their expression pattern overlaps that of the activating ligand unpaired in imaginal discs. Moreover, the STAT92E-GFP reporters are activated by ectopic JAK/STAT signaling. STAT92E-GFP fluorescence is increased in response to ectopic upd in the larval eye disc and mis-expression of the JAK kinase hopscotch in the adult fat body. Lastly, these reporters are specifically activated by Stat92E, as STAT92E-GFP reporter expression is lost cell-autonomously in stat92E homozygous mutant tissue. In sum, we have generated in vivo GFP reporters that accurately reflect JAK/STAT pathway activation in a variety of tissues.

Generalization of courtship learning in Drosophila is mediated by cis-vaccenyl acetate,17363250,10.1016/j.cub.2007.01.053,"Reproductive behavior in Drosophila has both stereotyped and plastic components that are driven by age- and sex-specific chemical cues. Males who unsuccessfully court virgin females subsequently avoid females that are of the same age as the trainer. In contrast, males trained with mature mated females associate volatile appetitive and aversive pheromonal cues and learn to suppress courtship of all females. Here we show that the volatile aversive pheromone that leads to generalized learning with mated females is (Z)-11-octadecenyl acetate (cis-vaccenyl acetate, cVA). cVA is a major component of the male cuticular hydrocarbon profile, but it is not found on virgin females. During copulation, cVA is transferred to the female in ejaculate along with sperm and peptides that decrease her sexual receptivity. When males sense cVA (either synthetic or from mated female or male extracts) in the context of female pheromone, they develop a generalized suppression of courtship. The effects of cVA on initial courtship of virgin females can be blocked by expression of tetanus toxin in Or65a, but not Or67d neurons, demonstrating that the aversive effects of this pheromone are mediated by a specific class of olfactory neuron. These findings suggest that transfer of cVA to females during mating may be part of the male's strategy to suppress reproduction by competing males.",2007,"Joel D Levine, Carson J Miller, Aki Ejima, Wynand van der Goes van Naters, Christophe Lucas, Leslie C Griffith, Benjamin P C Smith, John R Carlson"
putzig is required for cell proliferation and regulates notch activity in Drosophila,17634285,10.1091/mbc.e07-03-0263,"We have identified the gene putzig (pzg) as a key regulator of cell proliferation and of Notch signaling in Drosophila. pzg encodes a Zn-finger protein that was found earlier within a macromolecular complex, including TATA-binding protein-related factor 2 (TRF2)/DNA replication-related element factor (DREF). This complex is involved in core promoter selection, where DREF functions as a transcriptional activator of replication-related genes. Here, we provide the first in vivo evidence that pzg is required for the expression of cell cycle and replication-related genes, and hence for normal developmental growth. Independent of its role in the TRF2/DREF complex, pzg acts as a positive regulator of Notch signaling that may occur by chromatin activation. Down-regulation of pzg activity inhibits Notch target gene activation, whereas Hedgehog (Hh) signal transduction and growth regulation are unaffected.

Flies without a spindle checkpoint,17417628,10.1038/ncb1570,"Mad2 has a key role in the spindle-assembly checkpoint (SAC) - the mechanism delaying anaphase onset until all chromosomes correctly attach to the spindle. Here, we show that unlike every other reported case of SAC inactivation in metazoans, mad2-null Drosophila are viable and fertile, and their cells almost always divide correctly despite having no SAC and an accelerated 'clock', which is caused by premature degradation of cyclin B. Mitosis in Drosophila does not need the SAC because correct chromosome attachment is achieved very rapidly, before even the cell lacking Mad2 can initiate anaphase. Experimentally reducing spindle-assembly efficiency renders the cells Mad2-dependent. In fact, the robustness of the SAC may generally mask minor mitotic defects of mutations affecting spindle function. The reported lethality of other Drosophila SAC mutations may be explained by their multifunctionality, and thus the 'checkpoint' phenotypes previously ascribed to these mutations should be considered the consequence of eliminating both the checkpoint and a second mitotic function.",2007,"Doruk Emre, Roger E Karess, Eulalie Buffin"

The truncated Sd-RanGAP protein is enzymatically active but mislocalizes to the nucleus where it somehow causes distortion. Here I present data consistent with the idea that wild-type RanGAP, and possibly other loci able to influence the RanGTP gradient, has been caught up in an ancient genetic conflict that predates the SD complex. The legacy of this conflict could include the unexpectedly rapid evolution of nuclear transport-related proteins, the accumulation of chromosomal inversions, the recruitment of gene duplications, and the turnover of repetitive sequences in the centric heterochromatin.",2007,Daven C Presgraves

The transmembrane protein Perdido interacts with Grip and integrins to mediate myotube projection and attachment in the Drosophila embryo,18039972,10.1242/dev.014027,"The molecular mechanisms underlying muscle guidance and formation of myotendinous junctions are poorly understood both in vertebrates and in Drosophila. We have identified a novel gene that is essential for Drosophila embryonic muscles to form proper projections and stable attachments to epidermal tendon cells. Loss-of-function of this gene - which we named perdido (perd)-results in rounded, unattached muscles. perd is expressed prior to myoblast fusion in a subset of muscle founder cells, and it encodes a conserved single-pass transmembrane cell adhesion protein that contains laminin globular extracellular domains and a small intracellular domain with a C-terminal PDZ-binding consensus sequence. Biochemical experiments revealed that the Perd intracellular domain interacts directly with one of the PDZ domains of the Glutamate receptor interacting protein (Grip), another factor required for formation of proper muscle projections. In addition, Perd is necessary to localize Grip to the plasma membrane of developing myofibers. Using a newly developed, whole-embryo RNA interference assay to analyze genetic interactions, perd was shown to interact not only with Grip but also with multiple edematous wings, which encodes one subunit of the alpha PS1-beta PS integrin expressed in tendon cells. These experiments uncovered a previously unrecognized role for the alpha PS1-beta PS integrin in the formation of muscle projections during early stages of myotendinous junction development. We propose that Perd regulates projection of myotube processes toward and subsequent differentiation of the myotendinous junction by priming formation of a protein complex through its intracellular interaction with Grip and its transient engagement with the tendon cell-expressed laminin-binding alpha PS1-beta PS integrin.",2007,"Alan M Michelson, Stephen S Gisselbrecht, Beatriz Estrada"
Unfolded protein response in a Drosophila model for retinal degeneration,17170705,10.1038/sj.emboj.7601477,"Stress in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER stress) and its cellular response, the unfolded protein response (UPR), are implicated in a wide variety of diseases, but its significance in many disorders remains to be validated in vivo. Here, we analyzed a branch of the UPR mediated by xbp1 in Drosophila to establish its role in neurodegenerative diseases. The Drosophila xbp1 mRNA undergoes ire-1-mediated unconventional splicing in response to ER stress, and this property was used to develop a specific UPR marker, xbp1-EGFP, in which EGFP is expressed in frame only after ER stress. xbp1-EGFP responds specifically to ER stress, but not to proteins that form cytoplasmic aggregates. The ire-1/xbp1 pathway regulates heat shock cognate protein 3 (hsc3), an ER chaperone. xbp1 splicing and hsc3 induction occur in the retina of ninaE(G69D)-/+, a Drosophila model for autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (ADRP), and reduction of xbp1 gene dosage accelerates retinal degeneration of these animals.

The dynamics of the roo transposable element in mutation-accumulation lines and segregating populations of Drosophila melanogaster,17890368,10.1534/genetics.107.076174,"We estimated the number of copies for the long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposable element roo in a set of long-standing Drosophila melanogaster mutation-accumulation full-sib lines and in two large laboratory populations maintained with effective population size approximately 500, all of them derived from the same isogenic origin. Estimates were based on real-time quantitative PCR and in situ hybridization. Considering previous estimates of roo copy numbers obtained at earlier stages of the experiment, the results imply a strong acceleration of the insertion rate in the accumulation lines. The detected acceleration is consistent with a model where only one (maybe a few) of the approximately 70 roo copies in the ancestral isogenic genome was active and each active copy caused new insertions with a relatively high rate ( approximately 10(-2)), with new inserts being active copies themselves. In the two laboratory populations, however, a stabilized copy number or no accelerated insertion was found. Our estimate of the average deleterious viability effects per accumulated insert [E(s) < 0.003] is too small to account for the latter finding, and we discuss the mechanisms that could contain copy number.",2007,"Montserrat Aguadé, Victoria Avila, Montserrat Papaceit, Aurora García-Dorado"
Study of tauopathies by comparing Drosophila and human tau in Drosophila,17406902,10.1007/s00441-007-0401-y,"The microtubule-binding protein tau has been investigated for its contribution to various neurodegenerative disorders. However, the findings from transgenic studies, using the same tau transgene, vary widely among different laboratories. Here, we have investigated the potential mechanisms underlying tauopathies by comparing Drosophila (d-tau) and human (h-tau) tau in a Drosophila model. Overexpression of a single copy of either tau isoform in the retina results in a similar rough eye phenotype. However, co-expression of Par-1 with d-tau leads to lethality, whereas co-expression of Par-1 with h-tau has little effect on the rough eye phenotype. We have found analogous results by comparing larval proteomes. Through genetic screening and proteomic analysis, we have identified some important potential modifiers and tau-associated proteins. These results suggest that the two tau genes differ significantly. This comparison between species-specific isoforms may help to clarify whether the homologous tau genes are conserved.",2007,"Dawei Cao, Yan Li, Huimin Lu, Weijie Liu, Aike Guo, Xinping Chen, Guoying Yang, Junbo Huang"
Drosophila deoxyribonucleoside kinase mutants with enhanced ability to phosphorylate purine analogs,17581598,10.1038/sj.gt.3302982,"Transduced deoxyribonucleoside kinases (dNK) can be used to kill recipient cells in combination with nucleoside prodrugs. The Drosophila melanogaster multisubstrate dNK (Dm-dNK) displays a superior turnover rate and has a great plasticity regarding its substrates. We used directed evolution to create Dm-dNK mutants with increased specificity for several nucleoside analogs (NAs) used as anticancer or antiviral drugs. Four mutants were characterized for the ability to sensitize Escherichia coli toward analogs and for their substrate specificity and kinetic parameters. The mutants had a reduced ability to phosphorylate pyrimidines, while the ability to phosphorylate purine analogs was relatively similar to the wild-type enzyme. We selected two mutants, for expression in the osteosarcoma 143B, the glioblastoma U-87M-G and the breast cancer MCF7 cell lines. The sensitivities of the transduced cell lines in the presence of the NAs fludarabine (F-AraA), cladribine (CdA), vidarabine and cytarabine were compared to the parental cell lines. The sensitivity of 143B cells was increased by 470-fold in the presence of CdA and of U-87M-G cells by 435-fold in the presence of F-AraA. We also show that a choice of the selection and screening system plays a crucial role when optimizing suicide genes by directed evolution.",2007,"M Willer, L Hasholt, E Rozpedowska, B Munch-Petersen, W Knecht, T Joergensen, C Le Breton, Z Gojkovic, M P B Sandrini, J Piskur"
[Locomotion research with zebrafish],17633524,,"Recent genetic analysis of behavior was successfully performed in C. elegans and Drosophila. However, since the organization and morphology of their nervous system is different from those of vertebrates, it is unclear how applicable these findings are for vertebrates. Additionally, electrophysiological analysis is difficult in these invertebrates. On the other hand, electrophysiology is well established in vertebrate animals, such as mice and Xenopus, but large-scale mutagenesis is costly and difficult with these vertebrates. I started a genetic analysis of behavior in zebrafish to overcome these difficulties. First, zebrafish can be studied using large-scale mutagenesis. Second, electrophysiological methods are available to analyze the CNS, NMJ and muscles in zebrafish. Third, the early behaviors are simple and stereotyped in zebrafish embryos. Fourth, zebrafish embryos are transparent making it possible to visualize dynamic events in vivo such as Ca transients and axon outgrowth. These advantages make the zebrafish an ideal research tool for functional development of neurons and muscles. I characterized accordion and bandoneon mutants, which were defective in calcium pump in muscle and glycine receptor in the CNS, respectively. Interestingly, both of these mutants exhibited similar simultaneous bilateral muscle contraction and shortening of the tail in response to touch.",2007,Hiromi Hirata
"Interactions between the evolutionarily conserved, actin-related protein, Arp11, actin, and Arp1",12857853,10.1091/mbc.e03-01-0049,"The dynein activator dynactin is a multiprotein complex with distinct microtubule- and cargo-binding domains. The cargo-binding domain contains a short, actin-like filament of the actin-related protein Arp1, a second actin-related protein, Arp11, and conventional actin. The length of this filament is invariant in dynactin isolated from multiple species and tissues, suggesting that activities that regulate Arp1 polymerization are important for dynactin assembly. Arp11 is present in a protein complex localized at the pointed end of the Arp1 minifilament, whereas actin capping protein (CapZ) is present at the barbed end. Either might cooperate with conventional actin to cap Arp1. We tested the ability of Arp11 to interact with conventional actin and found it could coassemble. Like Arp1, cytosolic Arp11 is found only in dynactin, suggesting that Arp11 and free cytosolic actin do not interact significantly. Recombinant Arp11 and Arp1 were demonstrated to interact by coprecipitation. We developed an in vivo assay for Arp11-Arp1 interaction based on previous observations that Arp1 forms filamentous assemblies when overexpressed in cultured cells. Arp11 significantly decreases the formation of these organized Arp1 assemblies. Finally, this assay was used to confirm the identity of a putative Arp11 homolog in Drosophila melanogaster.",2003,"Trina A Schroer, D Mark Eckley"
Sp1 and Sp3 are involved in up-regulation of human deoxyribonuclease II transcription during differentiation of HL-60 cells,12694199,10.1046/j.1432-1033.2003.03551.x,"Expression of DNase II in macrophages is potentially crucially important in the removal of unwanted DNA. We have previously shown that DNase II expression is up-regulated at the transcriptional level during the phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA)-induced differentiation of HL-60 and THP-1 cells. In this study, we investigated the cis-regulatory elements and transcription factors involved in this process in HL-60 cells. cis-Regulatory elements in the DNase II promoter were located by 5' deletion and site-directed mutagenesis of promoter-luciferase constructs and transient transfection of HL-60 cells. Furthermore, the binding proteins were identified by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) in the presence of specific antibodies. In the DNase II promoter, 249 base pairs upstream of the transcription start site were essential for maximal promoter activity in both untreated and PMA-treated HL-60 cells and, within this region, three Sp1 and Sp3 binding sites were identified as essential for transcriptional regulation and PMA induction. Western blot analysis showed that PMA treatment resulted in increased levels of Sp1 and Sp3 proteins. Furthermore, cotransfection analysis in Drosophila SL2 cells showed that Sp1 was more potent than Sp3 in activating the DNase II promoter. We therefore conclude that Sp1 and/or Sp3 are involved in the up-regulation of DNase II expression during the differentiation of HL-60 cells.",2003,"Hui-Ling Chen, Shao-Chun Lu, San-Fang Chou"
Phylogenetic analyses alone are insufficient to determine whether genome duplication(s) occurred during early vertebrate evolution,14508816,10.1002/jez.b.40,"The widely accepted notion that two whole-genome duplications occurred during early vertebrate evolution (the 2R hypothesis) stems from the fact that vertebrates often possess several genes corresponding to a single invertebrate homolog. However the number of genes predicted by the Human Genome Project is less than twice as many as in the Drosophila melanogaster or Caenorhabditis elegans genomes. This ratio could be explained by two rounds of genome duplication followed by extensive gene loss, by a single genome duplication, by sequential local duplications, or by a combination of any of the above. The traditional method used to distinguish between these possibilities is to reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships of vertebrate genes to their invertebrate orthologs; ratios of invertebrate-to-vertebrate counterparts are then used to infer the number of gene duplication events. The lancelet, amphioxus, is the closest living invertebrate relative of the vertebrates, and unlike protostomes such as flies or nematodes, is therefore the most appropriate outgroup for understanding the genomic composition of the last common ancestor of all vertebrates. We analyzed the relationships of all available amphioxus genes to their vertebrate homologs. In most cases, one to three vertebrate genes are orthologous to each amphioxus gene (median number=2). Clearly this result, and those of previous studies using this approach, cannot distinguish between alternative scenarios of chordate genome expansion. We conclude that phylogenetic analyses alone will never be sufficient to determine whether genome duplication(s) occurred during early chordate evolution, and argue that a ""phylogenomic"" approach, which compares paralogous clusters of linked genes from complete amphioxus and human genome sequences, will be required if the pattern and process of early chordate genome evolution is ever to be reconstructed.",2003,"Navin R Mahadevan, Ilya Ruvinsky, Jeremy J Gibson-Brown, Amy C Horton"
Molecular cloning and identification of 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate transporter,12716889,10.1074/jbc.M302439200,"Nucleotide sulfate, namely 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS), is a universal sulfuryl donor for sulfation. Although a specific PAPS transporter is present in Golgi membrane, no study has reported the corresponding gene. We have identified a novel human gene encoding a PAPS transporter, which we have named PAPST1, and the Drosophila melanogaster ortholog, slalom (sll). The amino acid sequence of PAPST1 (432 amino acids) exhibited 48.1% identity with SLL (465 amino acids), and hydropathy analysis predicted the two to be type III transmembrane proteins. The transient expression of PAPST1 in SW480 cells showed a subcellular localization in Golgi membrane. The expression of PAPST1 and SLL in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae significantly increased the transport of PAPS into the Golgi membrane fraction. In human tissues, PAPST1 is highly expressed in the placenta and pancreas and present at lower levels in the colon and heart. An RNA interference fly of sll produced with a GAL4-UAS system revealed that the PAPS transporter is essential for viability. It is well known that mutations of some genes related to PAPS synthesis are responsible for human inherited disorders.

Species-specific effects of single sensillum ablation on mating position in Drosophila,12878676,10.1242/jeb.00522,"Dipteran insects show a wide range of species-specific mating positions. Interspecific transitions from one position to another may reflect sexual or natural selection, or be pleiotropic consequences of other genetic changes. Like many cyclorrhaphan flies, Drosophila species mate with the male on the back of the female, positioned centrally. Mechanosensory sensilla on the male genitalia of three species of the melanogaster species sub-group of Drosophila have species-specific effects on mating position and on courtship success: ablation of a single pair of bristles on the genital claspers of D. melanogaster males halved homotypic mating success, and unilateral ablation produced a contralateral asymmetry in the male's mating posture. Ablation of mechanoreceptors on the male genital lateral plate affected mating posture less radically and had no effect on mating frequency. Surprisingly, ablation of sensilla on the claspers of D. simulans and D. sechellia males showed no effect on homotypic mating. A similar result was found for D. melanogaster x D. simulans hybrid males. The existence of major differences in the sensory bases of mating position and copulation success in closely related species shows how differing mating positions may have evolved and underlines the need for detailed functional studies in studying the evolution of insect genitalia: homologous structures may serve different functions in different species.",2003,"Angel Acebes, Matthew Cobb, Jean-François Ferveur"
Stochastic models for circadian rhythms: effect of molecular noise on periodic and chaotic behaviour,12754937,10.1016/s1631-0691(03)00016-7,"Circadian rhythms are endogenous oscillations that occur with a period close to 24 h in nearly all living organisms. These rhythms originate from the negative autoregulation of gene expression. Deterministic models based on such genetic regulatory processes account for the occurrence of circadian rhythms in constant environmental conditions (e.g., constant darkness), for entrainment of these rhythms by light-dark cycles, and for their phase-shifting by light pulses. When the numbers of protein and mRNA molecules involved in the oscillations are small, as may occur in cellular conditions, it becomes necessary to resort to stochastic simulations to assess the influence of molecular noise on circadian oscillations. We address the effect of molecular noise by considering the stochastic version of a deterministic model previously proposed for circadian oscillations of the PER and TIM proteins and their mRNAs in Drosophila. The model is based on repression of the per and tim genes by a complex between the PER and TIM proteins. Numerical simulations of the stochastic version of the model are performed by means of the Gillespie method. The predictions of the stochastic approach compare well with those of the deterministic model with respect both to sustained oscillations of the limit cycle type and to the influence of the proximity from a bifurcation point beyond which the system evolves to stable steady state. Stochastic simulations indicate that robust circadian oscillations can emerge at the cellular level even when the maximum numbers of mRNA and protein molecules involved in the oscillations are of the order of only a few tens or hundreds. The stochastic model also reproduces the evolution to a strange attractor in conditions where the deterministic PER-TIM model admits chaotic behaviour. The difference between periodic oscillations of the limit cycle type and aperiodic oscillations (i.e. chaos) persists in the presence of molecular noise, as shown by means of Poincaré sections. The progressive obliteration of periodicity observed as the number of molecules decreases can thus be distinguished from the aperiodicity originating from chaotic dynamics. As long as the numbers of molecules involved in the oscillations remain sufficiently large (of the order of a few tens or hundreds, or more), stochastic models therefore provide good agreement with the predictions of the deterministic model for circadian rhythms.",2003,"Didier Gonze, Albert Goldbeter, José Halloy, Jean-Christophe Leloup"
Mitochondrial pathology and apoptotic muscle degeneration in Drosophila parkin mutants,12642658,10.1073/pnas.0737556100,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Several lines of evidence strongly implicate mitochondrial dysfunction as a major causative factor in PD, although the molecular mechanisms responsible for mitochondrial dysfunction are poorly understood. Recently, loss-of-function mutations in the parkin gene, which encodes a ubiquitin-protein ligase, were found to underlie a familial form of PD known as autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism (AR-JP). To gain insight into the molecular mechanism responsible for selective cell death in AR-JP, we have created a Drosophila model of this disorder. Drosophila parkin null mutants exhibit reduced lifespan, locomotor defects, and male sterility. The locomotor defects derive from apoptotic cell death of muscle subsets, whereas the male sterile phenotype derives from a spermatid individualization defect at a late stage of spermatogenesis. Mitochondrial pathology is the earliest manifestation of muscle degeneration and a prominent characteristic of individualizing spermatids in parkin mutants. These results indicate that the tissue-specific phenotypes observed in Drosophila parkin mutants result from mitochondrial dysfunction and raise the possibility that similar mitochondrial impairment triggers the selective cell loss observed in AR-JP.",2003,"Jessica C Greene, Isabella Kuo, Alexander J Whitworth, Laurie A Andrews, Leo J Pallanck, Mel B Feany"

Active sites of thioredoxin reductases: why selenoproteins?,14569031,10.1073/pnas.2134510100,"Selenium, an essential trace element for mammals, is incorporated into a selected class of selenoproteins as selenocysteine. All known isoenzymes of mammalian thioredoxin (Trx) reductases (TrxRs) employ selenium in the C-terminal redox center -Gly-Cys-Sec-Gly-COOH for reduction of Trx and other substrates, whereas the corresponding sequence in Drosophila melanogaster TrxR is -Ser-Cys-Cys-Ser-COOH. Surprisingly, the catalytic competence of these orthologous enzymes is similar, whereas direct Sec-to-Cys substitution of mammalian TrxR, or other selenoenzymes, yields almost inactive enzyme. TrxRs are therefore ideal for studying the biology of selenocysteine by comparative enzymology. Here we show that the serine residues flanking the C-terminal Cys residues of Drosophila TrxRs are responsible for activating the cysteines to match the catalytic efficiency of a selenocysteine-cysteine pair as in mammalian TrxR, obviating the need for selenium. This finding suggests that the occurrence of selenoenzymes, which implies that the organism is selenium-dependent, is not necessarily associated with improved enzyme efficiency. Our data suggest that the selective advantage of selenoenzymes is a broader range of substrates and a broader range of microenvironmental conditions in which enzyme activity is possible.",2003,"Susanne Rauch, Linda Johansson, Charles H Williams Jr, R Heiner Schirmer, Elias S J Arnér, L David Arscott, Holger Bauer, Stephan Gromer, David P Ballou"
Genetic recombination and adaptation to fluctuating environments: selection for geotaxis in Drosophila melanogaster,12815456,10.1038/sj.hdy.6800283,"Heritable variation in fitness is the fuel of adaptive evolution, and sex can generate new adaptive combinations of alleles. If the generation of beneficial combinations drives the evolution of recombination, then the level of recombination should result in changes in the response to selection. Three types of lines of Drosophila melanogaster varying in their level of genetic recombination were selected over 38 generations for geotaxis. The within-chromosome recombination level of these lines was controlled for 60% of the genome: chromosome X and chromosome II. The full recombination lines had normal, unmanipulated levels of recombination on these two chromosomes. Conversely, nonrecombination lines had recombination effectively eliminated within the X and second chromosomes. Finally, partial recombination lines had the effective rate of within-chromosome recombination lowered to 10% of natural levels for these two chromosomes. The rate of response to selection was measured for continuous negative geotaxis and for a fluctuating environment (alternating selection for negative and positive geotaxis). All selected Drosophila lines responded to selection and approximately 36% of the response to selection was because of the X and second chromosomes. However, recombination did not accelerate adaptation during either directional or fluctuating selection for geotaxis.",2003,"M C Whitlock, M Mattice, J Gair, D Bourguet"
Inversion polymorphisms and natural selection in Trimerotropis pallidipennis (Orthoptera),14641476,10.1111/j.1601-5223.2003.01716.x,"Grasshoppers have been much less studied than Drosophila when it comes to inversion polymorphisms, despite the occurrence of this rearrangement in several species of grasshoppers. In the present study, 354 males from a natural population of the New World species Trimerotropis pallidipennis, polymorphic for 6 pericentric inversions in 4 chromosome pairs, were sampled at the beginning and at the end of the adult life span. This sampling, along with the fact that generations in this grasshopper are annual and discrete, was done to detect differential adult male longevity among karyotypes and departures from formal null models, such as gametic phase equilibrium. These methods allow the detection of natural selection taking place in the wild. The comparison between age classes showed that some inversions were significantly more frequent in one sample, thus revealing the operation of natural selection. Gametic phase disequilibrium was detected in the sample of aged males but not in the sample of young ones. Furthermore, here we aim to detect the phenotypic targets of longevity selection by examining morphometric characters, in order to have a clearer idea of the relation between inversions and natural selection in this species.

GABA receptors containing Rdl subunits mediate fast inhibitory synaptic transmission in Drosophila neurons,12805302,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.23-11-04625.2003,"GABAergic inhibition in Drosophila, as in other insects and mammals, is important for regulation of activity in the CNS. However, the functional properties of synaptic GABA receptors in Drosophila have not been described. Here, we report that spontaneous GABAergic postsynaptic currents (sPSCs) in cultured embryonic Drosophila neurons are mediated by picrotoxin-sensitive chloride-conducting receptors. A rapid increase in spontaneous firing in response to bath application of picrotoxin demonstrates that these GABA receptors mediate inhibition in the neuronal networks formed in culture. Many of the spontaneous GABAergic synaptic currents are sodium action potential independent [miniature IPSCs (mIPSCs)] but are regulated by external calcium levels. The large variation in mIPSC frequency, amplitude, and kinetics properties between neurons suggests heterogeneity in GABA receptor number, location, and/or subtype. A decrease in the mean mIPSC decay time constant between 2 and 5 d, in the absence of a correlated change in rise time, demonstrates that the functional properties of the synaptic GABA receptors are regulated during maturation in vitro. Finally, neurons from the GABA receptor subunit mutant Rdl exhibit reduced sensitivity to picrotoxin blockade of the mIPSCs and resistance to picrotoxin-induced increases in spontaneous firing frequency. This demonstrates that Rdl containing GABA receptors play a direct role in mediating synaptic inhibition in Drosophila neural circuits formed in culture.",2003,"Hailing Su, Diane K O'Dowd, Daewoo Lee"
Processing of Mgm1 by the rhomboid-type protease Pcp1 is required for maintenance of mitochondrial morphology and of mitochondrial DNA,12707284,10.1074/jbc.M211311200,"The structure of mitochondria is highly dynamic and depends on the balance of fusion and fission processes. Deletion of the mitochondrial dynamin-like protein Mgm1 in yeast leads to extensive fragmentation of mitochondria and loss of mitochondrial DNA. Mgm1 and its human ortholog OPA1, associated with optic atrophy type I in humans, were proposed to be involved in fission or fusion of mitochondria or, alternatively, in remodeling of the mitochondrial inner membrane and cristae formation (Wong, E.

Mgm1 and its orthologs exist in two forms of different lengths. To obtain new insights into their biogenesis and function, we have characterized these isoforms. The large isoform (l-Mgm1) contains an N-terminal putative transmembrane segment that is absent in the short isoform (s-Mgm1). The large isoform is an integral inner membrane protein facing the intermembrane space. Furthermore, the conversion of l-Mgm1 into s-Mgm1 was found to be dependent on Pcp1 (Mdm37/YGR101w) a recently identified component essential for wild type mitochondrial morphology. Pcp1 is a homolog of Rhomboid, a serine protease known to be involved in intercellular signaling in Drosophila melanogaster, suggesting a function of Pcp1 in the proteolytic maturation process of Mgm1. Expression of s-Mgm1 can partially complement the Deltapcp1 phenotype. Expression of both isoforms but not of either isoform alone was able to partially complement the Deltamgm1 phenotype. Therefore, processing of l-Mgm1 by Pcp1 and the presence of both isoforms of Mgm1 appear crucial for wild type mitochondrial morphology and maintenance of mitochondrial DNA.",2003,"Walter Neupert, Mark Herlan, Frank Vogel, Andreas S Reichert, Carsten Bornhovd"
EDL/MAE regulates EGF-mediated induction by antagonizing Ets transcription factor Pointed,12874129,10.1242/dev.00624,"Inductive patterning mechanisms often use negative regulators to coordinate the effects and efficiency of induction. During Spitz EGF-mediated neuronal induction in the Drosophila compound eye and chordotonal organs, Spitz causes activation of Ras signaling in the induced cells, resulting in the activation of Ets transcription factor Pointed P2. We describe developmental roles of a novel negative regulator of Ras signaling, EDL/MAE, a protein with an Ets-specific Pointed domain but not an ETS DNA-binding domain. The loss of EDL/MAE function results in reduced number of photoreceptor neurons and chordotonal organs, suggesting a positive role in the induction by Spitz EGF. However, EDL/MAE functions as an antagonist of Pointed P2, by binding to its Pointed domain and abolishing its transcriptional activation function. Furthermore, edl/mae appears to be specifically expressed in cells with inducing ability. This suggests that inducing cells, which can respond to Spitz they themselves produce, must somehow prevent activation of Pointed P2. Indeed hyperactivation of Pointed P2 in inducing cells interferes with their inducing ability, resulting in the reduction in inducing ability. We propose that EDL/MAE blocks autocrine activation of Pointed P2 so that inducing cells remain induction-competent. Inhibition of inducing ability by Pointed probably represents a novel negative feedback system that can prevent uncontrolled spread of induction of similar cell fates.",2003,"Masataka Okabe, Takuma Yamada, Yasushi Hiromi"

Surprisingly, Cup is also required to repress the translation of oskar. Furthermore, eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) is localized within the oocyte in a cup-dependent manner and binds directly to Cup in vitro.

Ectopic expression of the Suppressor of Underreplication gene inhibits endocycles but not the mitotic cell cycle in Drosophila melanogaster,14508681,10.1007/s00438-003-0924-1,"The Suppressor of Underreplication ( SuUR) gene contributes to the regulation of DNA replication in regions of intercalary heterochromatin in salivary gland polytene chromosomes. In the SuUR mutant these regions complete replication earlier than in wild type and, as a consequence, undergo full polytenization. Here we describe the effects of ectopic expression of SuUR using the GAL4-UAS system. We demonstrate that ectopically expressed SuUR exerts qualitatively distinct influences on polyploid and diploid tissues. Ectopic expression of SuUR inhibits DNA replication in polytene salivary gland nuclei, and reduces the degree of amplification of chorion protein genes that occurs in the follicle cell lineage. Effects caused by ectopic SuUR in diploid tissues vary considerably; there is no obvious effect on eye formation, but apoptosis is observed in the wing disc, and wing shape is distorted. The effect of ectopic SuUR expression is enhanced by mutations in the genes E2F and mus209 ( PCNA). Differential responses of polyploid and diploid cells to ectopic SuUR may reflect differences in the mechanisms underlying mitotic cell cycles and endocycles.",2003,"A A Yurlova, I F Zhimulev, T D Kolesnikova, I V Makunin, E I Volkova"
Strand compositional asymmetries of nuclear DNA in eukaryotes,14629042,10.1007/s00239-003-2483-9,"Both DNA replication and transcription are structurally asymmetric processes. An asymmetric nucleotide substitution pattern has been observed between the leading and the lagging strand, and between the coding and the noncoding strand, in eubacterial, viral, and organelle genomes. Similar studies in eukaryotes have been rare, because the origins of replication in nuclear genomes are mostly unknown and the replicons are much shorter than those of prokaryotes. To circumvent these predicaments, all possible pairs of neighboring genes that are located on different strands of nuclear DNA were selected from the complete genomes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Plasmodium falciparum, Encephalitozoon cuniculi, Arabidopsis thaliana, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, Anopheles gambiae, Mus musculus, and Homo sapiens. For such a pair of genes, one is likely coded from the leading strand and the other from the lagging strand. By examining the introns and the fourfold degenerate sites of codons in the genes of each pair, we found that the relative frequencies of T vs. A and of G vs. C are significantly skewed in most eukaryotes studied. In a gene pair, the potential effects of replication- and transcription-associated mutation bias on strand asymmetry are in the same direction for one gene where leading strand synthesis shares the same template with transcription, while they tend to be canceled out in the other gene. Our study demonstrates that DNA replication-associated and transcription-associated mutation bias and/or selective codon usage bias may affect the strand nucleotide composition asymmetrically in eukaryotic genomes.",2003,"Deng K Niu, Kui Lin, Da-Yong Zhang"
Flock house virus replicates and expresses green fluorescent protein in mosquitoes,12810873,10.1099/vir.0.18938-0,"Flock house virus (FHV) is a non-enveloped, positive-sense RNA virus of insect origin that belongs to the family Nodaviridae. FHV has been shown to overcome the kingdom barrier and to replicate in plants, insects, yeast and mammalian cells. Although of insect origin, FHV has not previously been shown to replicate in mosquitoes. We have tested FHV replication in vitro in C6/36 cells (derived from neonatal Aedes albopictus) and in vivo in four different genera of mosquitoes, Aedes, Culex, Anopheles and Armigeres. FHV replicated to high titres in C6/36 cells that had been subcloned to support maximum growth of FHV. When adult mosquitoes were orally fed or injected with the virus, FHV antigen was detected in various tissues and infectious virus was recovered. Vectors developed from an infectious cDNA clone of a defective-interfering RNA, derived from FHV genomic RNA2, expressed green fluorescent protein in Drosophila cells and adult mosquitoes. This demonstrates the potential of FHV-based vectors for expression of foreign genes in mosquitoes and possibly other insects.",2003,"Lyric C Bartholomay, Bruce M Christensen, Li-Lin Cheng, Ranjit Dasgupta"
Effects of four synthetic musks on the life cycle of the harpacticoid copepod Nitocra spinipes,12657486,10.1016/s0166-445x(02)00159-5,"A full life-cycle (</=26 days exposure) toxicity test with the harpacticoid copepod Nitocra spinipes was used to study the effects of one nitro musk (musk ketone) as well as three polycyclic musks (Tonalide, Celestolide and Galaxolide). A subchronic individual life-table endpoint, the larval development rate, was recorded after 7-8 days exposure of juveniles and was significantly decreased in copepods exposed to sublethal concentrations of musk ketone, Celestolide and Galaxolide. However, none of the Tonalide concentrations had any effect on larval development. The lowest Galaxolide concentration (0.02 mg/l), which affected juvenile development, was about 100 times below the adult 96-h-LC(50)-value of 1.9 mg/l (95% confidence interval: 1.4-2.7 mg/l). However, none of the four musks had any agonistic or antagonistic activity in the ecdysteroid-sensitive Drosophila melanogaster B(II)-cell line. This indicates that the decrease in larval development rate was due to pharmacological effects rather than steroid receptor-mediated endocrine disruption. A modified Euler-Lotka equation was used to calculate a population-level endpoint, the intrinsic rate of natural increase (r(m)), from individual life-table endpoints, i.e. mortality rate, time of release of first brood, sex ratio, the fraction of ovigerous females among all females as well as the number of nauplii per ovigerous female. The second highest musk ketone concentration (0.1 mg/l) was the only treatment, which significantly affected r(m) (***P<0.001). At the highest musk ketone (0.3 mg/l) and Celestolide (0.3 mg/l) concentrations, all copepods were dead at the end of the exposures. This shows that a sensitive individual life-table endpoint is protective over the population-level endpoint r(m). Though we think that it is necessary to obtain population-level endpoints from standardised toxicity test, for ecologically successful risk characterisation of synthetic musks as well as other chemicals. The results from the present study show that it is possible to obtain population-level data from the full life-cycle test with N. spinipes. However, there seems to be little risk that synthetic musks are harmful to copepods at present environmental concentrations.",2003,"Laurence Dinan, Leah Wollenberger, Magnus Breitholtz"

From EST sequence to spider silk spinning: identification and molecular characterisation of Nephila senegalensis major ampullate gland peroxidase NsPox,12535681,10.1016/s0965-1748(02)00207-2,"Spider dragline silk is renowned as one of the toughest materials of its kind. In nature, spider silks are spun out of aqueous solutions under environmental conditions. This is in contrast to production of most synthetic fibres, where hazardous solvents, high temperatures and pressure are used. In order to identify some of the chemical processes involved in spider silk spinning, we have produced a collection of cDNA sequences from specific regions of Nephila senegalensis major ampullate gland. We examined in detail the sequence and expression of a putative Nephila senegalensis peroxidase gene (NsPox) from our EST collection. NsPox encodes a protein with similarity to Drosophila melanogaster and Aedes aegypti peroxidases. Northern analysis and in situ localisation experiments revealed that NsPox is expressed in major and minor ampullate glands of the spider where the main components of the dragline silk are produced. We suggest that NsPox plays a role in dragline silk fibre formation and/or processing.",2003,"B S Stanchev, N N Pouchkina, S J McQueen-Mason"
Computational discovery of internal micro-exons,12799353,10.1101/gr.677503,"Very short exons, also known as micro-exons, occur in large numbers in some eukaryotic genomes.

Drosophila mitoferrin is essential for male fertility: evidence for a role of mitochondrial iron metabolism during spermatogenesis,20565922,10.1186/1471-213X-10-68,"Background: Mammals and Drosophila melanogaster share some striking similarities in spermatogenesis. Mitochondria in spermatids undergo dramatic morphological changes and syncytial spermatids are stripped from their cytoplasm and then individually wrapped by single membranes in an individualization process. In mammalian and fruit fly testis, components of the mitochondrial iron metabolism are expressed, but so far their function during spermatogenesis is unknown. Here we investigate the role of Drosophila mitoferrin (dmfrn), which is a mitochondrial carrier protein with an established role in the mitochondrial iron metabolism, during spermatogenesis. Results: We found that P-element insertions into the 5'-untranslated region of the dmfrn gene cause recessive male sterility, which was rescued by a fluorescently tagged transgenic dmfrn genomic construct (dmfrnvenus). Testes of mutant homozygous dmfrnSH115 flies were either small with unorganized content or contained some partially elongated spermatids, or testes were of normal size but lacked mature sperm. Testis squashes indicated that spermatid elongation was defective and electron micrographs showed mitochondrial defects in elongated spermatids and indicated failed individualization. Using a LacZ reporter and the dmfrnvenus transgene, we found that dmfrn expression in testes was highest in spermatids, coinciding with the stages that showed defects in the mutants. Dmfrn-venus protein accumulated in mitochondrial derivatives of spermatids, where it remained until most of it was stripped off during individualization and disposed of in waste bags. Male sterility in flies with the hypomorph alleles dmfrnBG00456 and dmfrnEY01302 over the deletion Df(3R)ED6277 was increased by dietary iron chelation and suppressed by iron supplementation of the food, while male sterility of dmfrnSH115/Df(3R)ED6277 flies was not affected by food iron levels. Conclusions: In this work, we show that mutations in the Drosophila mitoferrin gene result in male sterility caused by developmental defects. From the sensitivity of the hypomorph mutants to low food iron levels we conclude that mitochondrial iron is essential for spermatogenesis. This is the first time that a link between the mitochondrial iron metabolism and spermatogenesis has been shown. Furthermore, due to the similar expression patterns of some mitochondrial iron metabolism genes in Drosophila and mammals, it is likely that our results are applicable for mammals as well.",2010,"Christoph Metzendorf, Maria I Lind"

Neuronal synaptic outputs determine the sexual fate of postsynaptic targets,20399094,10.1016/j.cub.2010.02.064,"Synapses mediate inductive interactions for the proper development of pre- and postsynaptic cells: presynaptic electrical activities and synaptic transmission ensure the organization of postsynaptic structures, whereas neurotrophins produced in postsynaptic cells support the survival and enlargement of presynaptic partners. In Drosophila, a motor nerve has been implicated in the induction of the muscle of Lawrence (MOL), the formation of which is male specific and depends on the neural expression of fruitless (fru), a neural sex-determinant gene. Here we report the identification of a single motoneuron essential for inducing the MOL, which we call the MOL-inducing (Mind) motoneuron. The MOL is restored in fru mutant males, which otherwise lack the MOL, if the fru(+) transgene is selectively expressed in the Mind motoneuron by mosaic analysis with a repressible cell marker. We further demonstrate that synaptic outputs from the Mind motoneuron are indispensable to MOL induction, because the blockage of synaptic transmission by shibire(ts) (shi(ts)) during the critical period in development abolished the MOL formation in males. Our finding that sex-specific neurons instruct sexually dimorphic development of their innervating targets through synaptic interactions points to the novel mechanism whereby the pre- and postsynaptic partners coordinately establish their sexual identity.",2010,"Daisuke Yamamoto, Masayuki Koganezawa, Tetsuya Nojima, Ken-ichi Kimura"
Structure and kinetic investigation of Streptococcus pyogenes family GH38 alpha-mannosidase,20140249,10.1371/journal.pone.0009006,"Background: The enzymatic hydrolysis of alpha-mannosides is catalyzed by glycoside hydrolases (GH), termed alpha-mannosidases. These enzymes are found in different GH sequence-based families. Considerable research has probed the role of higher eukaryotic ""GH38"" alpha-mannosides that play a key role in the modification and diversification of hybrid N-glycans; processes with strong cellular links to cancer and autoimmune disease. The most extensively studied of these enzymes is the Drosophila GH38 alpha-mannosidase II, which has been shown to be a retaining alpha-mannosidase that targets both alpha-1,3 and alpha-1,6 mannosyl linkages, an activity that enables the enzyme to process GlcNAc(Man)(5)(GlcNAc)(2) hybrid N-glycans to GlcNAc(Man)(3)(GlcNAc)(2). Far less well understood is the observation that many bacterial species, predominantly but not exclusively pathogens and symbionts, also possess putative GH38 alpha-mannosidases whose activity and specificity is unknown. Methodology/principal findings: Here we show that the Streptococcus pyogenes (M1 GAS SF370) GH38 enzyme (Spy1604; hereafter SpGH38) is an alpha-mannosidase with specificity for alpha-1,3 mannosidic linkages. The 3D X-ray structure of SpGH38, obtained in native form at 1.9 A resolution and in complex with the inhibitor swainsonine (K(i) 18 microM) at 2.6 A, reveals a canonical GH38 five-domain structure in which the catalytic ""-1"" subsite shows high similarity with the Drosophila enzyme, including the catalytic Zn(2+) ion. In contrast, the ""leaving group"" subsites of SpGH38 display considerable differences to the higher eukaryotic GH38s; features that contribute to their apparent specificity. Conclusions/significance: Although the in vivo function of this streptococcal GH38 alpha-mannosidase remains unknown, it is shown to be an alpha-mannosidase active on N-glycans. SpGH38 lies on an operon that also contains the GH84 hexosaminidase (Spy1600) and an additional putative glycosidase. The activity of SpGH38, together with its genomic context, strongly hints at a function in the degradation of host N- or possibly O-glycans. The absence of any classical signal peptide further suggests that SpGH38 may be intracellular, perhaps functioning in the subsequent degradation of extracellular host glycans following their initial digestion by secreted glycosidases.",2010,"Michael D L Suits, Yanping Zhu, Gideon J Davies, Harry J Gilbert, David L Zechel, Edward J Taylor, Julia Walton"
Post-eclosion odor experience modifies olfactory receptor neuron coding in Drosophila,20448199,10.1073/pnas.1003856107,"Olfactory responses of Drosophila undergo pronounced changes after eclosion. The flies develop attraction to odors to which they are exposed and aversion to other odors. Behavioral adaptation is correlated with changes in the firing pattern of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs). In this article, we present an information-theoretic analysis of the firing pattern of ORNs. Flies reared in a synthetic odorless medium were transferred after eclosion to three different media: (i) a synthetic medium relatively devoid of odor cues, (ii) synthetic medium infused with a single odorant, and (iii) complex cornmeal medium rich in odors. Recordings were made from an identified sensillum (type II), and the Jensen-Shannon divergence (D(JS)) was used to assess quantitatively the differences between ensemble spike responses to different odors. Analysis shows that prolonged exposure to ethyl acetate and several related esters increases sensitivity to these esters but does not improve the ability of the fly to distinguish between them. Flies exposed to cornmeal display varied sensitivity to these odorants and at the same time develop greater capacity to distinguish between odors. Deprivation of odor experience on an odorless synthetic medium leads to a loss of both sensitivity and acuity. Rich olfactory experience thus helps to shape the ORNs response and enhances its discriminative power. The experiments presented here demonstrate an experience-dependent adaptation at the level of the receptor neuron.",2010,"Chun-Fang Wu, Atulya Iyengar, Obaid Siddiqi, Sarit Pati Goswami, Tuhin Subhra Chakraborty"
"Dimensionality of mate choice, sexual isolation, and speciation",20823250,10.1073/pnas.1003537107,"Multiple cues, across multiple sensory modalities, are involved in mate choice in a wide range of animal taxa. This multiplicity leads to the prediction that, in adaptive radiations, sexual isolation results from divergence in multiple dimensions. However, difficulties in directly measuring preferences and detecting multiple effects limit our ability to empirically assess the number of independent traits contributing to mate choice and sexual isolation. We present an approach to estimate the dimensionality of sexual isolation using mating trials across groups of related populations. We analyze nine radiations: seven in fruit flies (Drosophila) and one each in salamanders (Desmognathus) and cichlid fishes (Pseudotropheus). We find strong evidence that multiple latent traits--linear combinations of phenotypic traits and preferences--are responsible for the patterns of sexual isolation in all nine radiations but that dimensionality has a strong upper limit. Just two latent traits are implicated in the majority of cases. Mapping along latent trait axes tests predictions of sexual-selection models and allows correlation with specific phenotypic traits and functional components of mate choice. We find support for the role of stabilizing natural selection on the sexually selected (male) traits. In the cichlids, latent-trait axes incorporate male-coloration patterns and exhibit convergence as well as divergence among populations. In the salamanders, temporal patterning in sensory modalities and male vs. female preferences are reflected in different latent-trait axes.",2010,"Paul A Hohenlohe, Stevan J Arnold"
The meiotic recombination checkpoint suppresses NHK-1 kinase to prevent reorganisation of the oocyte nucleus in Drosophila,21060809,10.1371/journal.pgen.1001179,"The meiotic recombination checkpoint is a signalling pathway that blocks meiotic progression when the repair of DNA breaks formed during recombination is delayed. In comparison to the signalling pathway itself, however, the molecular targets of the checkpoint that control meiotic progression are not well understood in metazoans. In Drosophila, activation of the meiotic checkpoint is known to prevent formation of the karyosome, a meiosis-specific organisation of chromosomes, but the molecular pathway by which this occurs remains to be identified. Here we show that the conserved kinase NHK-1 (Drosophila Vrk-1) is a crucial meiotic regulator controlled by the meiotic checkpoint. An nhk-1 mutation, whilst resulting in karyosome defects, does so independent of meiotic checkpoint activation. Rather, we find unrepaired DNA breaks formed during recombination suppress NHK-1 activity (inferred from the phosphorylation level of one of its substrates) through the meiotic checkpoint. Additionally DNA breaks induced by X-rays in cultured cells also suppress NHK-1 kinase activity. Unrepaired DNA breaks in oocytes also delay other NHK-1 dependent nuclear events, such as synaptonemal complex disassembly and condensin loading onto chromosomes. Therefore we propose that NHK-1 is a crucial regulator of meiosis and that the meiotic checkpoint suppresses NHK-1 activity to prevent oocyte nuclear reorganisation until DNA breaks are repaired.",2010,"C Fiona Cullen, Hiroyuki Ohkura, Manuel Breuer, Takashi Ito, Oscar M Lancaster"

However, female preference is relatively poorly understood, particularly the relative importance of a female's genes, the environment and their interaction on her preference. We investigated preference in a no-choice design using Drosophila melanogaster iso-female lines and find that there are genotype-by-environment interactions for female preference. Whereas the choosiness of some female genotypes differed little across environments, that of others differed greatly, so that the choosiness rank of females in one environment did not necessarily predict their rank in another. Furthermore, the genetic variance underlying preference also varied across environments. These findings have important consequences for the evolution of female preference and the male sexual traits preference targets.",2010,"D J Hosken, C Narraway, J Hunt, N Wedell"

In the multi-objective optimization technique, we compute the associated Pareto fronts. We analyze the cross regulation mechanism between the gap-genes protein pair Hunchback-Knirps and we show that the posterior distribution of Hunchback follow the experimental data if Hunchback is negatively regulated by the Huckebein protein. This approach enables to us predict the posterior localization on the embryo of the protein Huckebein, and to validate with the experimental data the genetic regulatory network responsible for the antero-posterior distribution of the gap-gene protein Hunchback.

HPat provides a link between deadenylation and decapping in metazoa,20404111,10.1083/jcb.200910141,"Decapping of eukaryotic messenger RNAs (mRNAs) occurs after they have undergone deadenylation, but how these processes are coordinated is poorly understood. In this study, we report that Drosophila melanogaster HPat (homologue of Pat1), a conserved decapping activator, interacts with additional decapping factors (e.g., Me31B, the LSm1-7 complex, and the decapping enzyme DCP2) and with components of the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex. Accordingly, HPat triggers deadenylation and decapping when artificially tethered to an mRNA reporter. These activities reside, unexpectedly, in a proline-rich region. However, this region alone cannot restore decapping in cells depleted of endogenous HPat but also requires the middle (Mid) and the very C-terminal domains of HPat. We further show that the Mid and C-terminal domains mediate HPat recruitment to target mRNAs. Our results reveal an unprecedented role for the proline-rich region and the C-terminal domain of metazoan HPat in mRNA decapping and suggest that HPat is a component of the cellular mechanism that couples decapping to deadenylation in vivo.",2010,"Gabrielle Haas, Felix Tritschler, Tadashi Nishihara, Cátia Igreja, Joerg E Braun, Elisa Izaurralde"

Activation of TRP channels by protons and phosphoinositide depletion in Drosophila photoreceptors,20116246,10.1016/j.cub.2009.12.019,"Background: Phototransduction in microvillar photoreceptors is mediated via G protein-coupled phospholipase C (PLC), but how PLC activation leads to the opening of the light-sensitive TRPC channels (TRP and TRPL) remains unresolved. In Drosophila, InsP(3) appears not to be involved, and recent studies have implicated lipid products of PLC activity, e.g., diacylglycerol, its metabolites, or the reduction in PIP(2). The fact that hydrolysis of the phosphodiester bond in PIP(2) by PLC also releases a proton is seldom recognized and has neither been measured in vivo nor implicated previously in a signaling context. Results: Following depletion of PIP(2) and other phosphoinositides by a variety of experimental manipulations, the light-sensitive channels in Drosophila photoreceptors become remarkably sensitive to rapid and reversible activation by the lipophilic protonophore 2-4 dinitrophenol in a pH-dependent manner. We further show that light induces a rapid (<10 ms) acidification originating in the microvilli, which is eliminated in mutants of PLC, and that heterologously expressed TRPL channels are activated by acidification of the cytosolic surface of inside-out patches. Conclusions: Our results indicate that a combination of phosphoinositide depletion and acidification of the membrane/boundary layer is sufficient to activate the light-sensitive channels. Together with the demonstration of light-induced, PLC-dependent acidification, this suggests that excitation in Drosophila photoreceptors may be mediated by PLC's dual action of phosphoinositide depletion and proton release.",2010,"Simon A Hughes, Jiehong Huang, Che-Hsiung Liu, Christof J Schwiening, Roger C Hardie, Marten Postma"

We observed MTs aligning along the P-D axis at the onset of redistribution and a small but significant excess of + ends-distal MTs in the proximal region of the wing. This characteristic alignment and asymmetry of MT growth was controlled by atypical cadherins Dachsous (Ds) and Fat (Ft). Furthermore, the action of Ft was mediated in part by PAR-1.

A lyophilized water extract of murici, used at three different concentrations (25, 50, and 100 mg/mL), was tested to determine if it could reduce damage induced by the antineoplastic compound doxorubicin in somatic cells of Drosophila melanogaster, analyzed by SMART/wing. The frequency of mutant spots in descendants from standard and high bioactivation crosses was significantly reduced by treatment with murici extract. Further studies are needed using other experimental models, to determine if murici has the potential to be employed by cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.",2010,"L P Felício, D M Mendanha, H D Ferreira, D G Pereira, W B Nunes, S Carvalho, E M Silva"
Embryonic multipotent progenitors remodel the Drosophila airways during metamorphosis,20940225,10.1242/dev.056408,"Adult structures in holometabolous insects such as Drosophila are generated by groups of imaginal cells dedicated to the formation of different organs. Imaginal cells are specified in the embryo and remain quiescent until the larval stages, when they proliferate and differentiate to form organs. The Drosophila tracheal system is extensively remodeled during metamorphosis by a small number of airway progenitors. Among these, the spiracular branch tracheoblasts are responsible for the generation of the pupal and adult abdominal airways. To understand the coordination of proliferation and differentiation during organogenesis of tubular organs, we analyzed the remodeling of Drosophila airways during metamorphosis. We show that the embryonic spiracular branch tracheoblasts are multipotent cells that express the homeobox transcription factor Cut, which is necessary for their survival and normal development. They give rise to three distinct cell populations at the end of larval development, which generate the adult tracheal tubes, the spiracle and the epidermis surrounding the spiracle. Our study establishes the series of events that lead to the formation of an adult tubular structure in Drosophila.",2010,"Chrysoula Pitsouli, Norbert Perrimon"
Warts and Yorkie mediate intestinal regeneration by influencing stem cell proliferation,20727758,10.1016/j.cub.2010.07.041,"Homeostasis in the Drosophila midgut is maintained by stem cells [1, 2]. The intestinal epithelium contains two types of differentiated cells that are lost and replenished: enteroendocrine (EE) cells and enterocytes (ECs). Intestinal stem cells (ISCs) are the only cells in the adult midgut that proliferate [3, 4], and ISC divisions give rise to an ISC and an enteroblast (EB), which differentiates into an EC or an EE cell [3-5]. If the midgut epithelium is damaged, then ISC proliferation increases [6-12]. Damaged ECs express secreted ligands (Unpaired proteins) that activate Jak-Stat signaling in ISCs and EBs to promote their proliferation and differentiation [7, 9, 13, 14]. We show that the Hippo pathway components Warts and Yorkie mediate a transition from low- to high-level ISC proliferation to facilitate regeneration. The Hippo pathway regulates growth in diverse organisms and has been linked to cancer [15, 16]. Yorkie is activated in ECs in response to tissue damage or activation of the damage-sensing Jnk pathway. Activation of Yorkie promotes expression of unpaired genes and triggers a nonautonomous increase in ISC proliferation. Our observations uncover a role for Hippo pathway components in regulating stem cell proliferation and intestinal regeneration.",2010,"Kenneth D Irvine, Binnaz Kucuk Staley"
Diversification of muscle types: recent insights from Drosophila,20673829,10.1016/j.yexcr.2010.07.013,"Myogenesis is a highly conserved process ending up by the formation of contracting muscles. In Drosophila embryos, myogenesis gives rise to a segmentally repeated array of thirty distinct fibres, each of which represents an individual muscle. Since Drosophila offers a large range of genetic tools for easily testing gene functions, it has become one of the most studied and consequently best-described model organisms for muscle development. Over the last two decades, the Drosophila model system has enabled major advances in our understanding of how the initially equivalent mesodermal cells become competent for entering myogenic differentiation and how each distinct type of muscle is specified. Here we present an overview of Drosophila muscle development with a special focus on the diversification of muscle types and the genes that control acquisition of distinct muscle properties.",2010,"Vanessa Tixier, Krzysztof Jagla, Laetitia Bataillé"
MSL cis-spreading from roX gene up-regulates the neighboring genes,20654579,10.1016/j.bbrc.2010.07.059,"The male-specific lethal (MSL) complex in Drosophila melanogaster paints the male X chromosome in a manner that is both cis and trans to induce 2-fold hypertranscription of the X chromosome. To characterize the upregulation of gene expression by MSL cis-spreading, we measured the expressional change of neighboring genes by microarray when the genes were bound by MSL complexes that spread from an autosomal roX transgene. Genes within a 200kb region that includes roX transgenes were upregulated concurrently with MSL cis-spreading. Conversely, there was almost no expressional change in genes from other regions. RT-PCR and ChIP analyses confirmed that the approximately 2-fold gene hypertranscription was due to MSL cis-spreading. We also demonstrated that upregulation of the neighboring gene could rescue haplo-insufficient phenotypes of the Minute mutant, such as short bristle, delayed adult eclosion and decreased viability. These results indicate that the hypertranscription by MSL cis-spreading is a general mechanism that occurs in several tissue types. Our molecular and genetic data suggest that cis-spreading of the MSL complex from high-affinity sites including the roX gene results in upregulation of the neighboring genes, which are targets for dosage compensation in the male X chromosome.",2010,"Hyangyee Oh, Yongkyu Park, Seung-Won Park, Yuh-Ru Lin"
Animal cryptochromes mediate magnetoreception by an unconventional photochemical mechanism,20098414,10.1038/nature08719,"Understanding the biophysical basis of animal magnetoreception has been one of the greatest challenges in sensory biology. Recently it was discovered that the light-dependent magnetic sense of Drosophila melanogaster is mediated by the ultraviolet (UV)-A/blue light photoreceptor cryptochrome (Cry). Here we show, using a transgenic approach, that the photoreceptive, Drosophila-like type 1 Cry and the transcriptionally repressive, vertebrate-like type 2 Cry of the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) can both function in the magnetoreception system of Drosophila and require UV-A/blue light (wavelength below 420 nm) to do so. The lack of magnetic responses for both Cry types at wavelengths above 420 nm does not fit the widely held view that tryptophan triad-generated radical pairs mediate the ability of Cry to sense a magnetic field. We bolster this assessment by using a mutant form of Drosophila and monarch type 1 Cry and confirm that the tryptophan triad pathway is not crucial in magnetic transduction. Together, these results suggest that animal Crys mediate light-dependent magnetoreception through an unconventional photochemical mechanism. This work emphasizes the utility of Drosophila transgenesis for elucidating the precise mechanisms of Cry-mediated magnetosensitivity in insects and also in vertebrates such as migrating birds.",2010,"Lauren E Foley, Robert J Gegear, Steven M Reppert, Amy Casselman"
The Flamingo ortholog FMI-1 controls pioneer-dependent navigation of follower axons in C. elegans,20876647,10.1242/dev.054320,"Development of a functional neuronal network during embryogenesis begins with pioneer axons creating a scaffold along which later-outgrowing axons extend. The molecular mechanism used by these follower axons to navigate along pre-existing axons remains poorly understood. We isolated loss-of-function alleles of fmi-1, which caused strong axon navigation defects of pioneer and follower axons in the ventral nerve cord (VNC) of C. elegans. Notably follower axons, which exclusively depend on pioneer axons for correct navigation, frequently separated from the pioneer. fmi-1 is the sole C. elegans ortholog of Drosophila flamingo and vertebrate Celsr genes, and this phenotype defines a new role for this important molecule in follower axon navigation. FMI-1 has a unique and strikingly conserved structure with cadherin and C-terminal G-protein coupled receptor domains and could mediate cell-cell adhesion and signaling functions. We found that follower axon navigation depended on the extracellular but not on the intracellular domain, suggesting that FMI-1 mediates primarily adhesion between pioneer and follower axons. By contrast, pioneer axon navigation required the intracellular domain, suggesting that FMI-1 acts as receptor transducing a signal in this case. Our findings indicate that FMI-1 is a cell-type dependent axon guidance factor with different domain requirements for its different functions in pioneers and followers.",2010,"Harald Hutter, Brian D Ackley, Lianna Wong, Gian Garriga, Andreas Steimel, Elvis Huarcaya Najarro"
Murine models of human acute myeloid leukemia,20306252,10.1007/978-0-387-69259-3_11,"Primary human AML cells can be isolated and studied in vitro, but many experimental questions can only be addressed using in vivo models. In particular, tractable animal models are needed to test novel therapies. The genetic complexity of human AML poses significant challenges for the generation of reliable animal models. The hematopoietic systems of both zebrafish ( Danio rerio) and Drosophila have been well characterized ( reviewed in [5, 31]) . Both organisms are well suited to forward genetics mutagenesis screens. Although this approach has been useful for identification of mutants with hematopoietic phenotypes ( e.g., cloche), the impact on cancer biology and hematopoietic malignancies in particular has been limited. A zebrafish model of acute lymphoblastic leukemia has been generated [37] and Drosophila models have shed light on the biology of epithelial tumors ( reviewed in [60]). Nonetheless, in vivo modeling of human AML relies most heavily on mice. Most cellular, molecular, and developmental features of the hematopoietic system are well conserved across mammalian species. The availability of the human and mouse genome sequences and the capability of manipulating the mouse genome make mice the most valuable model organism for AML research. Mice have additional practical value because they have a short reproductive cycle and are relatively inexpensive to house.",2010,"Timothy A Graubert, Julie M Fortier"
Assessment of mitotic spindle phenotypes in Drosophila S2 cells,20719276,10.1016/S0091-679X(10)97015-5,"The Drosophila S2 cell line is popularly used to study mitosis. In this cell line, multiple genes can be easily and efficiently knocked down by RNA interference (RNAi), and the associated mitotic phenotypes can be assessed with high-resolution microscopy after immunofluorescence or in a living cell. However, compared to untransformed cells in wild-type organisms such as yeasts or worms, mitosis in the S2 cell line is more variable and often looks abnormal even in RNAi-untreated cells. Therefore, in order to judge whether a phenotype is derived from RNAi of the target gene or is simply a variation of control cells, it is critical to prepare proper control samples and perform objective imaging and image analysis. Here, we discuss how bona fide mitotic phenotypes associated with RNAi can be identified, avoiding selecting false positives, in S2 cells.",2010,Gohta Goshima
Functional regulatory divergence of the innate immune system in interspecific Drosophila hybrids,20551040,10.1093/molbev/msq146,"In order to investigate divergence of immune regulation among Drosophila species, we have engaged in a study of innate immune function in F1 hybrids of Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans. If pathways have diverged between the species such that incompatibilities have arisen between interacting components of the immune network, we expect the hybrids to display dysregulation of immune genes. We have quantified gene induction in hybrid and parental flies in response to bacterial infection. These results show that although the hybrids do not suffer widespread immune breakdown, they show significantly different regulation of many immune genes relative to the parents. We examine this divergence in terms of additivity and expression differences among genes, observing distinct patterns of dysregulation among functional groups within the pathways of the innate immune system. The functional groups most sensitive to misexpression in the hybrids are the downstream components of the network, indicative of some propagation of dysregulation throughout the immune pathways. Interestingly, this dysregulation does not appear to associate with phenotypic differences in bacterial load after infection in hybrids, possibly highlighting some robustness of function of the innate immune response to perturbations like hybridization.",2010,"Erin M Hill-Burns, Andrew G Clark"
Stress-activated cap'n'collar transcription factors in aging and human disease,20215646,10.1126/scisignal.3112re3,"Cap'n'collar (Cnc) transcription factors are conserved in metazoans and have important developmental and homeostatic functions. The vertebrate Nrf1, Nrf2, and Nrf3; the Caenorhabditis elegans SKN-1; and the Drosophila CncC comprise a subgroup of Cnc factors that mediate adaptive responses to cellular stress. The most studied stress-activated Cnc factor is Nrf2, which orchestrates the transcriptional response of cells to oxidative stressors and electrophilic xenobiotics. In rodent models, signaling by Nrf2 defends against oxidative stress and aging-associated disorders, such as neurodegeneration, respiratory diseases, and cancer. In humans, polymorphisms that decrease Nrf2 abundance have been associated with various pathologies of the skin, respiratory system, and digestive tract. In addition to preventing disease in rodents and humans, Cnc factors have life-span-extending and anti-aging functions in invertebrates. However, despite the pro-longevity and antioxidant roles of stress-activated Cnc factors, their activity paradoxically declines in aging model organisms and in humans suffering from progressive respiratory disease or neurodegeneration. We review the roles and regulation of stress-activated Cnc factors across species, present all reported instances in which their activity is paradoxically decreased in aging and disease, and discuss the possibility that the pharmacological restoration of Nrf2 signaling may be useful in the prevention and treatment of age-related diseases.",2010,"Gerasimos P Sykiotis, Dirk Bohmann"
The genetic basis for male x female interactions underlying variation in reproductive phenotypes of Drosophila,20876561,10.1534/genetics.110.123174,"In Drosophila, where females mate multiply, sperm competition contributes strongly to fitness variability among males. Males transfer ""Acp"" seminal proteins to females during mating, and these proteins influence the outcome of sperm competition. Because Acps function within the female, male proteins can directly interact with female molecules in a manner that affects reproductive fitness. Here we begin to dissect the genetic architecture of male×female interactions underlying reproductive phenotypes important to sperm competition. By utilizing chromosome extraction lines, we demonstrate that the third and X chromosomes each have large effects on fertility phenotypes, female remating rate, and the sperm competition parameter, P1. Strikingly, the third and X chromosomes harbor genetic variation that gives rise to strong male×female interactions that modulate female remating rate and P1. Encoded on these chromosomes are, respectively, sex peptide (SP) and sex peptide receptor (SPR), the only pair of physically interacting male Acp and female receptor known. We identified several intriguing allelic interactions between SP and SPR. The results of this study begin to elucidate the complex genetic architecture of reproductive and sperm competition phenotypes and have significant implications for the evolution of male and female characters.",2010,"Clement Y Chow, Mariana F Wolfner, Andrew G Clark"

Developmental role for ACF1-containing nucleosome remodellers in chromatin organisation,20843858,10.1242/dev.048405,"The nucleosome remodelling complexes CHRAC and ACF of Drosophila are thought to play global roles in chromatin assembly and nucleosome dynamics. Disruption of the gene encoding the common ACF1 subunit compromises fly viability. Survivors show defects in chromatin assembly and chromatin-mediated gene repression at all developmental stages. We now show that ACF1 expression is under strict developmental control. The expression is strongly diminished during embryonic development and persists at high levels only in undifferentiated cells, including the germ cell precursors and larval neuroblasts. Constitutive expression of ACF1 is lethal. Cell-specific ectopic expression perturbs chromatin organisation and nuclear programmes. By monitoring heterochromatin formation during development, we have found that ACF1-containing factors are involved in the initial establishment of diversified chromatin structures, such as heterochromatin. Altering the levels of ACF1 leads to global and variegated deviations from normal chromatin organisation with pleiotropic defects.",2010,"Sandra Vengadasalam, Mariacristina Chioda, Anton Eberharter, Elisabeth Kremmer, Peter B Becker"
Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 and Trithorax modulate Drosophila longevity and stress resistance,20018689,10.1073/pnas.0907739107,"Polycomb Group (PcG) and Trithorax Group (TrxG) proteins are key epigenetic regulators of global transcription programs. Their antagonistic chromatin-modifying activities modulate the expression of many genes and affect many biological processes. Here we report that heterozygous mutations in two core subunits of Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), the histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27)-specific methyltransferase E(Z) and its partner, the H3 binding protein ESC, increase longevity and reduce adult levels of trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3). Mutations in trithorax (trx), a well known antagonist of Polycomb silencing, elevate the H3K27me3 level of E(z) mutants and suppress their increased longevity. Like many long-lived mutants, E(z) and esc mutants exhibit increased resistance to oxidative stress and starvation, and these phenotypes are also suppressed by trx mutations. This suppression strongly suggests that both the longevity and stress resistance phenotypes of PRC2 mutants are specifically due to their reduced levels of H3K27me3 and the consequent perturbation of Polycomb silencing. Consistent with this, long-lived E(z) mutants exhibit derepression of Abd-B, a well-characterized direct target of Polycomb silencing, and Odc1, a putative direct target implicated in stress resistance. These findings establish a role for PRC2 and TRX in the modulation of organismal longevity and stress resistance and indicate that moderate perturbation of Polycomb silencing can increase longevity.",2010,"Peter J Harte, Rakhee Banerjee, Jacob Moskowitz, Feng Tie, Alex P Siebold, Daniel L Kiss"

Their offspring developed 14 h (4%) faster on the poor food than offspring of well-fed parents. However, they were slightly smaller as adults.

Cross-linking of phospholipid membranes is a conserved property of calcium-sensitive synaptotagmins,18508081,10.1016/j.jmb.2008.01.084,"Synaptotagmins are vesicular proteins implicated in many membrane trafficking events. They are highly conserved in evolution and the mammalian family contains 16 isoforms. We now show that the tandem C2 domains of several calcium-sensitive synaptotagmin isoforms tested, including Drosophila synaptotagmin, rapidly cross-link phospholipid membranes. In contrast to the tandem structure, individual C2 domains failed to trigger membrane cross-linking in several novel assays. Large-scale liposomal aggregation driven by tandem C2 domains in response to calcium was confirmed by the following techniques: turbidity assay, dynamic light-scattering and both confocal and negative stain electron microscopy. Firm cross-linking of membranes was evident from laser trap experiments. High-resolution cryo-electron microscopy revealed that membrane cross-linking by tandem C2 domains results in a constant distance of approximately 9 nm between the apposed membranes.

A major QTL affects temperature sensitive adult lethality and inbreeding depression in life span in Drosophila melanogaster,18957085,10.1186/1471-2148-8-297,"Background: The study of inbreeding depression has major relevance for many disciplines, including conservation genetics and evolutionary biology. Still, the molecular genetic basis of this phenomenon remains poorly characterised, as knowledge on the mechanistic causes of inbreeding depression and the molecular properties of genes that give rise to or modulate its deleterious effects is lacking. These questions warrant the detailed study of genetic loci giving rise to inbreeding depression. However, the complex and polygenic nature of general inbreeding depression makes this a daunting task. Study of inbreeding effects in specific traits, such as age-specific mortality and life span, provide a good starting point, as a limited set of genes is expected to be involved. Results: Here we report on a QTL mapping study on inbreeding related and temperature sensitive lethality in male Drosophila melanogaster. The inbreeding effect was expressed at moderately high temperature, and manifested itself as severe premature mortality in males, but not in females. We used a North Carolina crossing design 3 to estimate average dominance ratio and heritability. We found the genetic basis of the lethal effect to be relatively simple, being due mainly to a single recessive QTL on the left arm of chromosome 2. This locus colocalised with a QTL that conditioned variation in female life span, acting as an overdominant locus for this trait. Male life span was additionally affected by variation at the X-chromosome. Conclusion: This demonstrates that analysis of large conditional lethal effects is a viable strategy for delineating genes which are sensitive to inbreeding depression.",2008,"Cornelis J Vermeulen, Volker Loeschcke, R Bijlsma"
Functional characterization of three G protein-coupled receptors for pigment dispersing factors in Caenorhabditis elegans,18390545,10.1074/jbc.M709060200,"Here, we report the identification, cloning, and functional characterization of three Caenorhabditis elegans G protein-coupled pigment dispersing factor (PDF) receptors, which we designated as Ce_PDFR-1a, -b, and -c. They represent three splice isoforms of the same gene (C13B9.4), which share a high degree of similarity with the Drosophila PDF receptor and are distantly related to the mammalian vasoactive intestinal peptide receptors (VPAC2) and calcitonin receptors. In a reverse pharmacological screen, three bioactive C. elegans neuropeptides, which were recently identified as the Drosophila PDF orthologues, were able to activate these receptors in a dose-dependent manner with nanomolar potency (isoforms a and b). Integrated green fluorescent protein reporter constructs reveal the expression of these PDF receptors in all body wall muscle cells and many head and tail neurons involved in the integration of environmental stimuli and the control of locomotion. Using a custom data analysis system, we demonstrate the involvement of this newly discovered neuropeptide signaling system in the regulation of locomotor behavior. Overexpression of PDF-2 phenocopies the locomotor defects of a PDF-1 null mutant, suggesting that they elicit opposite effects on locomotion through the identified PDF receptors.

Condensin II resolves chromosomal associations to enable anaphase I segregation in Drosophila male meiosis,18927632,10.1371/journal.pgen.1000228,"Several meiotic processes ensure faithful chromosome segregation to create haploid gametes. Errors to any one of these processes can lead to zygotic aneuploidy with the potential for developmental abnormalities. During prophase I of Drosophila male meiosis, each bivalent condenses and becomes sequestered into discrete chromosome territories. Here, we demonstrate that two predicted condensin II subunits, Cap-H2 and Cap-D3, are required to promote territory formation. In mutants of either subunit, territory formation fails and chromatin is dispersed throughout the nucleus. Anaphase I is also abnormal in Cap-H2 mutants as chromatin bridges are found between segregating heterologous and homologous chromosomes. Aneuploid sperm may be generated from these defects as they occur at an elevated frequency and are genotypically consistent with anaphase I segregation defects. We propose that condensin II-mediated prophase I territory formation prevents and/or resolves heterologous chromosomal associations to alleviate their potential interference in anaphase I segregation. Furthermore, condensin II-catalyzed prophase I chromosome condensation may be necessary to resolve associations between paired homologous chromosomes of each bivalent. These persistent chromosome associations likely consist of DNA entanglements, but may be more specific as anaphase I bridging was rescued by mutations in the homolog conjunction factor teflon. We propose that the consequence of condensin II mutations is a failure to resolve heterologous and homologous associations mediated by entangled DNA and/or homolog conjunction factors. Furthermore, persistence of homologous and heterologous interchromosomal associations lead to anaphase I chromatin bridging and the generation of aneuploid gametes.",2008,"Tom A Hartl, Giovanni Bosco, Sarah J Sweeney, Peter J Knepler"

C. elegans Brat homologs regulate PAR protein-dependent polarity and asymmetric cell division,18652816,10.1016/j.ydbio.2008.06.037,"The evolutionary conserved PAR proteins control polarization and asymmetric division in many organisms. Recent work in Caenorhabditis elegans demonstrated that nos-3 and fbf-1/2 can suppress par-2(it5ts) lethality, suggesting that they participate in cell polarity by regulating the function of the anterior PAR-3/PAR-6/PKC-3 proteins. In Drosophila embryos, Nanos and Pumilio are homologous to NOS-3 and FBF-1/2 respectively and control cell polarity by forming a complex with the tumor suppressor Brat to inhibit Hunchback mRNA translation. In this study, we investigated the possibility that Brat could control cell polarity and asymmetric cell division in C. elegans. We found that disrupting four of the five C. elegans Brat homologs (Cebrats) individually results in suppression of par-2(it5ts) lethality, indicating that these genes are involved in embryonic polarity. Two of the Cebrats, ncl-1 and nhl-2, partially restore the localization of PAR proteins at the cortex. While mutations in the four Cebrat genes do not severely impair polarity, they display polarity-associated defects. Surprisingly, these defects are absent from nos-3 mutants. Similarly, while nos-3 controls PAR-6 protein levels, this is not the case for any of the Cebrats. Our results, together with results from Drosophila, indicate that Brat family members function in generating cellular asymmetries and suggest that, in contrast to Drosophila embryos, the C. elegans homologs of Brat and Nanos could participate in embryonic polarity via distinct mechanisms.",2008,"Jean-Claude Labbé, Vincent Hyenne, Marianne Desrosiers"

We detected physical interaction between the C terminus of Dmp53 and the central region of TAF3 both in yeast two hybrid assays and in vitro. Interestingly, DmTAF3 can also interact with human p53, and mammalian TAF3 can bind to both Dmp53 and human p53. This evolutionarily conserved interaction is functionally significant, since elevated TAF3 expression severely and selectively inhibits transcription activation by p53 in human cell lines, and it decreases the level of the p53 protein as well.

A protein kinase C activity localized to neuropeptide Y-like neurons mediates ethanol intoxication in Drosophila melanogaster,18675322,10.1016/j.neuroscience.2008.07.008,"Neuropeptide Y (NPY) regulates acute ethanol sensitivity and voluntary alcohol consumption in rodents.

We have used the fly model to uncover novel genes and molecular pathways important for acute ethanol response. Here we report a critical role of the conserved protein kinase C (PKC) pathway in mediating the intoxicating effect of ethanol. Flies expressing a pseudo-substrate inhibitor of PKC, directed by npf-gal4, displayed decreased ethanol sensitivity. Furthermore, the RNA interference analysis suggests that a calcium-independent PKC isoform (PKC98E, related to mammalian novel PKCs) is largely responsible for the behavioral phenotype.

It has been shown that population size changes alter the ratio of X linked to autosomal (X/A) variation, with population size reductions and recent bottlenecks leading to decreased X/A diversity ratios. Here we use theory and simulation to investigate a separate demographic effect-that of founder events involving multiply mated females-and find that it leads to much stronger reductions in X/A diversity ratios than are produced by simple population size changes. Investigating the potential of this process to account for sharply reduced X-linked diversity in European Drosophila melanogaster, we find that this model yields predictions that are compatible with the empirical data.",2008,"Rasmus Nielsen, John E Pool"
Identification and characterization by electrospray mass spectrometry of endogenous Drosophila sphingadienes,18156591,10.1194/jlr.M700414-JLR200,"Sphingolipids comprise a complex group of lipids concentrated in membrane rafts and whose metabolites function as signaling molecules. Sphingolipids are conserved in Drosophila, in which their tight regulation is required for proper development and tissue integrity. In this study, we identified a new family of Drosophila sphingolipids containing two double bonds in the long chain base (LCB). The lipids were found at low levels in wild-type flies and accumulated markedly in Drosophila Sply mutants, which do not express sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase and are defective in sphingolipid catabolism. To determine the identity of the unknown lipids, purified whole fly lipid extracts were separated on a C18-HPLC column and analyzed using electrospray mass spectrometry. The lipids contain a LCB of either 14 or 16 carbons with conjugated double bonds at C4,6. The Delta(4,6)-sphingadienes were found as free LCBs, as phosphorylated LCBs, and as the sphingoid base in ceramides. The temporal and spatial accumulation of Delta(4,6)-sphingadienes in Sply mutants suggests that these lipids may contribute to the muscle degeneration observed in these flies.",2008,"Van H Phan, Deron R Herr, Julie D Saba, Hoe Sup Byun, Henrik Fyrst, Xinyi Zhang, Robert Bittman, Greg L Harris"
"Interaction of dopamine, female pheromones, locomotion and sex behavior in Drosophila melanogaster",18762189,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2008.08.005,"The regulation of female hydrocarbons and courtship behavior by dopamine and their relationship with locomotion, were investigated in Drosophila melanogaster. Ddc mutants and wild-type female flies treated with tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitors (alpha-methyltyrosine or 3-iodotyrosine) had fewer diene hydrocarbons (female pheromones) and there was a total (Ddc), partial (alpha-methyltyrosine) or no (3-iodotyrosine) rescue of hydrocarbon pattern after dopamine ingestion. There was a correlation between female pheromone level and male courtship intensity for these dopamine-depleted or rescued flies. Female locomotion was decreased in flies treated with tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitors and restored by dopamine, showing that decreased mobility of the female has little importance on male courtship. However, male courtship was inhibited by an increased mobility of dopamine-supplemented females. Tanning, which is altered in dopamine-deficient flies and in tan and ebony mutants, seemed to have no significant influence on female pheromones. Females with increased quantities of dopamine (by ingestion) exhibited larger quantities of pheromones. However, Catsup mutants did not, probably as a result of defects in the epidermis. The Dat mutation, which resulted in more dopamine being produced in the brain, showed no pheromone modification. Together, these data show a complex interaction between dopamine, female hydrocarbons, locomotion and male courtship behavior.",2008,"Mickael Hamann, Claude Wicker-Thomas"
The intergenic spacer of the Drosophila Adh-Adhr dicistronic mRNA stimulates internal translation initiation,18758245,10.4161/rna.5.3.6676,"The eukaryotic ribosome normally cannot be recruited upstream of internal ORFs and therefore polycistronic mRNAs are not efficiently translated in eukaryotic cells.

Here we have investigated the translation mechanism of the dicistronic Adh-Adhr mRNA of Drosophila melanogaster. The data indicate that the full-length intergenic spacer strongly enhances translation of the internal ORF of dicistronic reporters, both in S2 cells and adult flies. Interestingly, transcripts derived from intron-containing constructs gave rise to higher translation yields, suggesting a link between pre-mRNA splicing and efficient internal translation initiation.",2008,"Saverio Brogna, Preethi Ramanathan, Rebekah N Whitehead, Jiannan Guo"
"Biophysical characterization of refolded Drosophila Spätzle, a cystine knot protein, reveals distinct properties of three isoforms",18790733,10.1074/jbc.M801815200,"The Drosophila Spätzle protein, involved in the embryonic development of the dorsal-ventral axis and in the adult immune response, is expressed as a proprotein and is activated by the serine proteinases Easter or Spätzle-processing enzyme. Proteolytic cleavage generates a 106-amino acid COOH-terminal fragment, C106, homologous to the mature form of nerve growth factor NGF, a cystine knot protein. Through alternative splicing, the Spätzle gene encodes for several isoforms that (with one exception, the ""propeptide isoform"") share C106 but differ in the prosequence. Three isoforms have been expressed recombinantly in Escherichia coli strains. The propeptide isoform could be expressed in soluble form and is unstructured according to CD and NMR measurements. Dimeric full-length Spätzle isoforms have been refolded from insoluble inclusion bodies and are able to rescue Spätzle-deficient embryos. Although the two full-length isoforms exhibit similar far-UV CD spectra, large differences in tryptophan fluorescence quenching by the respective pro-parts are observed. Both full-length isoforms exhibited highly cooperative folding transitions. Proteolytic digestion using trypsin resulted in C106, whose unfolding exhibits lower thermodynamic stability and cooperativity compared with the full-length proteins. The structure of C106 reveals a T-shaped dimer with significant differences to NGF and a deep internal cavity. Substantial beta-sheet formation is observed between the two monomers, whereas a long loop containing the single tryptophan residue is disordered in the crystals.

The effect of chemical information on the spatial distribution of fruit flies: I Model results,18780001,10.1007/s11538-008-9327-0,"Animal aggregation is a general phenomenon in ecological systems. Aggregations are generally considered as an evolutionary advantageous state in which members derive the benefits of protection and mate choice, balanced by the costs of limiting resources and competition. In insects, chemical information conveyance plays an important role in finding conspecifics and forming aggregations. In this study, we describe a spatio-temporal simulation model designed to explore and quantify the effects of these infochemicals, i.e., food odors and an aggregation pheromone, on the spatial distribution of a fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) population, where the lower and upper limit of local population size are controlled by an Allee effect and competition. We found that during the spatial expansion and strong growth of the population, the use of infochemicals had a positive effect on population size. The positive effects of reduced mortality at low population numbers outweighed the negative effects of increased mortality due to competition. At low resource densities, attraction toward infochemicals also had a positive effect on population size during recolonization of an area after a local population crash, by decreasing the mortality due to the Allee effect. However, when the whole area was colonized and the population was large, the negative effects of competition on population size were larger than the positive effects of the reduction in mortality due to the Allee effect. The use of infochemicals thus has mainly positive effects on population size and population persistence when the population is small and during the colonization of an area.",2008,"Lia Hemerik, Maarten de Gee, Marjolein E Lof, James Powell, Rampal S Etienne"

MOBKL1A/MOBKL1B phosphorylation by MST1 and MST2 inhibits cell proliferation,18328708,10.1016/j.cub.2008.02.006,"Background: MST1 and MST2 are the mammalian Ste20-related protein kinases most closely related to Drosophila Hippo, a major regulator of cell proliferation and survival during development. Overexpression of MST1 or MST2 in mammalian cells is proapototic; however, little is known concerning the physiologic regulation of the endogenous MST1/MST2 kinases, their role in mammalian cell proliferation, or the identity of the MST1/MST2 substrates critical to proliferative regulation. Results: We show that MST1 and MST2 activity increases during mitosis, especially in nocodazole-arrested mitotic cells, where these kinases exhibit both an increase in both abundance and activation. MST1 and MST2 also can be activated nonphysiologically by okadaic acid or H2O2. The MOBKL1A and MOBKL1B polypeptides, homologs of the Drosophila MATS polypeptide, are identified as preferred MST1/MST2 substrates in vitro and are phosphorylated in cells in an MST1/MST2-dependent manner in mitosis and in response to okadaic acid or H2O2. MST1/MST2-catalyzed MOBKL1A/MOBKL1B phosphorylation alters the ability of MOBKL1A/MOBKL1B to bind and regulate downstream targets such as the NDR-family protein kinases. Thus, MOBKL1A/MOBKL1B phosphorylation in cells promotes MOBKL1A/MOBKL1B binding to the LATS1 kinase and enables H2O2-stimulated LATS1 activation loop phosphorylation. Most importantly, replacement of endogenous MOBKL1A/MOBKL1B by a nonphosphorylatable mutant is sufficient to accelerate cell proliferation substantially by speeding progression through G1/S as well as mitotic exit. Conclusions: These results establish that MST1 and MST2 are activated in mitosis and catalyze the mitotic phosphorylation of MOBKL1A/MOBKL1B. MOBKL1A/MOBKL1B phosphorylation, in turn, is sufficient to inhibit proliferation through actions at several points in the cell cycle.",2008,"Joseph Avruch, Fan Xia, Maria Praskova"
Systemic inactivation of Hs6st1 in mice is associated with late postnatal mortality without major defects in organogenesis,18196599,10.1002/dvg.20355,"Heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans modulate the biological activity of a number of growth factors in development, homeostasis, and cancer. Specific modifications of HS chains by HS biosynthetic enzymes have been implicated in growth factor signaling in multiple aspects of organogenesis.

To address this issue, we generated a conditionally mutant Hs6st1 mouse line and then generated mice with systemic inactivation of Hs6st1. Hs6st1-null pups were viable and grossly normal at birth. The lack of obvious abnormalities in lung, liver, and kidney, which express high levels of Hs6st1 during development, suggests that at least during embryonic life, the loss of Hs6st1 function may be compensated for by mechanisms involving other HS modifying enzymes. During early adulthood, however, Hs6st1-null mice failed to thrive and exhibited growth retardation, body weight loss, enlargement of airspaces in the lung and, in some cases, lethality.

NinaB combines carotenoid oxygenase and retinoid isomerase activity in a single polypeptide,19020100,10.1073/pnas.0807805105,"In animals, successful production of the visual chromophore (11-cis-retinal or derivatives thereof such as 11-cis-3-hydroxy-retinal) is essential for photoreceptor cell function and survival. These carotenoid-derived compounds must combine with a protein moiety (the opsin) to establish functional visual pigments. Evidence from cell culture systems has implicated that the retinal pigment epithelium protein of 65 kDa (RPE65) is the long-sought all-trans to 11-cis retinoid isomerase. RPE65 is structurally related to nonheme iron oxygenases that catalyze the conversion of carotenoids into retinoids. In vertebrate genomes, two carotenoid oxygenases and RPE65 are encoded, whereas in insect genomes only a single representative of this protein family, named NinaB (denoting neither inactivation nor afterpotential mutant B), is encoded. We here cloned and functionally characterized the ninaB gene from the great wax moth Galleria mellonella. We show that the recombinant purified enzyme combines isomerase and oxygenase (isomerooxygenase) activity in a single polypeptide. From kinetics and isomeric composition of cleavage products of asymmetrical carotenoid substrates, we propose a model for the spatial arrangement between substrate and enzyme. In Drosophila, we show that carotenoid-isomerooxygenase activity of NinaB is more generally found in insects, and we provide physiological evidence that carotenoids such as 11-cis-retinal can promote visual pigment biogenesis in the dark.

Evolution of a desaturase involved in female pheromonal cuticular hydrocarbon biosynthesis and courtship behavior in Drosophila,18207084,10.1016/j.ibmb.2007.11.005,"Drosophila species exhibit polymorphism in female pheromonal cuticular hydrocarbons, with 7-monoenes produced in Drosophila simulans and 7,11-dienes in most populations of Drosophila melanogaster (5,9-dienes in several African populations). A female-biased desaturase, desatF, expressed only in D. melanogaster is involved in the synthesis of 7,11-dienes. We investigated the role of desatF in 5,9-diene flies. We constructed a 5,9-diene strain knock-down for desatF and showed that desatF is involved in 5,9-diene formation. We also studied D. melanogaster/D. simulans hybrids. These hybrid females produced dienes and received normal courtship from D. melanogaster males, but copulation success was reduced. With D. simulans males, courtship was decreased and no copulation occurred. Hybrids with a chromosomal deletion of the D. melanogaster desatF gene had no dienes and received normal courtship from D. simulans males; depending on the D. simulans parental strain, 7-19% of them succeeded in mating. D. simulans desatF promoter region shows 21-23% gaps and 86-89% identity with D. melanogaster promoter region, the coding region 93-94% identity, depending on the strain.

The crystal structures of ternary complexes between PHD, HD1, and two different H3K4me peptides reveal a unique mode of histone tail recognition: efficient histone binding requires HD1 association, and the PHD-HD1 complex binds preferentially to H3K4me2 while displaying insensitivity to methylation of H3R2. Therefore, this is a prime example of histone tail binding by a PHD finger (of Pygo) being modulated by a cofactor (BCL9/Legless). Rescue experiments in Drosophila indicate that Wnt signaling outputs depend on histone decoding. The specificity of this process provided by the Pygo-BCL9/Legless complex suggests that this complex facilitates an early step in the transition from gene silence to Wnt-induced transcription.",2008,"Maxim Nekrasov, Vladimir Rybin, Jürg Müller, Juliusz Mieszczanek, Phil Evans, Marc Fiedler, Mariann Bienz, María José Sánchez-Barrena"

JNK signaling controls border cell cluster integrity and collective cell migration,18394890,10.1016/j.cub.2008.03.029,"Collective cell movement is a mechanism for invasion identified in many developmental events. Examples include the movement of lateral-line neurons in Zebrafish, cells in the inner blastocyst, and metastasis of epithelial tumors [1]. One key model to study collective migration is the movement of border cell clusters in Drosophila. Drosophila egg chambers contain 15 nurse cells and a single oocyte surrounded by somatic follicle cells. At their anterior end, polar cells recruit several neighboring follicle cells to form the border cell cluster [2]. By stage 9, and over 6 hr, border cells migrate as a cohort between nurse cells toward the oocyte. The specification and directionality of border cell movement are regulated by hormonal and signaling mechanisms [3]. However, how border cells are held together while they migrate is not known. Here, we show that a negative-feedback loop controlling JNK activity regulates border cell cluster integrity. JNK signaling modulates contacts between border cells and between border cells and substratum to sustain collective migration by regulating several effectors including the polarity factor Bazooka and the cytoskeletal adaptor D-Paxillin. We anticipate a role for the JNK pathway in controlling collective cell movements in other morphogenetic and clinical models.",2008,"Flora Llense, Enrique Martín-Blanco"

The GAL4 System: A Versatile Toolkit for Gene Expression in Drosophila,21356876,10.1101/pdb.top49,"INTRODUCTIONThe generation of gain-of-function phenotypes by ectopic expression of known genes provides a powerful complement to the genetic approach, in which genes are studied or identified through mutations that generally reduce or eliminate gene function. The GAL4 system is a method for ectopic gene expression that allows the selective activation of any cloned gene in a wide variety of tissue- and cell-specific patterns. A key advantage of the system is the separation of the GAL4 protein from its target gene in distinct transgenic lines, which ensures that the target gene is silent until the introduction of GAL4. Recent modifications and adaptations of the GAL4 system to make the system inducible have further expanded its scope, enabling greater temporal control over the activity of GAL4.

Circadian control of membrane excitability in Drosophila melanogaster lateral ventral clock neurons,18562620,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1503-08.2008,"Drosophila circadian rhythms are controlled by a neural circuit containing approximately 150 clock neurons. Although much is known about mechanisms of autonomous cellular oscillation, the connection between cellular oscillation and functional outputs that control physiological and behavioral rhythms is poorly understood. To address this issue, we performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings on lateral ventral clock neurons (LN(v)s), including large (lLN(v)s) and small LN(v)s (sLN(v)s), in situ in adult fly whole-brain explants. We found two distinct sizes of action potentials (APs) in >50% of lLN(v)s that fire APs spontaneously, and determined that large APs originate in the ipsilateral optic lobe and small APs in the contralateral. lLN(v) resting membrane potential (RMP), spontaneous AP firing rate, and membrane resistance are cyclically regulated as a function of time of day in 12 h light/dark conditions (LD). lLN(v) RMP becomes more hyperpolarized as time progresses from dawn to dusk with a concomitant decrease in spontaneous AP firing rate and membrane resistance. From dusk to dawn, lLN(v) RMP becomes more depolarized, with spontaneous AP firing rate and membrane resistance remaining stable. In contrast, circadian defective per(0) null mutant lLN(v) membrane excitability is nearly constant in LD. Over 24 h in constant darkness (DD), wild-type lLN(v) membrane excitability is not cyclically regulated, although RMP gradually becomes slightly more depolarized. sLN(v) RMP is most depolarized around lights-on, with substantial variability centered around lights-off in LD. Our results indicate that LN(v) membrane excitability encodes time of day via a circadian clock-dependent mechanism, and likely plays a critical role in regulating Drosophila circadian behavior.",2008,"Michael N Nitabach, Guan Cao"
Characterization of voltage-dependent Ca2+ currents in identified Drosophila motoneurons in situ,18550721,10.1152/jn.90464.2008,"Voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels contribute to neurotransmitter release, integration of synaptic information, and gene regulation within neurons. Thus understanding where diverse Ca2+ channels are expressed is an important step toward understanding neuronal function within a network. Drosophila provides a useful model for exploring the function of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels in an intact system, but Ca2+ currents within the central processes of Drosophila neurons in situ have not been well described. The aim of this study was to characterize voltage-dependent Ca2+ currents in situ from identified larval motoneurons. Whole cell recordings from the somata of identified motoneurons revealed a significant influence of extracellular Ca2+ on spike shape and firing rate. Using whole cell voltage clamp, along with blockers of Na+ and K+ channels, a Ca2+-dependent inward current was isolated. The Drosophila genome contains three genes with homology to vertebrate voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels: Dmca1A, Dmca1D, and Dmalpha1G. We used mutants of Dmca1A and Dmca1D as well as targeted expression of an RNAi transgene to Dmca1D to determine the genes responsible for the voltage-dependent Ca2+ current recorded from two identified motoneurons. Our results implicate Dmca1D as the major contributor to the voltage-dependent Ca2+ current recorded from the somatodendritic processes of motoneurons, whereas Dmca1A has previously been localized to the presynaptic terminal where it is essential for neurotransmitter release.

The acetate switch of an intestinal pathogen disrupts host insulin signaling and lipid metabolism,25525791,10.1016/j.chom.2014.10.006,"Vibrio cholerae is lethal to the model host Drosophila melanogaster through mechanisms not solely attributable to cholera toxin. To examine additional virulence determinants, we performed a genetic screen in V. cholerae-infected Drosophila and identified the two-component system CrbRS. CrbRS controls transcriptional activation of acetyl-CoA synthase-1 (ACS-1) and thus regulates the acetate switch, in which bacteria transition from excretion to assimilation of environmental acetate. The resultant loss of intestinal acetate leads to deactivation of host insulin signaling and lipid accumulation in enterocytes, resulting in host lethality. These metabolic effects are not observed upon infection with &#916;crbS or &#916;acs1 V. cholerae mutants. Additionally, uninfected flies lacking intestinal commensals, which supply short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) such as acetate, also exhibit altered insulin signaling and intestinal steatosis, which is reversed upon acetate supplementation.

Postsynaptic glutamate receptors regulate local BMP signaling at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction,24353060,10.1242/dev.097758,"Effective communication between pre- and postsynaptic compartments is required for proper synapse development and function. At the Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ), a retrograde BMP signal functions to promote synapse growth, stability and homeostasis and coordinates the growth of synaptic structures. Retrograde BMP signaling triggers accumulation of the pathway effector pMad in motoneuron nuclei and at synaptic termini. Nuclear pMad, in conjunction with transcription factors, modulates the expression of target genes and instructs synaptic growth; a role for synaptic pMad remains to be determined. Here, we report that pMad signals are selectively lost at NMJ synapses with reduced postsynaptic sensitivities. Despite this loss of synaptic pMad, nuclear pMad persisted in motoneuron nuclei, and expression of BMP target genes was unaffected, indicating a specific impairment in pMad production/maintenance at synaptic termini. During development, synaptic pMad accumulation followed the arrival and clustering of ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) at NMJ synapses. Synaptic pMad was lost at NMJ synapses developing at suboptimal levels of iGluRs and Neto, an auxiliary subunit required for functional iGluRs. Genetic manipulations of non-essential iGluR subunits revealed that synaptic pMad signals specifically correlated with the postsynaptic type-A glutamate receptors. Altering type-A receptor activities via protein kinase A (PKA) revealed that synaptic pMad depends on the activity and not the net levels of postsynaptic type-A receptors. Thus, synaptic pMad functions as a local sensor for NMJ synapse activity and has the potential to coordinate synaptic activity with a BMP retrograde signal required for synapse growth and homeostasis.",2014,"Young-Jun Kim, Mihaela Serpe, Mikolaj Sulkowski"

Here, we use in vitro selection strategies and quantitative biochemistry to identify and characterize the consensus NELF-E binding element (NBE) that is required for sequence specific RNA recognition (NBE: CUGAGGA(U) for Drosophila). An NBE-like element is present within the loop region of the transactivation-response element (TAR) of HIV-1 RNA, a known regulatory target of human NELF-E.

We also identify a non-conserved region within the RRM that contributes to the RNA recognition of Drosophila NELF-E. To understand the broader functional relevance of NBEs, we analyzed promoter-proximal regions genome-wide in Drosophila and show that the NBE is enriched +20 to +30 nucleotides downstream of the transcription start site. Consistent with the role of NELF in pausing, we observe a significant increase in NBEs among paused genes compared to non-paused genes. In addition to these observations, SELEX with nuclear run-on RNA enrich for NBE-like sequences. Together, these results describe the RNA binding behavior of NELF-E and supports a biological role for NELF-E in promoter-proximal pausing of both HIV-1 and cellular genes.",2014,"Harold G Craighead, Brian S White, Abdullah Ozer, John M Pagano, Kylan Szeto, David Shalloway, Rebekka O Sprouse, Colin T Waters, Hojoong Kwak, John T Lis"
Optomotor-blind in the development of the Drosophila HS and VS lobula plate tangential cells,24912380,10.3109/01677063.2014.917645,"The horizontal system and vertical system cells of the dipteran optic lobes are well understood regarding their physiology and role in visually guided behavior. Little is known, however, about their development. Drosophila optomotor-blind (omb) is required for the development of the HS/VS cells which are lacking in the adult brain of the In(1)omb[H31] regulatory mutant. We have analyzed the omb regulatory region, required for HS/VS development, for enhancers active in the central nervous system. A 1-kb fragment, ombJb, was identified 114 kb downstream of the omb transcription start site, that could drive expression in much of the presumptive embryonic optic lobe anlage. Expression in these cells is lost in In(1)omb[H31] suggesting that they contain the HS/VS precursor cell(s). We used Laser ablation in the embryonic CNS in order to localize the position of the HS/VS precursor cell(s) in this tissue. An omb-Gal4 enhancer trap line, which showed activity in the optic lobe anlage in a pattern similar to ombJb enhancer, was used to drive GFP expression, thus allowing to focus the Laser beam to the relevant area. We identified a small region in the embryonic brain from which the HS/VS cells are likely to develop. Omb encodes a transcription factor of the T-box family. Since loss of omb disrupts HS/VS cell development, we assume that HS/VS ontogeny is controlled by Omb target genes. As a first step toward their identification, we characterized the Omb DNA-binding specificity.",2014,"Gert O Pflugfelder, Aditya Sen, Kerstin Hofmeyer, Stefan Grimm"
Septins promote F-actin ring formation by crosslinking actin filaments into curved bundles,24633326,10.1038/ncb2921,"Animal cell cytokinesis requires a contractile ring of crosslinked actin filaments and myosin motors. How contractile rings form and are stabilized in dividing cells remains unclear. We address this problem by focusing on septins, highly conserved proteins in eukaryotes whose precise contribution to cytokinesis remains elusive. We use the cleavage of the Drosophila melanogaster embryo as a model system, where contractile actin rings drive constriction of invaginating membranes to produce an epithelium in a manner akin to cell division. In vivo functional studies show that septins are required for generating curved and tightly packed actin filament networks. In vitro reconstitution assays show that septins alone bundle actin filaments into rings, accounting for the defects in actin ring formation in septin mutants. The bundling and bending activities are conserved for human septins, and highlight unique functions of septins in the organization of contractile actomyosin rings.",2014,"Manos Mavrakis, José Alvarado, Feng-Ching Tsai, Yannick Azou-Gros, Aurélie Bertin, Thomas Lecuit, Sophie Brasselet, Francois Iv, Alla Kress, Gijsje H Koenderink"
The expression of CPEB proteins is sequentially regulated during zebrafish oogenesis and embryogenesis,24474627,10.1002/mrd.22306,"In many species, there is little transcription in the mature oocyte, and zygotic transcription does not begin immediately after fertilization. In zebrafish, zygotic transcription is not initiated until the mid-blastula transition, thus the production of new proteins during oogenesis and early embryogenesis is dependent on the translation of maternal mRNAs. In a growing number of species, the translation of key maternal transcripts is coupled to their cytoplasmic polyadenylation. One family of RNA-binding proteins implicated in this process is the cytoplasmic polyadenylation element (CPE)-binding proteins (CPEBs), which bind to a sequence in the 3'-untranslated regions of regulated transcripts and mediate their storage/repression or translation. In several species, there is evidence for two classes of CPEBs, a larger oocyte-type and a smaller CPEB that functions during embryogenesis. This appears to be the case in zebrafish as well, and we now provide evidence suggesting that the oocyte-type CPEB (zorba) regulates the translation of the embryonic-type (ElrA) by keeping the ElrA transcript in storage until fertilization. When zorba levels fall, ElrA protein is then produced and available to regulate the translation of additional mRNAs during embryogenesis. We have also identified a potential target of ElrA, the maternal mRNA for hnRNPab, which is a potential homolog of the Drosophila gene squid, whose product plays a role in patterning the Drosophila oocyte and embryo. These data suggest that during zebrafish embryogenesis, cytoplasmic polyadenylation mediates a cascade of translational control whose final targets play central patterning roles during embryogenesis.",2014,"William C Cavallo Jr, Maytal Firnberg, Marcia L O'Connell"
Mitigating phototoxicity during multiphoton microscopy of live Drosophila embryos in the 1.0-1.2 µm wavelength range,25111506,10.1371/journal.pone.0104250,"Light-induced toxicity is a fundamental bottleneck in microscopic imaging of live embryos. In this article, after a review of photodamage mechanisms in cells and tissues, we assess photo-perturbation under illumination conditions relevant for point-scanning multiphoton imaging of live Drosophila embryos. We use third-harmonic generation (THG) imaging of developmental processes in embryos excited by pulsed near-infrared light in the 1.0-1.2 µm range. We study the influence of imaging rate, wavelength, and pulse duration on the short-term and long-term perturbation of development and define criteria for safe imaging. We show that under illumination conditions typical for multiphoton imaging, photodamage in this system arises through 2- and/or 3-photon absorption processes and in a cumulative manner. Based on this analysis, we derive general guidelines for improving the signal-to-damage ratio in two-photon (2PEF/SHG) or THG imaging by adjusting the pulse duration and/or the imaging rate. Finally, we report label-free time-lapse 3D THG imaging of gastrulating Drosophila embryos with sampling appropriate for the visualisation of morphogenetic movements in wild-type and mutant embryos, and long-term multiharmonic (THG-SHG) imaging of development until hatching.",2014,"Delphine Débarre, Nicolas Olivier, Emmanuel Beaurepaire, Willy Supatto"
"Chibby functions in Xenopus ciliary assembly, embryonic development, and the regulation of gene expression",25220153,10.1016/j.ydbio.2014.09.008,"Wnt signaling and ciliogenesis are core features of embryonic development in a range of metazoans. Chibby (Cby), a basal-body associated protein, regulates β-catenin-mediated Wnt signaling in the mouse but not Drosophila. Here we present an analysis of Cby's embryonic expression and morphant phenotypes in Xenopus laevis. Cby RNA is supplied maternally, negatively regulated by Snail2 but not Twist1, preferentially expressed in the neuroectoderm, and regulates β-catenin-mediated gene expression. Reducing Cby levels reduced the density of multiciliated cells, the number of basal bodies per multiciliated cell, and the numbers of neural tube primary cilia; it also led to abnormal development of the neural crest, central nervous system, and pronephros, all defects that were rescued by a Cby-GFP chimera. Reduction of Cby led to an increase in Wnt8a and decreases in Gli2, Gli3, and Shh RNA levels. Many, but not all, morphant phenotypes were significantly reversed by the Wnt inhibitor SFRP2. These observations extend our understanding of Cby's role in mediating the network of interactions between ciliogenesis, signaling systems and tissue patterning.",2014,"Mark Winey, Domenico Galati, Ying Zhao, Michael W Klymkowsky, Jianli Shi"
Development of olfactory projection neuron dendrites that contribute to wiring specificity of the Drosophila olfactory circuit,24817758,10.1266/ggs.89.17,"The antennal lobe (AL) of Drosophila is the first olfactory processing center in which olfactory input and output are spatially organized into distinct channels via glomeruli to form a discrete neural map. In each glomerulus, the axons of a single type of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) synapse with the dendrites of a single type of projection neurons (PNs). The AL is an ideal place to study how the wiring specificity between specific types of ORNs and PNs is established during development. During the past two decades, the involvement of diverse molecules in the specification and patterning of ORNs and PNs has been reported. Furthermore, local interneurons-another component of glomeruli-have been recently catalogued and their functions have been gradually dissected. Although there is accumulating knowledge about the involvement of these three cell types in the wiring specificity of the olfactory system, in this review, we focus especially on the development of PN dendrites.",2014,"Marie Anzo, Takahiro Chihara, Chisako Sakuma, Masayuki Miura"
Indispensable pre-mitotic endocycles promote aneuploidy in the Drosophila rectum,25142462,10.1242/dev.109850,"The endocycle is a modified cell cycle that lacks M phase. Endocycles are well known for enabling continued growth of post-mitotic tissues. By contrast, we discovered pre-mitotic endocycles in precursors of Drosophila rectal papillae (papillar cells). Unlike all known proliferative Drosophila adult precursors, papillar cells endocycle before dividing. Furthermore, unlike diploid mitotic divisions, these polyploid papillar divisions are frequently error prone, suggesting papillar structures may accumulate long-term aneuploidy. Here, we demonstrate an indispensable requirement for pre-mitotic endocycles during papillar development and also demonstrate that such cycles seed papillar aneuploidy. We find blocking pre-mitotic endocycles disrupts papillar morphogenesis and causes organismal lethality under high-salt dietary stress. We further show that pre-mitotic endocycles differ from post-mitotic endocycles, as we find only the M-phase-capable polyploid cells of the papillae and female germline can retain centrioles. In papillae, this centriole retention contributes to aneuploidy, as centrioles amplify during papillar endocycles, causing multipolar anaphase. Such aneuploidy is well tolerated in papillae, as it does not significantly impair cell viability, organ formation or organ function. Together, our results demonstrate that pre-mitotic endocycles can enable specific organ construction and are a mechanism that promotes highly tolerated aneuploidy.",2014,"Kevin P Schoenfelder, Ashley L Lennox, Ruth A Montague, Donald T Fox, Sarah V Paramore, Anthony P Mahowald"
Multi-unit recording with iridium oxide modified stereotrodes in Drosophila melanogaster,24286699,10.1016/j.jneumeth.2013.11.013,"Background: Drosophila is a very favorable animal model for the studies of neuroscience. However, it remains a great challenge to employ electrophysiological approaches in Drosophila to study the neuronal assembly dynamics in vivo, partially due to the small size of the Drosophila brain. Small and sensitive microelectrodes for multi-unit recordings are greatly desired. New method: We fabricated micro-scale stereotrodes for electrical recordings in Drosophila melanogaster. The stereotrodes were modified with iridium oxide (IrO2) under a highly controllable deposition procedure to improve their electrochemical properties. Electrical recordings were carried out using the IrO2 stereotrodes to detect spontaneous action potentials and LFPs in vivo. Results: The IrO2 electrodes exhibited significantly higher capacitance and lower impedance at 1 kHz. Electrical recording with the IrO2 stereotrodes in vivo demonstrated an average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 7.3 and a significantly improved LFP sensitivity. 5 types of different neurons recorded were clearly separated. Electrophysiological responses to visual and odor stimulation were also detected, respectively. Comparison with existing method(s): The most widely used electrodes for electrical recording in Drosophila are glass microelectrode and sharpened tungsten microelectrode, which are typically used for single-unit recordings. Although tetrode technology has been used to record multi-neuronal activities from Drosophila, the fabricated IrO2 stereotrodes possess smaller geometry size but exhibited comparable recording signal-to noise ration and better sorting quality. Conclusions: The IrO2 stereotrodes are capable to meet the requirements of multi-unit recording and spike sorting, which will be a useful tool for the electrophysiology-based researches especially in Drosophila and other small animals.",2014,"Wei He, Li Liu, Liping Wang, Yuanyuan Zhang, Yan Zhu, Yi Lu, Pengfei Wei, Cheng Zhong"

Previous studies revealed the presence of 12 classes of Wnt genes in protostomes, although lineage specific losses of Wnt genes are common. So far, the gene expression profile of only two complete sets of arthropod Wnt genes has been studied; these are the Wnt genes of the fly Drosophila melanogaster and the beetle Tribolium castaneum. Insects, however, do not represent good models for the understanding of Wnt gene evolution because several Wnt genes have been lost in the lineage leading to the insects, or within the different orders of insects. Comparative gene expression data from non-insect arthropods are rare and restricted to a subset of Wnt genes. This study aims to fill this gap and describes four newly detected Wnt genes from the millipede Glomeris marginata (Myriapoda: Diplopoda). Together with previous studies, now 11 Glomeris Wnt genes have been isolated and their expression has been studied. The only predicted but hitherto undetected Wnt gene is Wnt10. The new data provide a platform for the comparison of Wnt gene expression patterns in arthropods and reveal conserved as well as diverged aspects of Wnt gene expression in Arthropoda. Prominent expression of Wnt4 in dorsal tissue implies a role in dorsal segmentation and suggests that Wnt4 may be the predicted substitute for the previously reported missing expression of wg/Wnt1 in dorsal tissue.",2014,"Ralf Janssen, Nico Posnien"

The gene always early (aly) is one of the rapidly evolving genes in the genus Drosophila and plays a central role in regulating meiosis. Here we examined the rate of molecular evolution of aly in cytoraces of Drosophila and demonstrated that the rate of substitutions amongst cytoraces is around eight times greater than their parents and even amongst species of subgenera. Thus, the presence of positive selection in the laboratory-derived cytoraces based on the analysis of the synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution rates of aly suggests the rapid evolution in cytoraces.",2014,"P N Radhika, N B Ramachandra"

Binding of insecticidal lectin Colocasia esculenta tuber agglutinin (CEA) to midgut receptors of Bemisia tabaci and Lipaphis erysimi provides clues to its insecticidal potential,24753494,10.1002/pmic.201300408,"The insecticidal potential of Galanthus nivalis agglutinin-related lectins against hemipterans has been experimentally proven. However, the basis behind the toxicity of these lectins against hemipterans remains elusive. The present study elucidates the molecular basis behind insecticidal efficacy of Colocasia esculenta tuber agglutinin (CEA) against Bemisia tabaci and Lipaphis erysimi. Confocal microscopic analyses highlighted the binding of 25 kDa stable homodimeric lectin to insect midgut. Ligand blots followed by LC MS/MS analyses identified binding partners of CEA as vacuolar ATP synthase and sarcoplasmic endoplasmic reticulum type Ca(2+) ATPase from B. tabaci, and ATP synthase, heat shock protein 70 and clathrin heavy chain assembly protein from L. erysimi. Internalization of CEA into hemolymph was confirmed by Western blotting. Glycoprotein nature of the receptors was identified through glycospecific staining. Deglycosylation assay indicated the interaction of CEA with its receptors to be probably glycan mediated. Surface plasmon resonance analysis revealed the interaction kinetics between ATP synthase of B. tabaci with CEA. Pathway prediction study based on Drosophila homologs suggested the interaction of CEA with insect receptors that probably led to disruption of cellular processes causing growth retardation and loss of fecundity of target insects.

"Hexameric GFP and mCherry reporters for the Drosophila GAL4, Q, and LexA transcription systems",24451596,10.1534/genetics.113.161141,"The ability to distinguish cells and tissues of interest is critical for understanding their biological importance. In genetic model organisms, a prominent approach for discerning particular cells or tissues from others is the use of cell or tissue-specific enhancers to drive fluorescent reporters. This approach, however, is often limited by the brightness of the fluorescent reporter. To augment the ability to visualize cells or tissues of interest in Drosophila melanogaster, homo-hexameric GFP and mCherry reporters were developed for the GAL4, Q, and LexA transcription systems and functionally validated in vivo. The GFP and mCherry homo-hexameric fusion proteins exhibited significantly enhanced fluorescence as compared to monomeric fluorescent reporters and could be visualized by direct fluorescence throughout the cytoplasm of neurons, including the fine processes of axons and dendrites. These high-sensitivity fluorescent reporters of cell morphology can be utilized for a variety of purposes, especially facilitating fluorescence-based genetic screens for cell morphology phenotypes.

"Gene duplication, lineage-specific expansion, and subfunctionalization in the MADF-BESS family patterns the Drosophila wing hinge",24336749,10.1534/genetics.113.160531,"Gene duplication, expansion, and subsequent diversification are features of the evolutionary process. Duplicated genes can be lost, modified, or altered to generate novel functions over evolutionary timescales. These features make gene duplication a powerful engine of evolutionary change. In this study, we explore these features in the MADF-BESS family of transcriptional regulators. In Drosophila melanogaster, the family contains 16 similar members, each containing an N-terminal, DNA-binding MADF domain and a C-terminal, protein-interacting, BESS domain. Phylogenetic analysis shows that members of the MADF-BESS family are expanded in the Drosophila lineage. Three members, which we name hinge1, hinge2, and hinge3 are required for wing development, with a critical role in the wing hinge. hinge1 is a negative regulator of Winglesss expression and interacts with core wing-hinge patterning genes such as teashirt, homothorax, and jing. Double knockdowns along with heterologous rescue experiments are used to demonstrate that members of the MADF-BESS family retain function in the wing hinge, in spite of expansion and diversification for over 40 million years. The wing hinge connects the blade to the thorax and has critical roles in fluttering during flight.

The degradome and the evolution of Drosophila sex peptide as a ligand for the MIP receptor,24398368,10.1016/j.peptides.2013.12.016,"The male sex peptide (SP) of Drosophila melanogaster has wide ranging effects on females, including rejection of courting males, increased egg production, changes to the feeding habit, increased synthesis of antimicrobial peptides and elevated locomotor activity during day-time. The peptide activates receptors in sensory neurons of the female reproductive tract and can also traverse into the hemolymph and reach the central nervous system. The SP receptor involved in rejection and egg-laying responses has been shown to be identical to the receptor for the evolutionary conserved myoinhibitory peptides (MIPs) that function as neuropeptides in both males and females. Intriguingly, MIPs cannot substitute for SP when either expressed in the male accessory glands or injected into virgin females. MIPs are linear peptides with an amidated C-terminus which protects them from cleavage by carboxypeptidases, but leaves them exposed to potential attack from aminopeptidase and endopeptidase activities. In contrast, the SP region responsible for eliciting the post-mating response is cyclic and has several hydroxyproline residues N-terminal to the disulfide bridge which is expected to protect the biological activity of SP from peptidases of the male accessory gland and seminal fluid. We now present in vitro data showing that SP is metabolically stable, whereas MIPs are much more susceptible to degradation by peptidases of the male accessory gland and the hemolymph of virgin female D. melanogaster. SP has evolved relatively recently as a MIP receptor ligand that is particularly well adapted to surviving in the hostile degradome of the male accessory gland and seminal fluid.",2014,"R Elwyn Isaac, Young-Joon Kim, Neil Audsley"
Interlocked loops trigger lineage specification and stable fates in the Drosophila nervous system,25066644,10.1038/ncomms5484,"Multipotent precursors are plastic cells that generate different, stable fates at the correct number, place and time, to allow tissue and organ formation. While fate determinants are known to trigger specific transcriptional programs, the molecular pathway driving the progression from multipotent precursors towards stable and specific identities remains poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that, in Drosophila neural precursors, the glial determinant glial cell missing (Gcm) acts as a 'time bomb' and triggers its own degradation once the glial programme is stably activated. This requires a sequence of transcriptional and posttranscriptional loops, whereby a Gcm target first affects the expression and then acetylation of the fate determinant, thus controlling Gcm levels and stability over time. Defective homeostasis between the loops alters the neuron:glia ratio and freezes cells in an intermediate glial/neuronal phenotype.

Sensing of amino acids in a dopaminergic circuitry promotes rejection of an incomplete diet in Drosophila,24485457,10.1016/j.cell.2013.12.024,"The brain is the central organizer of food intake, matching the quality and quantity of the food sources with organismal needs. To ensure appropriate amino acid balance, many species reject a diet lacking one or several essential amino acids (EAAs) and seek out a better food source. Here, we show that, in Drosophila larvae, this behavior relies on innate sensing of amino acids in dopaminergic (DA) neurons of the brain. We demonstrate that the amino acid sensor GCN2 acts upstream of GABA signaling in DA neurons to promote avoidance of the EAA-deficient diet. Using real-time calcium imaging in larval brains, we show that amino acid imbalance induces a rapid and reversible activation of three DA neurons that are necessary and sufficient for food rejection.

Oncogenic Ras stimulates Eiger/TNF exocytosis to promote growth,25411211,10.1242/dev.108092,"Oncogenic mutations in Ras deregulate cell death and proliferation to cause cancer in a significant number of patients. Although normal Ras signaling during development has been well elucidated in multiple organisms, it is less clear how oncogenic Ras exerts its effects. Furthermore, cancers with oncogenic Ras mutations are aggressive and generally resistant to targeted therapies or chemotherapy. We identified the exocytosis component Sec15 as a synthetic suppressor of oncogenic Ras in an in vivo Drosophila mosaic screen. We found that oncogenic Ras elevates exocytosis and promotes the export of the pro-apoptotic ligand Eiger (Drosophila TNF). This blocks tumor cell death and stimulates overgrowth by activating the JNK-JAK-STAT non-autonomous proliferation signal from the neighboring wild-type cells. Inhibition of Eiger/TNF exocytosis or interfering with the JNK-JAK-STAT non-autonomous proliferation signaling at various steps suppresses oncogenic Ras-mediated overgrowth.

Casein kinase 1 promotes synchrony of the circadian clock network,24820422,10.1128/MCB.01571-13,"Casein kinase 1, known as DOUBLETIME (DBT) in Drosophila melanogaster, is a critical component of the circadian clock that phosphorylates and promotes degradation of the PERIOD (PER) protein. However, other functions of DBT in circadian regulation are not clear, in part because severe reduction of dbt causes preadult lethality. Here we report the molecular and behavioral phenotype of a viable dbt(EY02910) loss-of-function mutant. We found that DBT protein levels are dramatically reduced in adult dbt(EY02910) flies, and the majority of mutant flies display arrhythmic behavior, with a few showing weak, long-period (∼32 h) rhythms. Peak phosphorylation of PER is delayed, and both hyper- and hypophosphorylated forms of the PER and CLOCK proteins are present throughout the day. In addition, molecular oscillations of the circadian clock are dampened. In the central brain, PER and TIM expression is heterogeneous and decoupled in the canonical clock neurons of the dbt(EY02910) mutants. We also report an interaction between dbt and the signaling pathway involving pigment dispersing factor (PDF), a synchronizing peptide in the clock network.

Drosophila models for studying iron-related neurodegenerative diseases,24553869,,"In recent years, iron has been regarded as a common pathological feature of many neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA).

However, whether iron abnormalities represent a primary or secondary event still remains unknown. Due to the limitation in transgenic rodent model construction and transfection systems, the progress in unraveling the pathogenic role of different iron-related proteins in neurodegenerative diseases has been slow. Drosophila melanogaster, a simple organism which has a shorter lifespan and smaller genome with many conserved genes, and captures many features of human nervous system and neurodegeneration, may help speed up the progress. The characteristics that spatial- and temporal-specific transgenic Drosophila can be easily constructed and raised in large quantity with phenotype easily determined turn Drosophila into an excellent in vivo genetic system for screening iron-related modifiers in different neurodegenerative conditions and hence provide a better picture about the pathogenic contribution of different iron-related protein abnormalities. It is believed that identification of important iron-related genes that can largely stop or even reverse degenerative process in Drosophila models may lead to development of novel therapeutic strategies against neurodegenerative diseases.",2014,"Wing-Ho Yung, Zhou-Jing Zhu, Ka-Chun Wu, Zhong-Ming Qian, Ya Ke"
Components of the dorsal-ventral pathway also contribute to anterior-posterior patterning in honeybee embryos (Apis mellifera),24620747,10.1186/2041-9139-5-11,"Background: A key early step in embryogenesis is the establishment of the major body axes; the dorsal-ventral (DV) and anterior-posterior (AP) axes. Determination of these axes in some insects requires the function of different sets of signalling pathways for each axis. Patterning across the DV axis requires interaction between the Toll and Dpp/TGF-β pathways, whereas patterning across the AP axis requires gradients of bicoid/orthodenticle proteins and the actions of a hierarchy of gene transcription factors. We examined the expression and function of Toll and Dpp signalling during honeybee embryogenesis to assess to the role of these genes in DV patterning. Results: Pathway components that are required for dorsal specification in Drosophila are expressed in an AP-restricted pattern in the honeybee embryo, including Dpp and its receptor Tkv. Components of the Toll pathway are expressed in a more conserved pattern along the ventral axis of the embryo. Late-stage embryos from RNA interference (RNAi) knockdown of Toll and Dpp pathways had both DV and AP patterning defects, confirmed by staining with Am-sna, Am-zen, Am-eve, and Am-twi at earlier stages. We also identified two orthologues of dorsal in the honeybee genome, with one being expressed during embryogenesis and having a minor role in axis patterning, as determined by RNAi and the other expressed during oogenesis. Conclusions: We found that early acting pathways (Toll and Dpp) are involved not only in DV patterning but also AP patterning in honeybee embryogenesis. Changes to the expression patterns and function of these genes may reflect evolutionary changes in the placement of the extra-embryonic membranes during embryogenesis with respect to the AP and DV axes.",2014,"Megan J Wilson, Nathan J Kenny, Peter K Dearden"
Induction of endocycles represses apoptosis independently of differentiation and predisposes cells to genome instability,24284207,10.1242/dev.098871,"The endocycle is a common developmental cell cycle variation wherein cells become polyploid through repeated genome duplication without mitosis. We previously showed that Drosophila endocycling cells repress the apoptotic cell death response to genotoxic stress. Here, we investigate whether it is differentiation or endocycle remodeling that promotes apoptotic repression. We find that when nurse and follicle cells switch into endocycles during oogenesis they repress the apoptotic response to DNA damage caused by ionizing radiation, and that this repression has been conserved in the genus Drosophila over 40 million years of evolution. Follicle cells defective for Notch signaling failed to switch into endocycles or differentiate and remained apoptotic competent. However, genetic ablation of mitosis by knockdown of Cyclin A or overexpression of fzr/Cdh1 induced follicle cell endocycles and repressed apoptosis independently of Notch signaling and differentiation. Cells recovering from these induced endocycles regained apoptotic competence, showing that repression is reversible. Recovery from fzr/Cdh1 overexpression also resulted in an error-prone mitosis with amplified centrosomes and high levels of chromosome loss and fragmentation. Our results reveal an unanticipated link between endocycles and the repression of apoptosis, with broader implications for how endocycles may contribute to genome instability and oncogenesis.",2014,"Brian R Calvi, Michael Dixon, Bingqing Zhang, Christiane Hassel"
Role of histone H2A ubiquitination in Polycomb silencing,15386022,10.1038/nature02985,"Covalent modification of histones is important in regulating chromatin dynamics and transcription. One example of such modification is ubiquitination, which mainly occurs on histones H2A and H2B. Although recent studies have uncovered the enzymes involved in histone H2B ubiquitination and a 'cross-talk' between H2B ubiquitination and histone methylation, the responsible enzymes and the functions of H2A ubiquitination are unknown. Here we report the purification and functional characterization of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that is specific for histone H2A. The complex, termed hPRC1L (human Polycomb repressive complex 1-like), is composed of several Polycomb-group proteins including Ring1, Ring2, Bmi1 and HPH2. hPRC1L monoubiquitinates nucleosomal histone H2A at lysine 119. Reducing the expression of Ring2 results in a dramatic decrease in the level of ubiquitinated H2A in HeLa cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated colocalization of dRing with ubiquitinated H2A at the PRE and promoter regions of the Drosophila Ubx gene in wing imaginal discs. Removal of dRing in SL2 tissue culture cells by RNA interference resulted in loss of H2A ubiquitination concomitant with derepression of Ubx. Thus, our studies identify the H2A ubiquitin ligase, and link H2A ubiquitination to Polycomb silencing.",2004,"Hediye Erdjument-Bromage, Miguel Vidal, Yi Zhang, Paul Tempst, Hengbin Wang, Liangjun Wang, Richard S Jones"
Phosphorylation of conserved casein kinase sites regulates cAMP-response element-binding protein DNA binding in Drosophila,14676200,10.1074/jbc.M212839200,"The Drosophila homolog of cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB), dCREB2, exists with serine 231, equivalent to mammalian serine 133, in a predominantly phosphorylated state. Thus, unlike the mammalian protein, the primary regulation of dCREB2 may occur at a different step from serine 231 phosphorylation. Although bacterially expressed dCREB2 bound cAMP-response element sites, protein from Drosophila extracts was unable to do so unless treated with phosphatase. Phosphorylation of recombinant protein by casein kinase (CK) I or II, but not calcium-calmodulin kinase II or protein kinase A, inhibited DNA binding. Up to four conserved CK sites likely to be phosphorylated in vivo were responsible for this effect, and these sites were phosphorylated by a kinase present in Drosophila cell extracts that biochemically resembles CKII. We propose that the relative importance of different signaling pathways in regulating CREB activity may differ between Drosophila and mammals. In Drosophila, the dephosphorylation of CK sites appears to be the major regulatory step, while phosphorylation of serine 231 is necessary but secondary.",2004,"Jerry C P Yin, Hong Zhou, Wei Jiang, Priscilla Wu, Junjiro Horiuchi"
The roles of cis-inactivation by Notch ligands and of neuralized during eye and bristle patterning in Drosophila,15113404,10.1186/1471-213X-4-5,"Background: The receptor protein Notch and its ligand Delta are expressed throughout proneural regions yet non-neural precursor cells are defined by Notch activity and neural precursor cells by Notch inactivity. Not even Delta overexpression activates Notch in neural precursor cells. It is possible that future neural cells are protected by cis-inactivation, in which ligands block activation of Notch within the same cell. The Delta-ubiquitin ligase Neuralized has been proposed to antagonize cis-inactivation, favoring Notch activation. Cis-inactivation and role of Neuralized have not yet been studied in tissues where neural precursor cells are resistant to nearby Delta, however, such as the R8 cells of the eye or the bristle precursor cells of the epidermis. Results: Overexpressed ligands could block Notch signal transduction cell-autonomously in non-neural cells of the epidermis and retina, but did not activate Notch nonautonomously in neural cells. High ligand expression levels were required for cis-inactivation, and Serrate was more effective than Delta, although Delta is the ligand normally regulating neural specification. Differences between Serrate and Delta depended on the extracellular domains of the respective proteins. Neuralized was found to act cell nonautonomously in signal-sending cells during eye development, inconsistent with the view that Neuralized antagonizes cis-inactivation in non-neural cells. Conclusions: Delta and Neuralized contribute cell nonautonomously to Notch signaling in neurogenesis, and the model that Neuralized antagonizes cis-inactivation to permit Notch activity and specification of non-neural cells is refuted. The molecular mechanism rendering Notch insensitive to paracrine activation in neural precursor cells remains uncertain.",2004,"Nicholas E Baker, Yanxia Li"
Fraenkel's pupariation factor identified at last,15302596,10.1016/j.ydbio.2004.05.021,"Thirty-five years ago, Zdarek and Fraenkel demonstrated that nervous tissue extracts influenced development by accelerating pupariation in the grey flesh fly, Neobellieria bullata. We have now identified this pupariation factor as SVQFKPRLamide, designated Neb-pyrokinin-2 (Neb-PK-2). To achieve this, the central nervous system of N. bullata wandering stage larvae, that is, preceding pupariation, were dissected and extracted before HPLC separation. Chromatographic fractions were screened with a bioassay for pupariation accelerating activity. Only one fraction showed huge pupariation activity. Mass spectrometry revealed the presence of a pyrokinin, whose primary sequence could not be unequivocally determined by tandem mass spectrometry. However, this Neb-pyrokinin appeared to be very prominent in the ring gland from which it was subsequently purified and identified. Synthetic Neb-PK-2 accelerates pupariation with a threshold dose of only 0.2 pmol and therefore, Neb-pyrokinin is considered to be the genuine pupariation factor. The immunohistochemical distribution pattern of Neb-PK-2 is very similar to that of Drosophila pyrokinin-2, from which it differs by only one amino acid residue. Hence, the recently identified G-protein coupled receptors (CG8784, CG8795) for Drosophila pyrokinin-2 might play an important role in puparium formation.",2004,"Arnold De Loof, Elke Clynen, Liliane Schoofs, Jurgen Huybrechts, Peter Verleyen, Jan Zdarek, Luc Vanden Bosch, Alfons Van Lommel"
Temporal control of differentiation by the insulin receptor/tor pathway in Drosophila,15454083,10.1016/j.cell.2004.08.028,"Multicellular organisms must integrate growth and differentiation precisely to pattern complex tissues. Despite great progress in understanding how different cell fates are induced, it is poorly understood how differentiation decisions are temporally regulated. In a screen for patterning mutants, we isolated alleles of tsc1, a component of the insulin receptor (InR) growth control pathway. We find that loss of tsc1 disrupts patterning due to a loss of temporal control of differentiation. tsc1 controls the timing of differentiation downstream or in parallel to the RAS/MAPK pathway. Examination of InR, PI3K, PTEN, Tor, Rheb, and S6 kinase mutants demonstrates that increased InR signaling leads to precocious differentiation while decreased signaling leads to delays in differentiation. Importantly, cell fates are unchanged, but tissue organization is lost upon loss of developmental timing controls. These data suggest that intricate developmental decisions are coordinated with nutritional status and tissue growth by the InR signaling pathway.",2004,"Joseph M Bateman, Helen McNeill"
An enhancer trap in the ascidian Ciona intestinalis identifies enhancers of its Musashi orthologous gene,15501231,10.1016/j.ydbio.2004.08.029,"The enhancer trap technique, established in Drosophila melanogaster, is a very sophisticated tool. Despite its usefulness, however, there have been very few reports on enhancer traps in other animals. The ascidian Ciona intestinalis, a splendid experimental system for developmental biology, provides good material for developmental genetics. Recently, germline transgenesis of C. intestinalis has been achieved using the Tc1/mariner superfamily transposon Minos. During the course of that study, one Minos insertion line that showed a different GFP expression pattern from other lines was isolated. One fascinating possibility is that an enhancer trap event occurred in this line. Here we show that a Minos insertion in the Ci-Musashi gene was responsible for the altered GFP expression. Ci-Musashi showed a similar expression pattern to GFP. In addition, introns of Ci-Musashi have enhancer activity that can alter the expression pattern of nearby genes to resemble that of GFP in this line. These results clearly demonstrate that an enhancer trap event that entrapped enhancers of Ci-Musashi occurred in C. intestinalis.",2004,"Satoko Awazu, Terumi Matsuoka, Nori Satoh, Yasunori Sasakura, Akane Sasaki"
Outer pore architecture of a Ca2+-selective TRP channel,14736889,10.1074/jbc.M312076200,"The TRP superfamily forms a functionally important class of cation channels related to the product of the Drosophila trp gene. TRP channels display an unusual diversity in activation mechanisms and permeation properties, but the basis of this diversity is unknown, as the structure of these channels has not been studied in detail. To obtain insight in the pore architecture of TRPV6, a Ca(2+)-selective member of the TRPV subfamily, we probed the dimensions of its pore and determined pore-lining segments using cysteine-scanning mutagenesis. Based on the permeability of the channel to organic cations, we estimated a pore diameter of 5.4 A. Mutating Asp(541), a residue involved in high affinity Ca(2+) binding, altered the apparent pore diameter, indicating that this residue lines the narrowest part of the pore. Cysteines introduced in a region preceding Asp(541) displayed a cyclic pattern of reactivity to Ag(+) and cationic methylthio-sulfanate reagents, indicative of a pore helix. The anionic methanethiosulfonate ethylsulfonate showed only limited reactivity in this region, consistent with the presence of a cation-selective filter at the outer part of the pore helix. Based on these data and on homology with the bacterial KcsA channel, we present the first structural model of a TRP channel pore. We conclude that main structural features of the outer pore, namely a selectivity filter preceded by a pore helix, are conserved between K(+) channels and TRPV6. However, the selectivity filter of TRPV6 is wider than that of K(+) channels and lined by amino acid side chains rather than main chain carbonyls.",2004,"Guy Droogmans, Bernd Nilius, Annelies Janssens, Thomas Voets"

Here, we investigated the transcriptional regulation of other heat-shock-responsive genes (Hsp23, Hsp26, Hsp83 and Hsrw) in D. triauraria with relation to diapause. The results revealed that these genes are not regulated as a function of diapause, suggesting that they are not involved in the expression of diapause in this species.",2004,"Masahito T Kimura, Shin G Goto"
Senseless is required for pupal retinal development in Drosophila,15083519,10.1002/gene.20018,"Drosophila sensory organs are specified by a family of proneural genes which induce the expression of several common targets.

We also found that Senseless is expressed in neural precursors shortly after the larval-pupal transition and is both necessary and sufficient for interommatidial bristle development. Furthermore, senseless is the primary target of achaete and scute during interommatidial bristle development. We also identified several differences between the development of interommatidial bristles and other macrochaete. In particular, EGFR signaling is not required for interommatidial bristle development, nor is positive feedback regulation of proneural genes by senseless. A model for interommatidial bristle specification is presented.",2004,"Matthew F Rose, Mark Mamlouk, Graeme Mardon, Benjamin J Frankfort, Kathryn L Pepple"

"Drosophila DDP1, a multi-KH-domain protein, contributes to centromeric silencing and chromosome segregation",15380062,10.1016/j.cub.2004.09.024,"Background: The Drosophila melanogaster DDP1 protein is a highly evolutionarily conserved protein that is characterised by the presence of 15 tandemly organized KH domains, known for mediating high-affinity binding to single-stranded nucleic acids (RNA and ssDNA). Consistent with its molecular organization, DDP1 binds single-stranded nucleic acids with high affinity, in vitro. It was shown earlier that, in polytene chromosomes, DDP1 is found in association with chromocenter heterochromatin, suggesting a contribution to heterochromatin formation and/or maintenance. Results: In this paper, the actual contribution of DDP1 to the structural and functional properties of heterochromatin was determined through the analysis of the phenotypes associated with the hypomorphic ddp1(15.1) mutation that was generated through the mobilization of a P element inserted in the second intron of ddp1. ddp1(15.1) behaves as a dominant suppressor of PEV in the variegated rearrangement In(1)w(m4) as well as in several transgenic lines showing variegated expression of a hsp70-white(+) transgene. In polytene chromosomes from homozygous ddp1(15.1) larvae, histone H3-K9 methylation and HP1 deposition at chromocentre heterochromatin are strongly reduced. Our results also show that, when the maternal contribution of DDP1 is reduced, chromosome condensation and segregation are compromised. Moreover, in a ddp1(15.1) mutant background, transmission of the nonessential Dp1187 minichromosome is reduced. Conclusions: We conclude that DDP1 contributes to the structural and functional properties of heterochromatin. These results are discussed in the context of current models for the formation and maintenance of heterochromatin; in these models, HP1 deposition depends on H3-K9 methylation that, in turn, requires the contribution of the RNAi pathway.",2004,"Jordi Casanova, Alfred Cortés, Dori Huertas, Fernando Azorín"
The Zuker collection: a resource for the analysis of autosomal gene function in Drosophila melanogaster,15166147,10.1534/genetics.167.1.203,"The majority of genes of multicellular organisms encode proteins with functions that are not required for viability but contribute to important physiological functions such as behavior and reproduction.

From approximately 72,000 F(3) cultures segregating for autosomes heavily treated with ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS), approximately 12,000 lines in which the treated second or third chromosome survived in homozygous condition were selected.

The plant endosomal system--its structure and role in signal transduction and plant development,15221385,10.1007/s00425-004-1302-x,"Endosomes are highly dynamic membrane systems that receive endocytosed plasma membrane proteins and sort them for either degradation or recycling back to the cell surface. In addition, they receive newly synthesised proteins destined for vacuolar/lysosomal compartments. Sorting in the endosomes is necessary for the establishment and maintenance of cell polarity and it is needed to control levels and function of receptors and transporters at the cellular surface. Both processes are crucial for correct cell behaviour during tissue and organ development and for intercellular communication in general. It has therefore become an imperative to investigate structure and function of the endosomal system if we want to obtain a deeper mechanistic understanding of signal transduction and development. This review will compare our current understanding of endosomal trafficking in animals and yeast with what is known in plants, and will highlight some important breakthroughs in our understanding of the role of endosomes in signal transduction and multicellular development in Drosophila, as well as in Arabidopsis.",2004,Niko Geldner
The epithelial-mesenchymal transition of the Drosophila mesoderm requires the Rho GTP exchange factor Pebble,15128661,10.1242/dev.01150,"Drosophila pebble (pbl) encodes a Rho-family GTP exchange factor (GEF) required for cytokinesis. The accumulation of high levels of PBL protein during interphase and the developmentally regulated expression of pbl in mesodermal tissues suggested that the primary cytokinetic mutant phenotype might be masking other roles. Using various muscle differentiation markers, we found that Even skipped (EVE) expression in the dorsal mesoderm is greatly reduced in pbl mutant embryos. EVE expression in the dorsalmost mesodermal cells is induced in response to DPP secreted by the dorsal epidermal cells. Further analysis revealed that this phenotype is likely to be a consequence of an earlier defect. pbl mutant mesodermal cells fail to undergo the normal epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and dorsal migration that follows ventral furrow formation. This phenotype is not a secondary consequence of failed cytokinesis, as it is rescued by a mutant form of pbl that does not rescue the cytokinetic defect. In wild-type embryos, newly invaginated cells at the lateral edges of the mesoderm extend numerous protrusions. In pbl mutant embryos, however, cells appear more tightly adhered to their neighbours and extend very few protrusions. Consistent with the dependence of the mesoderm EMT and cytokinesis on actin organisation, the GTP exchange function of the PBL RhoGEF is required for both processes. By contrast, the N-terminal BRCT domains of PBL are required only for the cytokinetic function of PBL. These studies reveal that a novel PBL-mediated intracellular signalling pathway operates in mesodermal cells during the transition from an epithelial to migratory mesenchymal morphology during gastrulation.",2004,"Michael J Murray, Robert Saint, Masha Smallhorn"
"Comparative analysis of the Kekkon molecules, related members of the LIG superfamily",15179511,10.1007/s00427-004-0414-4,"Leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) and immunoglobulin (Ig) domains represent two of the most abundant sequence elements in metazoan proteomes.

One LIG whose function has been investigated is the Drosophila protein Kekkon1 (Kek1). In vivo studies have demonstrated a role for Kek1 in Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) signaling and have suggested a role in neuronal pathfinding. Kek1 is the founding member of the Kek family, a group of six Drosophila transmembrane proteins that contain seven LRRs and a single Ig in their extracellular domains. While this arrangement of domains predicts a possible role as cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), to date little is known about the function or evolutionary relationship of these additional Kek molecules. Here we report that orthologs of Kek1, Kek2, Kek5, and Kek6 exist in the mosquito, Anopheles gambiae, and the honeybee, Apis mellifera, indicating that this family has been conserved for ~300 million years of evolutionary time. Comparative sequence analyses reveal remarkable identity among these orthologs, primarily in their extracellular regions. In contrast, the intracellular regions are more divergent, exhibiting only small pockets of conservation.

We analyzed the evolutionary rates of pan-eukaryotic protein families and identified those with higher rates in animals. The acceleration was shown to occur in: (i) the LCA of Metazoa or (ii) independently in the Metazoan phyla. A high proportion of the accelerated Metazoan protein families was found to participate in translation and ribosome biogenesis, particularly mitochondrial. By functional analysis we show that no metabolic pathway in animals evolved faster than in other organisms.

Inhibiting myosin VI expression in high-grade ovarian carcinoma cells impeded cell spreading and migration in vitro. Optical imaging and histopathologic studies revealed that inhibiting myosin VI expression reduces tumor dissemination in nude mice.

"Splicing of the period gene 3'-terminal intron is regulated by light, circadian clock factors, and phospholipase C",15060157,10.1128/mcb.24.8.3359-3372.2004,"The daily timing of circadian ( congruent with 24-h) controlled activity in many animals exhibits seasonal adjustments, responding to changes in photoperiod (day length) and temperature. In Drosophila melanogaster, splicing of an intron in the 3' untranslated region of the period (per) mRNA is enhanced at cold temperatures, leading to more rapid daily increases in per transcript levels and earlier ""evening"" activity. Here we show that daily fluctuations in the splicing of this intron (herein referred to as dmpi8) are regulated by the clock in a manner that depends on the photoperiod (day length) and temperature. Shortening the photoperiod enhances dmpi8 splicing and advances its cycle, whereas the amplitude of the clock-regulated daytime decline in splicing increases as temperatures rise. This suggests that at elevated temperatures the clock has a more pronounced role in maintaining low splicing during the day, a mechanism that likely minimizes the deleterious effects of daytime heat on the flies by favoring nocturnal activity during warm days. Light also has acute inhibitory effects, rapidly decreasing the proportion of dmpi8-spliced per transcript, a response that does not require a functional clock. Our results identify a novel nonphotic role for phospholipase C (no-receptor-potential-A [norpA]) in the temperature regulation of dmpi8 splicing.",2004,"John Majercak, Isaac Edery, Wen-Feng Chen"
Conspecific sperm precedence in sister species of Drosophila with overlapping ranges,15154554,10.1111/j.0014-3820.2004.tb00411.x,"Barriers to gene flow that act after mating but before fertilization are often overlooked in studies of reproductive isolation. Where species are sympatric, such ""cryptic"" isolating barriers may be important in maintaining species as distinct entities. Drosophila yakuba and its sister species D. santomea have overlapping ranges on the island of São Tomé, off the coast of West Africa. Previous studies have shown that the two species are strongly sexually isolated. However, the degree of sexual isolation observed in the laboratory cannot explain the low frequency (approximately 1%) of hybrids observed in nature. This study identifies two ""cryptic"" isolating barriers that may further reduce gene flow between D. yakuba and D. santomea where they are sympatric. First, noncompetitive gametic isolation has evolved between D. yakuba and D. santomea: heterospecific matings between the two species produce significantly fewer offspring than do conspecific matings. Second, conspecific sperm precedence (CSP) occurs when D. yakuba females mate with conspecific and heterospecific males. However, CSP is asymmetrical: D. santomea females do not show patterns of sperm usage consistent with CSP. Drosophila yakuba and D. santomea females also differ with respect to remating propensity after first mating with conspecific males.

Comparative structural modeling and inference of conserved protein classes in Drosophila seminal fluid,15345744,10.1073/pnas.0405579101,"The constituents of seminal fluid are a complex mixture of proteins and other molecules, most of whose functions have yet to be determined and many of which are rapidly evolving. As a step in elucidating the roles of these proteins and exposing potential functional similarities hidden by their rapid evolution, we performed comparative structural modeling on 28 of 52 predicted seminal proteins produced in the Drosophila melanogaster male accessory gland. Each model was characterized by defining residues likely to be important for structure and function. Comparisons of known protein structures with predicted accessory gland proteins (Acps) revealed similarities undetectable by primary sequence alignments.

"Drosophila contactin, a homolog of vertebrate contactin, is required for septate junction organization and paracellular barrier function",15459097,10.1242/dev.01372,"Septate junctions (SJs) in epithelial and neuronal cells play an important role in the formation and maintenance of charge and size selective barriers. They form the basis for the ensheathment of nerve fibers in Drosophila and for the attachment of myelin loops to axonal surface in vertebrates. The cell-adhesion molecules NRX IV/Caspr/Paranodin (NCP1), contactin and Neurofascin-155 (NF-155) are all present at the vertebrate axo-glial SJs. Mutational analyses have shown that vertebrate NCP1 and its Drosophila homolog, Neurexin IV (NRX IV) are required for the formation of SJs. In this study, we report the genetic, molecular and biochemical characterization of the Drosophila homolog of vertebrate contactin, CONT. Ultrastructural and dye-exclusion analyses of Cont mutant embryos show that CONT is required for organization of SJs and paracellular barrier function. We show that CONT, Neuroglian (NRG) (Drosophila homolog of NF-155) and NRX IV are interdependent for their SJ localization and these proteins form a tripartite complex. Hence, our data provide evidence that the organization of SJs is dependent on the interactions between these highly conserved cell-adhesion molecules.",2004,"Catherine Faivre-Sarrailh, Monique Laval, Michael Hortsch, Jingjun Li, Manzoor A Bhat, Swati Banerjee"
"Roles of USF, Ikaros and Sp proteins in the transcriptional regulation of the human reduced folate carrier B promoter",15214842,10.1042/BJ20040414,"The hRFC (human reduced folate carrier) is ubiquitously but differentially expressed in human tissues and its levels are regulated by up to seven non-coding regions (A1, A2, A, B, C, D and E) and at least four promoters. For the hRFC-B basal promoter, regulation involves binding of Sp (specificity protein) transcription factors to a critical GC-box. By transiently transfecting HT1080 cells with 5'- and 3'-deletion constructs spanning 1057 bp of upstream sequence, a transcriptionally important region was localized to 158 bp flanking the transcriptional start sites. By gel shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, USF (upstream stimulatory factor), Sp1 and Ikaros-related proteins were bound to consensus elements (one E-box, two GC-box and three Ikaros) within this region. The functional importance of these elements was confirmed by transient tranfections of HT1080 cells with hRFC-B reporter constructs in which they were mutated, and by co-transfections of Drosophila Mel-2 cells with wild-type hRFC-B promoter and expression constructs for USF1, USF2a, Sp1 and Ikaros 2 and 8. Both USF1 and Sp1 proteins transactivated the hRFC-B promoter. Sp1 combined with USF1 resulted in a synergistic transactivation. Identical results were obtained with USF2a. Ikaros 2 was a repressor of hRFC-B promoter activity whose effects were partly reversed by the dominant-negative Ikaros 8. In HT1080 cells, transfection with Ikaros 2 decreased endogenous hRFC-B transcripts, whereas USF1 and Sp1 increased transcript levels. Ikaros 2 also decreased reporter gene activity and levels of acetylated chromatin associated with the endogenous promoter. Collectively, these results identify transcriptionally important regions in the hRFC-B promoter that include multiple GC-box, Ikaros and E-box elements. Our results also suggest that co-operative interactions between transcription factors Sp1 and USF are essential for high-level hRFC-B transactivation and imply that these effects are modulated by the family of Ikaros proteins and by histone acetylation.",2004,"Mingjun Liu, Johnathan R Whetstine, Robin M Flatley, Larry H Matherly, Scott G Payton, Yubin Ge"

The transgenic flies expressed human Aβ42 and tau, and the overexpression of these human transgenes in the CNS of these flies produced progressive defects in motor function (antigeotaxic behavior) while reducing the animal's lifespan. Here, we demonstrate that both DHA-EE and DHA-H increase the longer chain fatty acids (≥18C) species in the heads of the flies, although only DHA-H produced an unknown chromatographic peak that corresponded to a non-hydroxylated lipid. In addition, only treatment with DHA-H prevented the abnormal climbing behavior and enhanced the lifespan of these transgenic flies. These benefits of DHA-H were confirmed in the well characterized transgenic PS1/APP mouse model of familial AD (5xFAD mice), mice that develop defects in spatial learning and in memory, as well as behavioral deficits.

"Participation of 14-3-3ε and 14-3-3ζ proteins in the phagocytosis, component of cellular immune response, in Aedes mosquito cell lines",28764795,10.1186/s13071-017-2267-5,"Background: Better knowledge of the innate immune system of insects will improve our understanding of mosquitoes as potential vectors of diverse pathogens. The ubiquitously expressed 14-3-3 protein family is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to mammals, and at least two isoforms of 14-3-3, the ε and ζ, have been identified in insects. These proteins have been shown to participate in both humoral and cellular immune responses in Drosophila. As mosquitoes of the genus Aedes are the primary vectors for arboviruses, causing several diseases such as dengue fever, yellow fever, Zika and chikungunya fevers, cell lines derived from these mosquitoes, Aag-2 from Aedes aegypti and C6/36 HT from Aedes albopictus, are currently used to study the insect immune system. Here, we investigated the role of 14-3-3 proteins (ε and ζ isoform) in phagocytosis, the main cellular immune responses executed by the insects, using Aedes spp. cell lines. Results: We evaluated the mRNA and protein expression of 14-3-3ε and 14-3-3ζ in C6/36 HT and Aag-2 cells, and demonstrated that both proteins were localised in the cytoplasm. Further, in C6/36 HT cells treated with a 14-3-3 specific inhibitor we observed a notable modification of cell morphology with filopodia-like structure caused through cytoskeleton reorganisation (co-localization of 14-3-3 proteins with F-actin), more importantly the decrease in Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus and E. coli phagocytosis and reduction in phagolysosome formation. Additionally, silencing of 14-3-3ε and 14-3-3ζ expression by mean of specific DsiRNA confirmed the decreased phagocytosis and phagolysosome formation of pHrodo labelled E. coli and S. aureus bacteria by Aag-2 cells.

Feeding minocycline to Drosophila larvae suppresses larval body growth and delays the timing of pupation in a dose-dependent manner. We found that the drug treatment decreased the activated form of Akt and S6K in peripheral tissues, which suggested that the insulin/target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling had been attenuated. Specifically enhancing TOR activity in the prothoracic gland (PG), the ecdysone-generating organ, attenuated the drug-induced developmental delay, which is consistent with the critical role of PG's TOR signaling in determining pupation time.

Rotifers are small aquatic invertebrates that have been used in aging studies for nearly 100 years and are now re-emerging as a modern model system. To provide a baseline to evaluate genetic responses to interventions that change health throughout lifespan and a framework for new hypotheses about the molecular genetic mechanisms of aging, we examined the transcriptome of an asexual female lineage of the rotifer Brachionus manjavacas at five life stages: eggs, neonates, and early-, late-, and post-reproductive adults. Results: There are widespread shifts in gene expression over the lifespan of B. manjavacas; the largest change occurs between neonates and early reproductive adults and is characterized by down-regulation of developmental genes and up-regulation of genes involved in reproduction. The expression profile of post-reproductive adults was distinct from that of other life stages. While few genes were significantly differentially expressed in the late- to post-reproductive transition, gene set enrichment analysis revealed multiple down-regulated pathways in metabolism, maintenance and repair, and proteostasis, united by genes involved in mitochondrial function and oxidative phosphorylation. Conclusions: This study provides the first examination of changes in gene expression over lifespan in rotifers. We detected differential expression of many genes with human orthologs that are absent in Drosophila and C. elegans, highlighting the potential of the rotifer model in aging studies. Our findings suggest that small but coordinated changes in expression of many genes in pathways that integrate diverse functions drive the aging process. The observation of simultaneous declines in expression of genes in multiple pathways may have consequences for health and longevity not detected by single- or multi-gene knockdown in otherwise healthy animals. Investigation of subtle but genome-wide change in these pathways during aging is an important area for future study.",2017,"David B Mark Welch, Kristin E Gribble"
Proliferation Cycle Causes Age Dependent Mitochondrial Deficiencies and Contributes to the Aging of Stem Cells,29257059,10.3390/genes8120397,"In addition to chronological aging, stem cells are also subject to proliferative aging during the adult life span. However, the consequences of proliferative cycle and their contributions to stem cells aging have not been well investigated. Using Drosophila female germ line stem cells as a model, we found that the replication cycle leads to the age dependent decline of female fecundity, and is a major factor causing developmental abnormalities in the progeny of old females. The proliferative aging does not cause telomere shortening, but causes an accumulation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations or rearrangements at the control region. We propose that damaging mutations on mtDNA caused by accumulation of proliferation cycles in aged stem cells may disrupt mitochondrial respiration chain and impair mtDNA replication and represent a conserved mechanism underlying stem cell aging.",2017,"Qiuting Ren, Fan Zhang, Hong Xu"
Growth and size control during development,29142108,10.1098/rsob.170190,"The size and shape of organs are characteristic for each species. Even when organisms develop to different sizes due to varying environmental conditions, such as nutrition, organ size follows species-specific rules of proportionality to the rest of the body, a phenomenon referred to as allometry. Therefore, for a given environment, organs stop growth at a predictable size set by the species's genotype. How do organs stop growth? How can related species give rise to organs of strikingly different size? No definitive answer has been given to date. One of the major models for the studies of growth termination is the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster. Therefore, this review will focus mostly on work carried out in Drosophila to try to tease apart potential mechanisms and identify routes for further investigation. One general rule, found across the animal kingdom, is that the rate of growth declines with developmental time. Therefore, answers to the problem of growth termination should explain this seemingly universal fact. In addition, growth termination is intimately related to the problems of robustness (i.e. precision) and plasticity in organ size, symmetric and asymmetric organ development, and of how the 'target' size depends on extrinsic, environmental factors.",2017,"Fernando Casares, Jannik Vollmer, Dagmar Iber"
Dual role of BMP signaling in the regulation of Drosophila intestinal stem cell self-renewal,28945500,10.1080/19336934.2017.1384104,"Many adult organs including Drosophila adult midguts rely on resident stem cells to replenish damaged cells during tissue homeostasis and regeneration. Previous studies have shown that, upon injury, intestinal stem cells (ISCs) in the midguts can increase proliferation and lineage differentiation to meet the demand for tissue repair. Our recent study has demonstrated that, in response to certain injury, midguts can expand ISC population size as an additional regenerative mechanism. We found that injury elicited by bleomycin feeding or bacterial infection increased the production of two BMP ligands (Dpp and Gbb) in enterocytes (ECs), leading to elevated BMP signaling in progenitor cells that drove an expansion of ISCs by promoting their symmetric self-renewing division. Interestingly, we also found that BMP signaling in ECs inhibits the production of Dpp and Gbb, and that this negative feedback mechanism is required to reset ISC pool size to the homeostatic state. Our findings suggest that BMP signaling exerts two opposing influences on stem cell activity depending on where it acts: BMP signaling in progenitor cells promotes ISC self-renewal while BMP signaling in ECs restricts ISC self-renewal by preventing excessive production of BMP ligands. Our results further suggest that transient expansion of ISC population in conjunction with increasing ISC proliferation provides a more effective strategy for tissue regeneration.",2017,"Jin Jiang, Aiguo Tian"
Nonstop-mRNA decay machinery is involved in the clearance of mRNA 5'-fragments produced by RNAi and NMD in Drosophila melanogaster cells,28115162,10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.01.092,"When translating mRNAs are cleaved in protein-coding regions, 5' fragments of mRNAs are detached from stop codons (i.e., nonstop mRNAs) and protected from 3'-5' exonucleases by ribosomes stalled at the 3' termini. It has been shown in yeast that the nonstop mRNA decay (NSD) machinery triggers nonstop mRNA degradation by removing stalled ribosomes in the artificial reporter mRNAs. However, it is not known well whether NSD is involved in the degradation of endogenous nonstop mRNAs in higher eukaryotes. In this work, we addressed the question of whether 5'-nonstop-mRNA fragments generated by siRNA cleavage or nonsense-mediated-mRNA decay (NMD) are degraded by the NSD pathway in Drosophila melanogaster cells by knocking down three NSD components, Pelota (a yeast Dom34 homolog), Hbs1 and ABCE1 (a ribosome-recycling factor). We found that double, but not single, knockdown of any two of these three factors efficiently stabilized nonstop reporter mRNAs and triple knockdown of Pelota, Hbs1 and ABCE1 further stabilized nonstop mRNAs in highly ribosome-associated state. These findings demonstrated that Pelota, Hbs1 and ABCE1 are crucial for NSD in Drosophila cells as in yeast for rescuing stalled ribosomes and degrading nonstop mRNAs.

Spatial regulation of contractility by Neuralized and Bearded during furrow invagination in Drosophila,29150614,10.1038/s41467-017-01482-8,"Embryo-scale morphogenesis arises from patterned mechanical forces. During Drosophila gastrulation, actomyosin contractility drives apical constriction in ventral cells, leading to furrow formation and mesoderm invagination. It remains unclear whether and how mechanical properties of the ectoderm influence this process. Here, we show that Neuralized (Neur), an E3 ubiquitin ligase active in the mesoderm, regulates collective apical constriction and furrow formation. Conversely, the Bearded (Brd) proteins antagonize maternal Neur and lower medial-apical contractility in the ectoderm: in Brd-mutant embryos, the ventral furrow invaginates properly but rapidly unfolds as medial MyoII levels increase in the ectoderm. Increasing contractility in the ectoderm via activated Rho similarly triggers furrow unfolding whereas decreasing contractility restores furrow invagination in Brd-mutant embryos. Thus, the inhibition of Neur by Brd in the ectoderm differentiates the mechanics of the ectoderm from that of the mesoderm and patterns the activity of MyoII along the dorsal-ventral axis.",2017,"Gantas Perez-Mockus, Vanessa Roca, Giulia Corradi, François Schweisguth, Khalil Mazouni, Vito Conte"
Drosophila β-Tubulin 97EF is upregulated at low temperature and stabilizes microtubules,29084803,10.1242/dev.156109,"Cells in ectotherms function normally within an often wide temperature range. As temperature dependence is not uniform across all the distinct biological processes, acclimation presumably requires complex regulation. The molecular mechanisms that cope with the disruptive effects of temperature variation are still poorly understood. Interestingly, one of five different β-tubulin paralogs, βTub97EF, was among the genes upregulated at low temperature in cultured Drosophila cells. As microtubules are known to be cold sensitive, we analyzed whether βTub97EF protects microtubules at low temperatures. During development at the optimal temperature (25°C), βTub97EF was expressed in a tissue-specific pattern primarily in the gut. There, as well as in hemocytes, expression was increased at low temperature (14°C). Although βTub97EF mutants were viable and fertile at 25°C, their sensitivity within the well-tolerated range was slightly enhanced during embryogenesis specifically at low temperatures. Changing β-tubulin isoform ratios in hemocytes demonstrated that β-Tubulin 97EF has a pronounced microtubule stabilizing effect. Moreover, βTub97EF is required for normal microtubule stability in the gut. These results suggest that βTub97EF upregulation at low temperature contributes to acclimation by stabilizing microtubules.",2017,"Johannes Bischof, Moritz Kirschmann, Faina Myachina, Fritz Bosshardt, Christian F Lehner"
Seasonal variation in basal and plastic cold tolerance: Adaptation is influenced by both long- and short-term phenotypic plasticity,28770063,10.1002/ece3.3112,"Understanding how thermal selection affects phenotypic distributions across different time scales will allow us to predict the effect of climate change on the fitness of ectotherms. We tested how seasonal temperature variation affects basal levels of cold tolerance and two types of phenotypic plasticity in Drosophila melanogaster. Developmental acclimation occurs as developmental stages of an organism are exposed to seasonal changes in temperature and its effect is irreversible, while reversible short-term acclimation occurs daily in response to diurnal changes in temperature. We collected wild flies from a temperate population across seasons and measured two cold tolerance metrics (chill-coma recovery and cold stress survival) and their responses to developmental and short-term acclimation. Chill-coma recovery responded to seasonal shifts in temperature, and phenotypic plasticity following both short-term and developmental acclimation improved cold tolerance. This improvement indicated that both types of plasticity are adaptive, and that plasticity can compensate for genetic variation in basal cold tolerance during warmer parts of the season when flies tend to be less cold tolerant. We also observed a significantly stronger trade-off between basal cold tolerance and short-term acclimation during warmer months. For the longer-term developmental acclimation, a trade-off persisted regardless of season. A relationship between the two types of plasticity may provide additional insight into why some measures of thermal tolerance are more sensitive to seasonal variation than others.",2017,"Suegene Noh, Theodore J Morgan, Christopher M Berger, Elizabeth R Everman"
The Drosophila Postsynaptic DEG/ENaC Channel ppk29 Contributes to Excitatory Neurotransmission,28213447,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3850-16.2017,"The protein family of degenerin/epithelial sodium channels (DEG/ENaCs) is composed of diverse animal-specific, non-voltage-gated ion channels that play important roles in regulating cationic gradients across epithelial barriers. Some family members are also enriched in neural tissues in both vertebrates and invertebrates. However, the specific neurophysiological functions of most DEG/ENaC-encoding genes remain poorly understood. The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is an excellent model for deciphering the functions of DEG/ENaC genes because its genome encodes an exceptionally large number of DEG/ENaC subunits termed pickpocket (ppk) 1-31 Here we demonstrate that ppk29 contributes specifically to the postsynaptic modulation of excitatory synaptic transmission at the larval neuromuscular junction. Electrophysiological data indicate that the function of ppk29 in muscle is necessary for normal postsynaptic responsivity to neurotransmitter release and for normal coordinated larval movement. The ppk29 mutation does not affect gross synaptic morphology and ultrastructure, which indicates that the observed phenotypes are likely due to defects in glutamate receptor function. Together, our data indicate that DEG/ENaC ion channels play a fundamental role in the postsynaptic regulation of excitatory neurotransmission.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Members of the degenerin/epithelial sodium channel (DEG/ENaC) family are broadly expressed in epithelial and neuronal tissues. To date, the neurophysiological functions of most family members remain unknown.

Retrograde semaphorin-plexin signalling drives homeostatic synaptic plasticity,28953869,10.1038/nature24017,"Homeostatic signalling systems ensure stable but flexible neural activity and animal behaviour. Presynaptic homeostatic plasticity is a conserved form of neuronal homeostatic signalling that is observed in organisms ranging from Drosophila to human. Defining the underlying molecular mechanisms of neuronal homeostatic signalling will be essential in order to establish clear connections to the causes and progression of neurological disease. During neural development, semaphorin-plexin signalling instructs axon guidance and neuronal morphogenesis. However, semaphorins and plexins are also expressed in the adult brain. Here we show that semaphorin 2b (Sema2b) is a target-derived signal that acts upon presynaptic plexin B (PlexB) receptors to mediate the retrograde, homeostatic control of presynaptic neurotransmitter release at the neuromuscular junction in Drosophila. Further, we show that Sema2b-PlexB signalling regulates presynaptic homeostatic plasticity through the cytoplasmic protein Mical and the oxoreductase-dependent control of presynaptic actin. We propose that semaphorin-plexin signalling is an essential platform for the stabilization of synaptic transmission throughout the developing and mature nervous system.

Difference in Dachsous Levels between Migrating Cells Coordinates the Direction of Collective Cell Migration,28898677,10.1016/j.devcel.2017.08.001,"In contrast to extracellular chemotactic gradients, how cell-adhesion molecules contribute to directing cell migration remains more elusive.

In each abdominal segment, the amount of Ds in each LEC varied along the axis of migration (Ds imbalance), which polarized Ds localization at cell boundaries. This Ds polarity was necessary for coordinating the migratory direction. Another atypical cadherin, Fat (Ft), and an unconventional myosin Dachs, both of which bind to Ds, also showed biased cell-boundary localizations, and both were required for the migration.

Constitutive scaffolding of multiple Wnt enhanceosome components by Legless/BCL9,28296634,10.7554/eLife.20882,"Wnt/β-catenin signaling elicits context-dependent transcription switches that determine normal development and oncogenesis. These are mediated by the Wnt enhanceosome, a multiprotein complex binding to the Pygo chromatin reader and acting through TCF/LEF-responsive enhancers. Pygo renders this complex Wnt-responsive, by capturing β-catenin via the Legless/BCL9 adaptor. We used CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering of Drosophila legless (lgs) and human BCL9 and B9L to show that the C-terminus downstream of their adaptor elements is crucial for Wnt responses. BioID proximity labeling revealed that BCL9 and B9L, like PYGO2, are constitutive components of the Wnt enhanceosome. Wnt-dependent docking of β-catenin to the enhanceosome apparently causes a rearrangement that apposes the BCL9/B9L C-terminus to TCF. This C-terminus binds to the Groucho/TLE co-repressor, and also to the Chip/LDB1-SSDP enhanceosome core complex via an evolutionary conserved element.

Restriction, Southern blot, PCR and sequencing analyses have shown that most Gandalf copies are about 1 kb long, are flanked by 12 bp inverted terminal repeats and contain subterminal repetitive regions on both sides of the element. As with other elements of the DNA-transposing type (known as the 'Ac family'), the Gandalf element generates 8 bp direct duplications at the insertion point. Coding region analysis has shown that the longer open reading frame found in Gandalf copies could encode part of a protein. However, whether or not the 1 kb copies of the element are actually the active transposons remains to be elucidated. Gandalf shows a very low copy number in D. buzzatii, a sibling species of D. koepferae. An attempt to induce interspecific hybrid dysgenesis in hybrids of these two species has been unsuccessful.",1995,"I Marín, A Fontdevila"
Cytogenetic and molecular localization of tipE: a gene affecting sodium channels in Drosophila melanogaster,7789768,,"Voltage-sensitive sodium channels play a key role in nerve cells where they are responsible for the increase in sodium permeability during the rising phase of action potentials. In Drosophila melanogaster a subset of temperature-sensitive paralytic mutations affect sodium channel function. One such mutation is temperature-induced paralysis locus E (tipE), which has been shown by electrophysiology and ligand binding studies to reduce sodium channel numbers. Three new gamma-ray-induced tipE alleles associated with either visible deletions in 64AB or a translocation breakpoint within 64B2 provide landmarks for positional cloning of tipE. Beginning with the flanking cloned gene Ras2, a 140-kb walk across the translocation breakpoint was completed. Germline transformation using a 42-kb cosmid clone and successively smaller subclones localized the tipE gene within a 7.4-kb genomic DNA segment. Although this chromosome region is rich in transcripts, only three overlapping mRNAs (5.4, 4.4, and 1.7 kb) lie completely within the smallest rescuing construct. The small sizes of the rescuing construct and transcripts suggest that tipE does not encode a standard sodium channel alpha-subunit with four homologous repeats. Sequencing these transcripts will elucidate the role of the tipE gene product in sodium channel functional regulation.",1995,"G Feng, D P Kasbekar, L M Hall, P Deák, D W Gil"

Conditions for the primary culture of eye imaginal discs from Drosophila melanogaster,8568517,10.1002/neu.480280309,"We have established a primary culture system for Drosophila eye imaginal discs. With this system, we were able to obtain neurite outgrowth from intact eye discs, eye disc fragments, and dissociated eye imaginal disc cells. Immunoreactivity to antibody 24B10 indicates that these extending neurites are photoreceptor axons. Three culture media were tested for their ability to support the survival of and neurite extension from eye disc fragments in vitro at 23 degrees C. These, with supplements, were: five parts of Schneider's Drosophila medium with four parts of basal Eagle's medium (""4 + 5""); Leibovitz's L-15 medium (L-15); and Shields and Sang's M3 modified medium (MM3). We obtained the best results with MM3 supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Eye disc fragments survived in this medium for at least 20 days. Pigmentation in the nonphotoreceptor pigment cells in cultures from the prepupa required the presence of 20-hydroxyecdysone (20-HE) (1 micrograms/ml), whereas neurite outgrowth was seen in the absence of 20-HE. Donor animals had to fall within a range of ages to obtain appropriate eye disc differentiation in vitro. Eye disc from 5-h pupae (P + 5) or older commenced ommachrome synthesis in vitro in a temporal sequence close to that found in vivo, whereas the in vitro synthesis of this pigment was delayed in eye discs from younger flies. Average neurite length was not affected by age among pupae younger than P + 5; but neurite outgrowth from P + 24 was scarce, probably because by this time photoreceptor axons had already grown in vivo and were severed and unable to regenerate in vitro. Eye discs taken from third instar larvae or white prepupae continued their mitotic activity in vitro. Together with the advance of the morphogenetic furrow at the leading edge of retinal development, this observation is consistent with the evidence that pattern formation continues in vitro. Morphogenetic changes were manifested in cultures. Viability tests with calcein AM and ethidium bromide revealed few dead cells in living cultures.",1995,"I A Meinertzhagen, C Li"
Dorso-ventral and rostro-caudal sequential expression of M-twist in the postimplantation murine embryo,7547472,10.1016/0925-4773(95)00369-x,"M-twist is the murine homolog of the Drosophila twist gene which is a zygotic target for maternal genes that establish embryonic dorso-ventral polarity and is necessary for mesoderm formation. We recently showed that before gastrulation, M-twist transcripts are detected in morulae and blastocysts, then in extra-embryonic tissues of early implanted mouse embryos before the onset of gastrulation, and we suggested that M-twist might be involved in embryonic polarity (Stoetzel et al., submitted). Here, using in situ hybridization on whole mount embryos, we present the expression pattern of M-twist from primitive streak stage up to 10.5 days p.c. In implanted embryos, M-twist is first expressed in extra-embryonic tissues, then in embryo proper around egg cylinder stage within some embryonic ectodermal cells of the primitive streak. Slightly later, scattered cells within the amniotic cavity apparently detached from the primitive streak also express the gene. Then, M-twist transcripts accumulate in head mesenchyme, the first aortic arches, somites and lateral mesoderm and, as development proceeds, successively the second, third and fourth branchial arches, the anterior limb buds and, finally, the posterior limb buds. Thus M-twist expression in implanted embryos occurs first along a dorso-ventral gradient pattern until the headfold stage, then it is gradually observed along the rostro-caudal axis of the embryos as development procedes in the mesodermal cell layer and in neural crest cell derivatives. In addition, we show the existence of some previously undescribed subsets of scattered cells that express M-twist and thus might participate in murine embryo development.",1995,"A L Bolcato-Bellemin, B Weber, P Bourgeois, F Perrin-Schmitt, C Stoetzel"
"An unusual mosaic protein with a protease domain, encoded by the nudel gene, is involved in defining embryonic dorsoventral polarity in Drosophila",7671306,10.1016/0092-8674(95)90475-1,"Dorsoventral polarity of the Drosophila embryo is induced by a ventral extracellular signal, which is produced by a locally activated protease cascade within the extraembryonic perivitelline compartment. Local activation of the protease cascade depends on a positional cue that is laid down during oogenesis outside the oocyte. Here we present evidence that the nudel gene encodes an essential component of this cue. The nudel gene, which is expressed in follicle cells covering the oocyte, encodes an unusual mosaic protein resembling an extracellular matrix protein with a central serine protease domain. Our findings suggest that embryonic dorsoventral polarity is defined by a positional cue that requires the nudel protein to anchor and to trigger the protease cascade producing the polarity-inducing signal.",1995,"C C Hong, C Hashimoto"
Selection and maintenance of sexual identity in the Drosophila germline,8601491,,"Unlike sex determination in the soma, which is an autonomous process, sex determination in the germline of Drosophila has both inductive and autonomous components. In this paper, we examined how sexual identity is selected and maintained in the Drosophila germline. We show that female-specific expression of genes in the germline is dependent on a somatic signaling pathway. This signaling pathway requires the sex-non-specific transformer 2 gene but, surprisingly, does not appear to require the sex-specific genes, transformer and doublesex. Moreover, in contrast to the soma where pathway initiation and maintenance are independent processes, the somatic signaling pathway appears to function continuously from embryogenesis to the larval stages to select and sustain female germline identity. We also show that the primary target for the somatic signaling pathway in germ cells can not be the Sex-lethal gene.",1995,"D Bopp, P Schedl, J I Horabin, J Waterbury"
White as a reporter gene to detect transcriptional silencers specifying position-specific gene expression during Drosophila melanogaster eye development,8582614,,"The white+ gene was used as a reporter to detect transcriptional silencer activity in the Drosophila genome. Changes in the spatial expression pattern of white were scored in the adult eye as nonuniform patterns of pigmentation. Thirty-six independent P[lacW] transposant lines were collected. These represent 12 distinct pigmentation patterns and probably 21 loci. The spatial pigmentation pattern is due to cis-acting suppression of white+ expression, and the suppression probably depends on cell position rather than cell type. The mechanism of suppression differs from inactivation by heterochromatin. In addition, activation of lacZ in P[lacW] occurs also in specific patterns in imaginal discs and embryos in many of the lines. The expression patterns of white+ and lacZ may reflect the activity of regulatory elements belonging to an endogenous gene near each P[lacW] insertion site. We speculate that these putative POSE (position-specific expression) genes may have a role in pattern formation of the eye as well as other imaginal structures. Three of the loci identified are optomotor-blind, engrailed and invected. teashirt is also implicated as a candidate gene. We propose that this ""silencer trap""' may be an efficient way of identifying genes involved in imaginal pattern formation.",1995,"C J Tsai, J Y Yeh, M M Green, J L Chao, Y H Sun, V N Bolshakov, T J Jaw, C T Yu"
Specificity for the hairy/enhancer of split basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins maps outside the bHLH domain and suggests two separable modes of transcriptional repression,8524259,10.1128/mcb.15.12.6923,"The Hairy/Enhancer of split/Deadpan family of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins function as transcriptional repressors. We have examined the mechanisms of repression used by the Hairy and E(SPL) proteins by assaying the antagonism between wild-type or altered Hairy/E(SPL) and Scute bHLH proteins during sex determination in Drosophila melanogaster. Domain swapping and mutagenesis of the Hairy and E(SPL) proteins show that three evolutionarily conserved domains are required for their function: the bHLH, Orange, and WRPW domains. However, the suppression of Scute activity by Hairy does not require the WRPW domain. We show that the Orange domain is an important functional domain that confers specificity among members of the Hairy/E(SPL) family. In addition, we show that a Xenopus Hairy homology conserves not only Hairy's structure but also its biological activity in our assays. We propose that transcriptional repression by the Hairy/E(SPL) family of bHLH proteins involves two separable mechanisms: repression of specific transcriptional activators, such as Scute, through the bHLH and Orange domains and repression of other activators via interaction of the C-terminal WRPW motif with corepressors, such as the Groucho protein.",1995,"H Weintraub, S M Parkhurst, D L Turner, S R Dawson"
scute (sis-b) function in Drosophila sex determination,7623836,10.1128/mcb.15.8.4430,"The primary sex determination signal, the X chromosome-to-autosome (X/A) ratio, controls the choice of sexual identity in the Drosophila melanogaster embryo by regulating the activity of the early promoter of the Sex-lethal gene, Sxl-Pe. This promoter is activated in females (2X/2A), while it remains off in males (1X/2A). Promoter activation in females is dependent upon X-linked numerator genes. One of these genes, sisterless-b (sis-b), corresponds to the scute (sc) locus of the achaete-scute complex, and it encodes a helix-loop-helix transcription factor. In the studies reported here we have used monoclonal antibodies to study the expression and functioning of the sc(sis-b) protein. Sc is first detected at nuclear cycle 6 to 7, well before Sxl-Pe is first active. At this stage, the protein is in the cytoplasm, not the nucleus. Only after the formation of the syncytial blastoderm, at nuclear cycle 10 to 11, does a substantial fraction of the protein enter the nucleus, and this nuclear import closely coincides with the initial activation of Sxl-Pe. Consistent with the idea that the dose of sc(sis-b) is critical for its function as an X-chromosome counting element, wild-type syncytial blastoderm embryos could be grouped into two classes based on the level of protein. Western blot (immunoblot) analysis demonstrates that this difference in protein level correlates directly with the activity state of the Sxl gene. Finally, we provide the first direct evidence that Sc forms heteromeric complexes in vivo in early embryos with the maternally derived helix-loop-helix protein Daughterless. This in vivo complex is likely to be critical for Sc function in Sxl-Pe activation.",1995,"J Stukey, G Deshpande, P Schedl"
Regulation of the P25 gene transcription in the silk gland of Bombyx,8574197,10.1016/0248-4900(96)81317-7,"The gene encoding the silk protein P25 is specifically transcribed in the posterior silkgland of Bombyx during larval intermoults and is repressed during moults. By performing in vitro DNA-protein interactions, at least five putative regulatory elements were localized in the 5' flanking region of the gene. The most proximal element, close to the TATA box, interacts with SGFB, a silkgland-specific factor which could be involved in the tissue-specific expression of the gene. A more upstream sequence is recognized by an ubiquitous factor, BMFA, which exhibits cyclical modifications in relation to the moulting cycle and could thus be involved in the temporal control of the gene during the development. A construct containing a reporter gene fused to 1450 bp of P25 5' flanking sequences was integrated into the Drosophila genome and shown to be specifically expressed in the larval salivary gland, the organ homologous to the silkgland. Recurrent deletions of this construct showed that the proximal 254 bp contain all the sequences required for this specific expression. Similar foreign constructs introduced in the silkgland in vivo by a particle delivery system were specifically transcribed in the posterior silkgland but remained silent in the middle silkgland as the endogenous genes. This methodology will be used to assay the function of the defined cis-acting elements in the spatial regulation of expression of P25.",1995,"P Nony, P Couble, J C Prudhomme"

Genetic analysis of embryonic cis-acting regulatory elements of the Drosophila homeotic gene sex combs reduced,7498737,,"The homeotic gene Sex combs reduced (Scr) of Drosophila melanogaster is expressed in the labial and prothoracic segments of the ectoderm, in parasegments two and three of the CNS, and in the visceral mesoderm of the anterior and posterior midgut. The mutationally defined function of Scr is to specify the identity of the labial and prothoracic segments and to control the development of the gastric caeca. The Scr locus occupies a chromosomal region of approximately 80 kb within the Antennapedia complex (ANT-C). To understand how Scr's spatiotemporal expression pattern is generated in the embryo, we have mapped its transcriptional regulatory elements using three approaches. First, we examined the expression pattern of Scr in embryos containing chromosomal rearrangements that remove potential Scr regulatory elements. Second, we made and analyzed a set of Scr minigene transformants. Third, we analyzed a set of Scr-lacZ enhancer tester constructs. Using more sensitive anti-SCR antisera, we discovered that Scr is expressed in tissues that were not previously thought to accumulate SCR: a stripe of ectodermal cells in the parasegment 2 region of stage 5 embryos, the embryonic salivary glands, and the dorsal ridge. Four DNA fragments that had previously been shown in an analysis of Scr-lacZ reporter constructs to contain putative Scr enhancer elements were found to have functional enhancers; similarly, another Scr fragment was found to contain a functional repressor. Our results suggest that regulation of Scr in the labial segment and the CNS requires the apparently synergistic action of multiple, widely spaced enhancer elements. Regulation in the prothorax also appears to be controlled by multiple enhancers:one complete pattern element and one subpattern element. In contrast, Scr regulation in the visceral mesoderm is controlled by an enhancer(s) located in only one DNA fragment.",1995,"T C Kaufman, M J Gorman"
"Laminin is required for heart, somatic muscles, and gut development in the Drosophila embryo",7781902,10.1006/dbio.1995.1173,"Laminin, an extracellular matrix glycoprotein, has been implicated in a wide array of biological activities. Its specific roles during development, however, remain to be elucidated. In this report we describe the specific contribution of laminin to histogenesis and organogenesis during Drosophila embryogenesis. In particular, the function of laminin during mesoderm development and morphogenesis was dissected by analyzing embryos deficient in laminin A chain alone or in both laminin A and B2 chains. We show that laminin function is not required for the early phases of mesoderm patterning and morphogenesis in embryos at the extended germ band phase (stage 11). However, laminin function is required for the proper morphogenesis of the heart, somatic mesoderm, and the gut during later stages of embryonic development. In laminin A-deficient embryos, the heart is ""broken"" as a result of dissociation of the pericardial cells. The somatic myotubes are defective and do not extend properly, and the ventral oblique muscles never reach their proper attachment sites. Finally, during midgut formation, the endoderm fails to undergo the initial columnar polarization in the absence of functional laminin. These studies indicate that the primary function of laminin is to provide structural support for the various cell types, thereby enabling their proper organization into the various organs.",1995,"T Yarnitzky, T Volk"

The GLUT1 glucose transporter has an extensive 3' UTR that is AU-rich reminiscent of the 3'UTR of an oncogene mRNA. An in vitro RNA binding assay using Hel-N1 demonstrated binding to a specific portion of the GLUT1 3'UTR. Analysis of the folding pattern of this region depicted the retention of a stem loop structure, wherein the loop is composed of a stretch of uridylates. To further analyze the potential function of Hel-N1, stable transfectants were made in the 3T3-L1 cell line. The transfectants have been characterized, and the presence of the Hel-N1 DNA and protein verified.

The expression of additive and nonadditive genetic variation under stress,7672585,,"Experimental lines of Drosophila melanogaster derived from a natural population, which had been isolated in the laboratory for approximately 70 generations, were crossed to determine if the expression of additive, dominance and epistatic genetic variation in development time and viability was associated with the environment. No association was found between the level of additive genetic effects and environmental value for either trait, but nonadditive genetic effects increased at both extremes of the environmental range for development time. The expression of high levels of dominance and epistatic genetic variation at environmental extremes may be a general expectation for some traits. The disruption of the epistatic gene complexes in the parental lines resulted in hybrid breakdown toward faster development and there was some indication of hybrid breakdown toward higher viability. A combination of genetic drift and natural selection had therefore resulted in different epistatic gene complexes being selected after approximately 70 generations from a common genetic base. After crossing, the hybrid populations were observed for 10 generations. Epistasis contributed on average 12 hr in development time.

Considerable variation was seen in the evolutionary outcomes of competition among environments, and also among replicate populations within environments. Significant replicate-by-environment interactions were also observed.

"Functional reconstruction of trans regulation of the Ultrabithorax promoter by the products of two antagonistic genes, trithorax and Polycomb",8524225,10.1128/mcb.15.12.6601,"Maintenance of the ""on-off"" state of Drosophila homeotic genes in Antennapedia and bithorax complexes requires activities of the trithorax and Polycomb groups of genes. To identify cis-acting sequences for functional reconstruction of regulation by both trithorax and Polycomb, we examined the expression patterns of several Ubx-lacZ transgenes that carry upstream fragments corresponding to a region of approximately 50 kb. A 14.5-kb fragment from the postbithorax/bithoraxoid region of Ultrabithorax exhibited proper regulation by both trithorax and Polycomb in the embryonic central nervous system. Using a Drosophila haploid cell line for transient expression, we found that trithorax or Polycomb can function independently through this upstream fragment to activate or repress the Ultrabithorax promoter, respectively. Studies of deletion mutants of trithorax and Polycomb demonstrated that trithorax-dependent activation requires the central zinc-binding domain, while Polycomb-dependent repression requires the intact chromodomain. In addition, trithorax-dependent activity can be abrogated by increasing the amount of Polycomb, suggesting a competitive interaction between the products of trithorax and Polycomb. Deletion analysis of this fragment demonstrated that a 440-bp fragment contains response elements for both trithorax and Polycomb. Furthermore, we showed that the integrity of the proximal promoter region is essential for trithorax-dependent activation, implicating a long-range interaction for promoter activation.",1995,"B O King, M O'Connor, Y L Chang, A Mazo, D H Huang"
Dynamin self-assembles into rings suggesting a mechanism for coated vesicle budding,7877694,10.1038/374190a0,"DYNAMIN, a 100K member of the GTPase superfamily, is the mammalian homologue of the Drosophila shibire gene product. Mutations in shibire cause a defect in endocytosis leading to accumulation of coated pits and deep invaginations at the plasma membrane of all tissues examined. Similarly, invaginated coated pits accumulate in mammalian cells overexpressing dominant-negative mutants of dynamin, establishing that dynamin is required for the formation of 'constricted' coated pits and for coated vesicle budding. Whether dynamin functions in the classic GTPase mode as a molecular switch to regulate events leading to coated vesicle budding or instead actively participates as a mechanochemical enzyme driving coated vesicle formation is unclear. Here we show that dynamin spontaneously self-assembles into rings and stacks of interconnected rings, comparable in dimension to the 'collars' observed at the necks of invaginated coated pits that accumulate at synaptic terminals in shibire flies. We propose that invaginated coated pits become constricted by the assembly of dynamin into rings around their necks.

Specialized chromatin structure domain boundary elements flanking a Drosophila heat shock gene locus are under torsional strain in vivo,7873544,10.1021/bi00008a029,"An in vivo assay employing psoralen cross-linking was used to investigate the presence of unrestrained supercoiling in DNA sequences located in nontranscribed regions flanking the 3' ends of the pair of divergent heat shock protein 70 (hsp70) genes at locus 87A7 of Drosophila. Two of the regions examined contain sequences comprising the previously defined specialized chromatin structure elements (scs and scs'). Both of these putative chromosomal domain boundaries exhibited very similar levels of unrestrained negative supercoiling that remained high regardless of the transcriptional status of the hsp70 genes. The steric accessibility of the scs region before heat shock was 3-fold higher than either flanking region (consistent with its previously documented DNase I hypersensitivity); this increased an additional 2-fold following hsp70 gene activation without a concomitant rise in the accessibility of flanking regions. Most notably, a sequence which lies outside the presumed 87A7 domain, as defined by the centromere-proximal scs element, exhibited no detectable torsional tension regardless of gene activity in the domain. A sequence located just inside the scs region displayed a low level of tension that was also essentially unaffected by transcription, consistent with data obtained previously for a similarly situated fragment at the centromere-distal scs' location. The existence of a highly localized region of supercoiling within the scs and scs' sequences might be related to their activity in vivo as insulators of chromosomal position effects in Drosophila.",1995,"R R Sinden, E R Jupe, I L Cartwright"

RNA metabolism in situ at the 93D heat shock locus in polytene nuclei of Drosophila melanogaster after various treatments,7540096,10.1007/BF00710708,"Quantitative in situ hybridization to RNA on polytene chromosome spreads, using the 93D exon-, intron- and repeat-specific 35S-labeled antisense RNA probes, revealed treatment- (heat shock, benzamide, colchicine, heat shock followed by benzamide and heat shock in the presence of colchicine) specific differences in the metabolism (synthesis and/or accumulation at the puff site) of the various hsr-omega transcripts, namely hsr-omega-nuclear (omega-n), omega-pre-cytoplasmic (omega-pre-c) and omega-cytoplasmic (omega-c). While heat shock increased the levels of all the three transcripts at the 93D puff site in a coordinated manner, benzamide led to a significant increase in the levels of hsr-omega-n and pre-c; on the other hand, colchicine caused increased levels of the omega-n and omega-c RNA species at 93D. The results also suggested splicing of hsr-omega-pre-c RNA at the site of synthesis with the spliced-out 'free' intron (hsr-omega-fi) accumulating at the puff site. The rate of splicing and/or turnover of the hsr-omega-fi varied in a treatment-specific manner. Although a combined treatment to salivary glands with heat shock and benzamide or colchicine is known to inhibit puffing and [3H]uridine incorporation at 93D, the two treatments resulted in a treatment-specific increase in the in situ levels of different hsr-omega transcripts at the 93D site, suggesting a reduced turnover of specific transcripts from the site under these conditions.

Isofemale lines were established from flies collected along a transect extending from Winnipeg, Manitoba (Canada) to Tampa Bay, Florida (U.S.A.). Offspring from different lines within each location were then cultured under standardized conditions and used to examine phenotypic variation in seven morphological characters along the cline. In addition, allozyme variation at seven polymorphic loci was examined for the same set of clinal populations. Scutellum length and wing length show the strongest clinal trends. Clinal variation is nonmonotonic, with larger flies in the middle latitudes and smaller flies in the north and south. This result contrasts with other studies which have shown monotonic clines. Patterns of population subdivision were different for the different characters. This implies that there are different selective forces acting on the different morphological characters. Based on a comparison of morphological and molecular population subdivision for adjacent populations it is inferred that natural selection is operating to maintain a high level of population subdivision for wing width and the first principal component between one of the sets of populations.

Like the whole protein, which may perform an architectural role in chromatin, the individual boxes bind to DNA without sequence specificity, have a preference for distorted or prebent DNA, and are able to bend DNA and constrain negative superhelical turns. They show qualitatively similar properties with quantitative differences. We have previously determined the structure of the HMG box from the central B-domain (77 residues) by two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy, which showed that it contains a novel fold [Weir et al. (1993) EMBO J. 12, 1311-1319]. We have now determined the structure of the A-domain (as a Cys-->Ser mutant at position 22 to avoid oxidation, without effect on its DNA-binding properties or structure) using heteronuclear three- and four-dimensional NMR spectroscopy. The A-domain has a very similar global fold to the B-domain and the Drosophila protein HMG-D [Jones et al. (1994) Structure 2, 609-627]. There are small differences between A and B, in particular in the orientation of helix I, where the B-domain is more similar to HMG-D than it is to the A-domain; these differences may turn out to be related to the subtle differences in functional properties between the two domains [Teo et al. (1995) Eur. J. Biochem. 230, 943-950] and will be the subject of further investigation. NMR studies of the interaction of the A-domain of HMG1 with a short double-stranded oligonucleotide support the notion that the protein binds via the concave face of the L-shaped structure; extensive contacts with the DNA are made by the N-terminal extended strand, the N-terminus of helix I, and the C-terminus of helix II. These contacts are very similar to those seen in the LEF-1 and SRY-DNA complexes [Love et al. (1995) Nature 376, 791-795; Werner et al. (1995) Cell 81, 705-714].",1995,"A R Raine, E D Laue, J O Thomas, K D Grasser, C H Hardman, R W Broadhurst"
Genetic variation in the shape of cold-survival curves in a single fly population suggests potential for selection from climate variability,29345010,10.1111/jeb.13244,"Temperature variation is one of the primary challenges facing ectotherms, and the ability to tolerate a range of thermal environments is critical for setting current and future species distributions. Low temperature is particularly challenging for ectotherms because winter conditions have strong latitudinal and temporal variation. Lower lethal temperature (LLT) is a common metric of cold tolerance used in studies of local adaptation and plasticity. Comparisons of LLT across groups typically assume parallel S-shaped survival curves, but genetic variation in the shape of survival vs. temperature curves has not been assessed. Here, we measured the ability of 36 lines of the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) to survive a 1-h cold shock at seven ecologically relevant low temperatures (-1 to -7 °C) to create a high-resolution response curve for each genotype. We observed surprising variation both in the magnitude of survival and in the shapes of the response curves, with the curves clustering into four distinct shapes. To encompass variation in the shapes of these survival curves, we developed a new cold tolerance metric, cumulative cold tolerance (CCT). By comparing our survival data with climatological data, we propose that variation in the shapes of cold-survival curves arose from weak selection pressure to survive intermediate subzero temperatures in this mid-latitude population of flies. Using publicly available genome sequence and transcript expression data for these lines, we identified several candidate genes associated with CCT, and using transgenic RNAi, we confirmed a functional role for many of these genes.",2018,"D A Hahn, N M Teets"
Regulation of antimicrobial peptide genes via insulin-like signaling pathway in the silkworm Bombyx mori,30321587,10.1016/j.ibmb.2018.10.002,"Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are important effector molecules of insect humoral immunity, and expression of AMPs is mainly regulated by the Toll and immune deficiency (IMD) pathways. FoxO, a key downstream regulator of the insulin-like signaling (ILS) pathway, has been recently reported to be involved in the regulation of AMPs in Drosophila melanogaster. In the present study, we investigated AMP gene expression and the regulation pathway controlled by the starvation in the silkworm Bombyx mori. We discovered that antibacterial activity in the hemolymph of B. mori larvae was increased by starvation, and expression of AMP genes (BmCecB6, BmAtta1, BmLeb3 and BmDefB) as well as the ILS target genes (FoxO, InR and Brummer) were strongly activated in the fat body by starvation. Moreover, phosphorylation of Akt kinase was reduced in the Bm-12 cells after starvation, suggesting that the ILS pathway was inhibited by starvation. We then showed that more FoxO protein was present in the cytoplasm than in the nucleus of Bm-12 cells under normal conditions, but more FoxO was detected in the nucleus after cells were starved for 8 h, indicating that FoxO was activated by starvation. In summary, our results indicated that starvation can activate AMP gene expression in B. mori via the ILS/FoxO signaling pathway.",2018,"Junfeng Xu, Yangjin Zhong, Weike Yang, Xiao-Qiang Yu, Xiaojuan Deng, Jie Zhang, Qingrong Li, Yang Cao, Wanying Yang"
Quantification of Biogenic Amines from Individual GFP-Labeled Drosophila Cells by MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry,29873224,10.1021/acs.analchem.8b00961,"Cell-cell communication plays a crucial role in orchestrating and modulating neural circuits. To understand such interactions, it is vital to determine and quantify the involved messenger molecules such as neuropeptides and biogenic amines on the level of single cells. In this study, we used single-cell mass spectrometry (SCMS) to qualify and quantify octopamine (OA) and tyramine (TA) from isolated single cells from intact brains of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Our workflow involved targeted GFP-guided single-cell microdissection, on-plate chemical derivatization with 4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamaldehyde (CA) or 2,5-dimethyl-1 H-pyrrole-3,4-dicarbaldehyde (DPD) for increasing ion stability and ion signal intensity, and isotopically marked internal standards for quantification by MALDI-TOF MS. We were able to determine a limit of detection for OA of 1 fmol/μL, for TA of 2.5 fmol/μL and a lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of 10 fmol/μL for both substances. SCMS of GFP-labeled somata from ventral midline neurons of the labial neuromere (VMlb) of the gnathal ganglion revealed an OA titer of 17.38 fmol/μL and a TA titer (∼2.5 fmol/μL) lower than the LLOQ, independent of sex. However, using a genetically altered driver line devoid of OA, TßhnM18/Tdc2 > GFP, we confirmed TA in these cells. Furthermore, cold-anesthetization of flies caused a significant increase in OA content in VMlb somata. We compared OA titers of somata from two different OA/TA cell clusters to demonstrate the usefulness of targeted SCMS in advancing our understanding of OA/TA signaling in behavior and physiology. An influence on the detection of neuropeptides by our derivatized SCMS method could be excluded.",2018,"Susanne Neupert, Max Diesner"
Lineage-guided Notch-dependent gliogenesis by Drosophila multi-potent progenitors,29764857,10.1242/dev.160127,"Macroglial cells in the central nervous system exhibit regional specialization and carry out region-specific functions. Diverse glial cells arise from specific progenitors in specific spatiotemporal patterns. This raises an interesting possibility that glial precursors with distinct developmental fates exist that govern region-specific gliogenesis. Here, we have mapped the glial progeny produced by the Drosophila type II neuroblasts, which, like vertebrate radial glia cells, yield both neurons and glia via intermediate neural progenitors (INPs). Distinct type II neuroblasts produce different characteristic sets of glia. A single INP can make both astrocyte-like and ensheathing glia, which co-occupy a relatively restrictive subdomain. Blocking apoptosis uncovers further lineage distinctions in the specification, proliferation and survival of glial precursors. Both the switch from neurogenesis to gliogenesis and the subsequent glial expansion depend on Notch signaling. Taken together, lineage origins preconfigure the development of individual glial precursors with involvement of serial Notch actions in promoting gliogenesis.",2018,"Yu-Chun Wang, Yu-Fen Huang, Tzumin Lee, Takeshi Awasaki, Qingzhong Ren"
SSPIM: a beam shaping toolbox for structured selective plane illumination microscopy,29968787,10.1038/s41598-018-28389-8,"Selective plane illumination microscopy (SPIM) represents a preferred method in dynamic tissue imaging, because it combines high spatiotemporal resolution with low phototoxicity. The OpenSPIM system was developed to provide an accessible and flexible microscope set-up for non-specialist users. Here, we report Structured SPIM (SSPIM), which offers an open-source, user-friendly and compact toolbox for beam shaping to be applied within the OpenSPIM platform. SSPIM is able to generate digital patterns for a wide range of illumination beams including static and spherical Gaussian beams, Bessel beams and Airy beams by controlling the pattern of a Spatial Light Modulator (SLM). In addition, SSPIM can produce patterns for structured illumination including incoherent and coherent array beams and tiling for all types of the supported beams. We describe the workflow of the toolbox and demonstrate its application by comparing experimental data with simulation results for a wide range of illumination beams. Finally, the capability of SSPIM is investigated by 3D imaging of Drosophila embryos using scanned Gaussian, Bessel and array beams.

A postsynaptic PI3K-cII dependent signaling controller for presynaptic homeostatic plasticity,29303480,10.7554/eLife.31535,"Presynaptic homeostatic plasticity stabilizes information transfer at synaptic connections in organisms ranging from insect to human. By analogy with principles of engineering and control theory, the molecular implementation of PHP is thought to require postsynaptic signaling modules that encode homeostatic sensors, a set point, and a controller that regulates transsynaptic negative feedback. The molecular basis for these postsynaptic, homeostatic signaling elements remains unknown. Here, an electrophysiology-based screen of the Drosophila kinome and phosphatome defines a postsynaptic signaling platform that includes a required function for PI3K-cII, PI3K-cIII and the small GTPase Rab11 during the rapid and sustained expression of PHP. We present evidence that PI3K-cII localizes to Golgi-derived, clathrin-positive vesicles and is necessary to generate an endosomal pool of PI(3)P that recruits Rab11 to recycling endosomal membranes.

Role of Smad3 signaling in the epithelial‑mesenchymal transition of the lens epithelium following injury,29750298,10.3892/ijmm.2018.3662,"Transforming growth factor‑β (TGF‑β) is important in the development of posterior capsule opacification (PCO), and inhibition of the TGF‑β pathway may represent a novel method of treating PCO. Drosophila protein, mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 3 (Smad3) is a phosphorylated receptor‑activated Smad required for the transmission of TGF‑β signals. Smad3 knockout (KO) disturbs the activation of TGF‑β signaling, thus inhibiting the onset of PCO. In the present study, lens epithelial cell (LEC) damage induced by extracapsular cataract extraction was simulated by puncture of the anterior capsule using a 26‑gauge hypodermic needle. The effect of Smad3 in the trauma‑induced epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT) of the lens epithelium in Smad3‑KO and wild‑type (WT) mice was then observed. The expression levels of EMT markers and extracellular matrix components were measured in the two groups by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis, western blot analysis and immunofluorescence staining. Apoptosis was also detected in the punctured anterior capsule. The Smad3‑KO mice exhibited lower expression levels of α‑smooth muscle actin, lumican, osteopontin, fibronectin and collagen, compared with the WT mice. Additionally, the Smad3‑KO mice exhibited a higher percentage of apoptotic cells than the WT mice. Smad3 signaling was associated with the induction of trauma‑induced EMT, and Smad3 KO interfered with TGF‑β signaling pathway activation, but did not completely inhibit the trauma‑induced EMT in LECs. Therefore, Smad3 may be a target in the treatment of PCO and other fibrosis‑related diseases.",2018,"Xiao Yang, Fanlan Meng, Jun Li, Xin Tang, Xiaoyong Yuan"
Regulated Alternative Splicing of Drosophila Dscam2 Is Necessary for Attaining the Appropriate Number of Photoreceptor Synapses,29208630,10.1534/genetics.117.300432,"How the brain makes trillions of synaptic connections using a genome of only 20,000 genes is a major question in modern neuroscience. Alternative splicing is one mechanism that can increase the number of proteins produced by each gene, but its role in regulating synapse formation is poorly understood. In Drosophila, photoreceptors form a synapse with multiple postsynaptic elements including lamina neurons L1 and L2. L1 and L2 express distinct isoforms of the homophilic repulsive protein Dscam2, and since these isoforms cannot bind to each other, cell-specific expression has been proposed to be necessary for preventing repulsive interactions that could disrupt the synapse. Here, we show that the number of synapses are reduced in flies that express only one isoform, and L1 and L2 dendritic morphology is perturbed. We propose that these defects result from inappropriate interactions between L1 and L2 dendrites. We conclude that regulated Dscam2 alternative splicing is necessary for the proper assembly of photoreceptor synapses.",2018,"Joshua Shing Shun Li, S Sean Millard, Grace Ji-Eun Shin, Peter G Noakes, Sarah K Kerwin"
Nuclear Actin Is Required for Transcription during Drosophila Oogenesis,30384134,10.1016/j.isci.2018.10.010,"Actin has been linked to processes spanning the whole gene expression cascade, from regulating specific transcription factors, such as myocardin-related transcription factor, to chromatin remodeling and RNA polymerase function. However, whether actin controls the transcription of only specific genes or has a global role in gene expression has remained elusive. Our genome-wide analysis reveals, for the first time, that actin interacts with essentially all transcribed genes in Drosophila ovaries. Actin co-occupies the majority of gene promoters together with Pol II, and on highly expressed genes, these two proteins also associate with gene bodies. Mechanistically, actin is required for Pol II recruitment to gene bodies, and manipulation of nuclear transport factors for actin leads to the decreased expression of eggshell genes. Collectively, these results uncover a global role for actin in transcription and demonstrate the in vivo importance of balanced nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of actin in the transcriptional control of a developmental process.",2018,"Maria Sokolova, Maria K Vartiainen, Rita Cerejeira Matos, Ville Hietakangas, Minna Poukkula, Joseph Dopie, Mikko Honkanen, Bina Prajapati, Leena Meriläinen, Henna M Moore"

In the beetle Tribolium castaneum, double-stranded RNA is applied by simple injection and distributes systemically within the tissue. Thus, systematic testing for RNAi specificity and efficiency is easily possible in this organism. Generally, the use of non-overlapping dsRNA fragments yielding qualitatively identical phenotypes is the method of choice to verify target-specific knockdown effects. Here, we show that UTR-specific RNAi results in different effects regarding quality, severity and penetrance when compared to RNAi fragments directed at the coding region. Furthermore, when using 3'UTR-specific dsRNA, we first describe the Distal-lessRNAi antenna-to-leg transformation phenotype in the Tribolium larva, which has only been observed in the adult beetle and Drosophila so far. In addition, we unexpectedly observed sterility effects caused by 3'UTR-specific knockdown of the Tribolium-Sp8 orthologue that is not seen when dsRNA targeted a sequence within the coding-region or the 5'UTR that itself led to early embryonic lethality. We conclude that targeting UTR sequences by region-specific RNAi can reveal unexpected new aspects of gene function applicable in basic research and crop protection.",2018,"Susanne Thümecke, Reinhard Schröder"
Increasing autophagy and blocking Nrf2 suppress laminopathy-induced age-dependent cardiac dysfunction and shortened lifespan,29575479,10.1111/acel.12747,"Mutations in the human LMNA gene cause a collection of diseases known as laminopathies. These include myocardial diseases that exhibit age-dependent penetrance of dysrhythmias and heart failure. The LMNA gene encodes A-type lamins, intermediate filaments that support nuclear structure and organize the genome. Mechanisms by which mutant lamins cause age-dependent heart defects are not well understood. To address this issue, we modeled human disease-causing mutations in the Drosophila melanogaster Lamin C gene and expressed mutant Lamin C exclusively in the heart. This resulted in progressive cardiac dysfunction, loss of adipose tissue homeostasis, and a shortened adult lifespan. Within cardiac cells, mutant Lamin C aggregated in the cytoplasm, the CncC(Nrf2)/Keap1 redox sensing pathway was activated, mitochondria exhibited abnormal morphology, and the autophagy cargo receptor Ref2(P)/p62 was upregulated. Genetic analyses demonstrated that simultaneous over-expression of the autophagy kinase Atg1 gene and an RNAi against CncC eliminated the cytoplasmic protein aggregates, restored cardiac function, and lengthened lifespan. These data suggest that simultaneously increasing rates of autophagy and blocking the Nrf2/Keap1 pathway are a potential therapeutic strategy for cardiac laminopathies.",2018,"Mastaneh Nikravesh, Diane E Cryderman, Adriana S Trujillo, Grant H Young, Girish C Melkani, Lori L Wallrath, Sahaana Chandran, Maureen T O'Connor, Shruti Bhide"
Dynamic changes in ORC localization and replication fork progression during tissue differentiation,30134926,10.1186/s12864-018-4992-3,"Background: Genomic regions repressed for DNA replication, resulting in either delayed replication in S phase or underreplication in polyploid cells, are thought to be controlled by inhibition of replication origin activation. Studies in Drosophila polytene cells, however, raised the possibility that impeding replication fork progression also plays a major role. Results: We exploited genomic regions underreplicated (URs) with tissue specificity in Drosophila polytene cells to analyze mechanisms of replication repression. By localizing the Origin Recognition Complex (ORC) in the genome of the larval fat body and comparing this to ORC binding in the salivary gland, we found that sites of ORC binding show extensive tissue specificity. In contrast, there are common domains nearly devoid of ORC in the salivary gland and fat body that also have reduced density of ORC binding sites in diploid cells. Strikingly, domains lacking ORC can still be replicated in some polytene tissues, showing absence of ORC and origins is insufficient to repress replication. Analysis of the width and location of the URs with respect to ORC position indicates that whether or not a genomic region lacking ORC is replicated is controlled by whether replication forks formed outside the region are inhibited. Conclusions: These studies demonstrate that inhibition of replication fork progression can block replication across genomic regions that constitutively lack ORC. Replication fork progression can be inhibited in both tissue-specific and genome region-specific ways. Consequently, when evaluating sources of genome instability it is important to consider altered control of replication forks in response to differentiation.",2018,"Helena Kashevsky, Jessica R Von Stetina, Terry L Orr-Weaver, George W Bell, Brian L Hua"

The Timed Depolarization of Morning and Evening Oscillators Phase Shifts the Circadian Clock of Drosophila,27269519,10.1177/0748730416651363,"Phase response curves (PRCs) for light or temperature stimuli have been shown to be most valuable in understanding how circadian clocks are entrained to daily environmental cycles. Nowadays, PRC experiments in which clock neurons are manipulated in a temporally restricted manner by thermogenetic or optogenetic tools are also useful to comprehend clock network properties. Here, we temporally depolarized specific clock neurons of Drosophila melanogaster by activating temperature-sensitive dTrpA1 channels to unravel their role in phase shifting the flies' activity rhythm. The depolarization of all clock neurons caused a PRC resembling the flies' light PRC, with strong phase delays in the first half of the subjective night and modest phase advances in its second half. However, the activation of the flies' pigment-dispersing factor (PDF)-positive morning (M) neurons (s-LNvs) only induced phase advances, and these reached into the subjective day, where the light PRC has its dead zone. This indicates that the M neurons are very potent in accelerating the clock, which is in line with previous observations. In contrast, the evening (E) neurons together with the PDF-positive l-LNvs appear to mediate phase delays. Most interestingly, the molecular clock (Period protein cycling) of the depolarized clock neurons was shifted in parallel to the behavior, and this shift was already visible within the first cycle after the temperature pulse.

Human Senataxin Modulates Structural Plasticity of the Neuromuscular Junction in Drosophila through a Neuronally Conserved TGFβ Signalling Pathway,27197982,10.1159/000445435,"Background: Mutations in the human Senataxin (hSETX) gene have been shown to cause two forms of neurodegenerative disorders - a dominant form called amyotrophic lateral sclerosis type 4 (ALS4) and a recessive form called ataxia with oculomotor apraxia type 2 (AOA2). SETX is a putative DNA/RNA helicase involved in RNA metabolism. Although several dominant mutations linked with ALS4 have been identified in SETX, their contribution towards ALS4 pathophysiology is still elusive. Method: In order to model ALS4 in Drosophila and to elucidate the morphological, physiological and signalling consequences, we overexpressed the wild-type and pathological forms of hSETX in Drosophila. Results and conclusions: The pan-neuronal expression of wild-type or mutant forms of hSETX induced morphological plasticity at neuromuscular junction (NMJ) synapses. Surprisingly, we found that while the NMJ synapses were increased in number, the neuronal function was normal. Analysis of signalling pathways revealed that hSETX modulates the Highwire (Hiw; a conserved neuronal E3 ubiquitin ligase)-dependent bone morphogenetic protein/TGFβ pathway.

Misregulation of Gene Expression and Sterility in Interspecies Hybrids: Causal Links and Alternative Hypotheses,27025762,10.1007/s00239-016-9734-z,"Understanding the origin of species is of interest to biologist in general and evolutionary biologist in particular. Hybrid male sterility (HMS) has been a focus in studies of speciation because sterility imposes a barrier to free gene flow between organisms, thus effectively isolating them as distinct species. In this review, I focus on the role of differential gene expression in HMS and speciation. Microarray and qPCR assays have established associations between misregulation of gene expression and sterility in hybrids between closely related species. These studies originally proposed disrupted expression of spermatogenesis genes as a causative of sterility. Alternatively, rapid genetic divergence of regulatory elements, particularly as they relate to the male sex (fast-male evolution), can drive the misregulation of sperm developmental genes in the absence of sterility. The use of fertile hybrids (both backcross and F1 progeny) as controls has lent support to this alternative explanation. Differences in gene expression between fertile and sterile hybrids can also be influenced by a pattern of faster evolution of the sex chromosome (fast-X evolution) than autosomes. In particular, it would be desirable to establish whether known X-chromosome sterility factors can act as trans-regulatory drivers of genome-wide patterns of misregulation. Genome-wide expression studies coupled with assays of proxies of sterility in F1 and BC progeny have identified candidate HMS genes but functional assays, and a better phenotypic characterization of sterility phenotypes, are needed to rigorously test how these genes might contribute to HMS.",2016,Alberto Civetta
Gene Dosage Imbalance Contributes to Chromosomal Instability-Induced Tumorigenesis,26859353,10.1016/j.devcel.2016.01.008,"Chromosomal instability (CIN) is thought to be a source of mutability in cancer. However, CIN often results in aneuploidy, which compromises cell fitness. Here, we used the dosage compensation mechanism (DCM) of Drosophila to demonstrate that chromosome-wide gene dosage imbalance contributes to the deleterious effects of CIN-induced aneuploidy and its pro-tumorigenic action. We present evidence that resetting of the DCM counterbalances the damaging effects caused by CIN-induced changes in X chromosome number. Importantly, interfering with the DCM suffices to mimic the cellular effects of aneuploidy in terms of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, JNK-dependent cell death, and tumorigenesis upon apoptosis inhibition. We unveil a role of ROS in JNK activation and a variety of cellular and tissue-wide mechanisms that buffer the deleterious effects of CIN, including DNA-damage repair, activation of the p38 pathway, and cytokine induction to promote compensatory proliferation.

Sensory Conflict Disrupts Activity of the Drosophila Circadian Network,27829142,10.1016/j.celrep.2016.10.029,"Periodic changes in light and temperature synchronize the Drosophila circadian clock, but the question of how the fly brain integrates these two input pathways to set circadian time remains unanswered. We explore multisensory cue combination by testing the resilience of the circadian network to conflicting environmental inputs. We show that misaligned light and temperature cycles can lead to dramatic changes in the daily locomotor activities of wild-type flies during and after exposure to sensory conflict. This altered behavior is associated with a drastic reduction in the amplitude of PERIOD (PER) oscillations in brain clock neurons and desynchronization between light- and temperature-sensitive neuronal subgroups. The behavioral disruption depends heavily on the phase relationship between light and temperature signals. Our results represent a systematic quantification of multisensory integration in the Drosophila circadian system and lend further support to the view of the clock as a network of coupled oscillatory subunits.",2016,"Ralf Stanewsky, Peter Dayan, Ross E F Harper, Joerg T Albert"

Although the Gal4-UAS system has been extensively used in genetic studies in Drosophila, it had not been applied to genetic studies in vertebrates until the mid-2000s. This was mainly due to the lack of an efficient transgenesis tool in model vertebrates, such as the P-transposable element of Drosophila, that can create hundreds or thousands of transgene insertions in different loci on the genome and thereby enables the generation of transgenic lines expressing Gal4 in various tissues and cells via enhancer trapping. This situation was revolutionized when a highly efficient transgenesis method using the Tol2 transposable element was developed in the model vertebrate zebrafish. By using the Tol2 transposon system, we and other labs successfully performed gene trap and enhancer trap screens in combination with the Gal4-UAS system. To date, numerous transgenic fish lines that express engineered versions of Gal4 in specific cells, organs, and tissues have been generated and used for various aspects of biological studies. By constructing transgenic fish lines harboring genes of interest downstream of UAS, the Gal4-expressing cells and tissues in those transgenic fish have been visualized and manipulated via the Gal4-UAS system.

Results: We found that the most critical considerations for the analysis of RNA-Seq read count data were the normalization method, underlying data distribution assumption, and numbers of biological replicates, an observation consistent with previous RNA-Seq and microarray analysis comparisons. Some common normalization methods, such as Total Count, Quantile, and RPKM normalization, did not align the data across samples. Furthermore, analyses using the Median, Quantile, and Trimmed Mean of M-values normalization methods were sensitive to the removal of low-expressed genes from the data set. Although it is robust in many types of analysis, the normal data distribution assumption produced results vastly different than the negative binomial distribution. In addition, at least three biological replicates per condition were required in order to have sufficient statistical power to detect expression differences among the three-way interaction of genotype, environment, and sex. Conclusions: The best analysis approach to our data was to normalize the read counts using the DESeq method and apply a generalized linear model assuming a negative binomial distribution using either edgeR or DESeq software. Genes having very low read counts were removed after normalizing the data and fitting it to the negative binomial distribution. We describe the results of this evaluation and include recommended analysis strategies for RNA-Seq read count data.",2016,"Susan T Harbison, Hang Noh Lee, Kseniya Golovnina, Hina Sultana, Yazmin L Serrano Negron, Yanzhu Lin, Brian Oliver, Zhen-Xia Chen"
Simvastatin ameliorates ventricular remodeling via the TGF‑β1 signaling pathway in rats following myocardial infarction,27121011,10.3892/mmr.2016.5178,"Statins are widely used in patients with cardiovascular diseases. A considerable number of previous studies revealed that the intracellular signaling of transforming growth factor (TGF)‑β1 mediated the development of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis. However, whether statins can ameliorate ventricular remodeling in post‑myocardial infarction via the TGF‑β1 signaling pathway remains to be rigorously tested. The left anterior descending artery was ligated to induce a rat model of myocardial infarction. The rat model of myocardial infarction was treated with simvastatin through gastric gavage (10, 20 or 40 mg kg‑1·d‑1). All rats were sacrificed on day 28 after the myocardial infarction operation. The results revealed that simvastatin significantly improved the hemodynamic indexes, left ventricular mass index, the myocardial tissue structure, the cardiomyocyte cross‑sectional area and the collagen volume fraction, and also showed that the levels of TGF‑β1, TGF‑activated kinase (TAK)1 and drosophila mothers against decapentaplegic (Smad)3 were significantly reduced following treatment with simvastatin, while the levels of Smad7 in the simvastatin treatment groups were markedly increased. The results of the present study suggested that statins ameliorated ventricular remodeling in post‑myocardial infarction rats via the TGF‑β1 signaling pathway, which provided a novel explanation for the pleiotropic effects of statins that benefit the cardiovascular system.",2016,"Xiangbin Xiao, Guanglei Chang, Dongying Zhang, Li Liu, Guangyun Sun, Jian Liu, Shu Qin"

Minibrain drives the Dacapo-dependent cell cycle exit of neurons in the Drosophila brain by promoting asense and prospero expression,27510975,10.1242/dev.134338,"A key aim of neurodevelopmental research is to understand how precursor cells decide to stop dividing and commence their terminal differentiation at the correct time and place. Here, we show that minibrain (mnb), the Drosophila ortholog of the Down syndrome candidate gene DYRK1A, is transiently expressed in newborn neuronal precursors known as ganglion cells (GCs). Mnb promotes the cell cycle exit of GCs through a dual mechanism that regulates the expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Dacapo, the homolog of vertebrate p27(Kip1) (Cdkn1b). Mnb upregulates the expression of the proneural transcription factor (TF) Asense, which promotes Dacapo expression. Mnb also induces the expression of Prospero, a homeodomain TF that in turn inhibits the expression of Deadpan, a pan-neural TF that represses dacapo In addition to its effects on Asense and Prospero, Mnb also promotes the expression of the neuronal-specific RNA regulator Elav, strongly suggesting that Mnb facilitates neuronal differentiation. These actions of Mnb ensure the precise timing of neuronal birth, coupling the mechanisms that regulate neurogenesis, cell cycle control and terminal differentiation of neurons.",2016,"Barbara Hämmerle, Julian Ceron, Francisco J Tejedor, Jordi Colonques, Mirja N Shaikh, Francisco Gutierrez-Aviño"
Evolution of transgenerational immunity in invertebrates,27683366,10.1098/rspb.2016.1136,"Over a decade ago, the discovery of transgenerational immunity in invertebrates shifted existing paradigms on the lack of sophistication of their immune system. Nonetheless, the prevalence of this trait and the ecological factors driving its evolution in invertebrates remain poorly understood. Here, we develop a theoretical host-parasite model and predict that long lifespan and low dispersal should promote the evolution of transgenerational immunity. We also predict that in species that produce both philopatric and dispersing individuals, it may pay to have a plastic allocation strategy with a higher transgenerational immunity investment in philopatric offspring because they are more likely to encounter locally adapted pathogens. We review all experimental studies published to date, comprising 21 invertebrate species in nine different orders, and we show that, as expected, longevity and dispersal correlate with the transfer of immunity to offspring. The validity of our prediction regarding the plasticity of investment in transgenerational immunity remains to be tested in invertebrates, but also in vertebrate species. We discuss the implications of our work for the study of the evolution of immunity, and we suggest further avenues of research to expand our knowledge of the impact of transgenerational immune protection in host-parasite interactions.",2016,"S Gandon, R Garnier, A Rivero, R Pigeault"
Phospho-Pon Binding-Mediated Fine-Tuning of Plk1 Activity,27238966,10.1016/j.str.2016.04.012,"In Drosophila neuroblasts (NBs), the asymmetrical localization and segregation of the cell-fate determinant Numb are regulated by its adaptor Partner of Numb (Pon) and the cell-cycle kinase Polo. Polo phosphorylates the Pon localization domain, thus leading to its basal distribution together with Numb, albeit through an unclear mechanism. Here, we find that Cdk1 phosphorylates Pon at Thr63, thus creating a docking site for the Polo-box domain (PBD) of Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1). The crystal structure of the Plk1 PBD/phospho-Pon complex reveals that two phospho-Pon bound PBDs associate to form a dimer of dimers. We provide evidence that phospho-Pon binding-induced PBD dimerization relieves the autoinhibition of Plk1. Moreover, we demonstrate that the priming Cdk1 phosphorylation of Pon is important for sequential Plk1 phosphorylation. Our results not only provide structural insight into how phosphoprotein binding activates Plk1 but also suggest that binding to different phosphoproteins might mediate the fine-tuning of Plk1 activity.",2016,"Zelin Shan, Kang Zhu, Wenyu Wen, Lu Zhang"
"Architectural proteins Pita, Zw5,and ZIPIC contain homodimerization domain and support specific long-range interactions in Drosophila",27137890,10.1093/nar/gkw371,"According to recent models, as yet poorly studied architectural proteins appear to be required for local regulation of enhancer-promoter interactions, as well as for global chromosome organization. Transcription factors ZIPIC, Pita and Zw5 belong to the class of chromatin insulator proteins and preferentially bind to promoters near the TSS and extensively colocalize with cohesin and condensin complexes. ZIPIC, Pita and Zw5 are structurally similar in containing the N-terminal zinc finger-associated domain (ZAD) and different numbers of C2H2-type zinc fingers at the C-terminus. Here we have shown that the ZAD domains of ZIPIC, Pita and Zw5 form homodimers. In Drosophila transgenic lines, these proteins are able to support long-distance interaction between GAL4 activator and the reporter gene promoter. However, no functional interaction between binding sites for different proteins has been revealed, suggesting that such interactions are highly specific. ZIPIC facilitates long-distance stimulation of the reporter gene by GAL4 activator in yeast model system. Many of the genomic binding sites of ZIPIC, Pita and Zw5 are located at the boundaries of topologically associated domains (TADs).

Factors involved in cardiogenesis and the regulation of cardiac-specific gene expression,8925567,10.1161/01.res.79.1.4,"The delineation of the mechanisms that regulate cardiac gene expression is central to our understanding of cardiac growth and development. Much progress has been made toward the identification of factors involved in tissue-restricted gene expression, especially in skeletal muscle cells. However, the mechanisms regulating the expression of cardiac-specific genes remain less well understood. Certain homeodomain proteins have been implicated in commitment to the cardiac phenotype. Among the best characterized are the murine proteins Csx, Nkx-2.5, and Nkx-2.6, related to the protein tinman, which is essential for heart formation in Drosophila. The expression of these genes precedes that of cardiac-specific genes and is therefore believed to play a critical role in the development of the heart. The GATA proteins are a family of zinc finger proteins that are also expressed early in cardiac development and may act separately from, or in concert with, the homeodomain proteins as crucial regulators of heart development. The myosin heavy and light chain genes, the actin genes, the troponin genes, and the atrial natriuretic factor and muscle creatine kinase genes have served as excellent paradigms for the study of cardiac gene expression. Although differences in cis-acting elements and their behavior in binding assays have been observed between different genes, there exist similarities that are noteworthy. In this review, we will discuss the factors involved in the regulation of cardiac-specific gene expression in an attempt to provide a better understanding of the process of cardiogenesis.",1996,"C C Liew, J D Mably"
A frizzled homolog functions in a vertebrate Wnt signaling pathway,8939578,10.1016/s0960-9822(02)70716-1,"Background: Wnts are secreted proteins implicated in cell-cell interactions during embryogenesis and tumorigenesis, but receptors involved in transducing Wnt signals have not yet been definitively identified. Members of a large family of putative transmembrane receptors homologous to the frizzled protein in Drosophila have been identified recently in both vertebrates and invertebrates, raising the question of whether they are involved in transducing signals for any known signaling factors. Results: To test the potential involvement of frizzled homologs in Wnt signaling, we examined the effects of overexpressing rat frizzled-1 (Rfz-1) on the subcellular distribution of Wnts and of dishevelled, a cytoplasmic component of the Wnt signalling pathway. We demonstrate that ectopic expression of Rfz-1 recruits the dishevelled proten-as well as Xenopus Wnt-8 (Xwnt-8), but not the functionally distinct Xwnt-5A-to the plasma membrane. Moreover, Rfz-1 is sufficient to induce the expression of two Xwnt-8-responsive genes, siamois and Xnr-3, in Xenopus explants in a manner which is antagonized by glycogen synthase kinase-3, which also antagonizes Wnt signaling. When Rfz-1 and Xwnt-8 are expressed together in this assay, we observe greater induction of these genes, indicating that Rfz-1 can synergize with a Wnt. Conclusions: The results demonstrate that a vertebrate frizzled homolog is involved in Wnt signaling in a manner which discriminates between functionally distinct Wnts, which involves translocation of the dishevelled protein to the plasma membrane, and which works in a synergistic manner with Wnts to induce gene expression. These data support the likely function of frizzled homologs as Wnt receptors, or as components of a receptor complex.",1996,"R T Moon, J R Miller, J D Brown, C J Lai, J Yang-Snyder"
Expression of the D-MEF2 transcription in the Drosophila brain suggests a role in neuronal cell differentiation,8622904,,"D-MEF2 is a MADS domain transcription factor expressed in the cardiac, somatic, and visceral muscle cell lineages in the Drosophila embryo. Genetic studies have demonstrated that D-mef2 gene function is required for the proper differentiation of all three of these muscle types. We show that D-MEF2 is also expressed in a limited number of other cells types during development, including Kenyon cells present in the mushroom bodies of the Drosophila brain. This finding suggests a role for D-mef2 in neuron differentiation. To investigate D-mef2 expression in muscle and Kenyon cells, we assayed 26 kb of D-mef2 5'-flanking and intragenic DNA for regulatory sequences controlling the expression of the gene. Our results show that separable enhancer sequences direct D-mef2 gene expression in the myogenic and neuronal cell lineages. The identification of these regulatory DNAs provides a starting point for the analysis of transcriptional regulators controlling the cell-specific expression of D-mef2 and a means to address the function of D-mef2 in Kenyon cell differentiation.",1996,"E N Olson, C Chromey, M F Lu, B Zhao, R A Schulz"
eat-5 and unc-7 represent a multigene family in Caenorhabditis elegans involved in cell-cell coupling,8707836,10.1083/jcb.134.2.537,"The Drosophila melanogaster genes Passover and l(1)ogre and the Caenorhabditis elegans gene unc-7 define a gene family whose function is not known. We have isolated and characterized the C. elegans gene eat-5, which is required for synchronized pharyngeal muscle contractions, and find that it is a new member of this family. Simultaneous electrical and video recordings reveal that in eat-5 mutants, action potentials of muscles in the anterior and posterior pharynx are unsynchronized. Injection of carboxyfluorescein into muscles of the posterior pharynx demonstrates that all pharyngeal muscles are dye-coupled in wild-type animals; in eat-5 mutants, however, muscles of the anterior pharynx are no longer dye-coupled to posterior pharyngeal muscles. We show that a gene fusion of eat-5 to the green fluorescent protein is expressed in pharyngeal muscles. unc-7 and eat-5 are two of at least sixteen members of this family in C. elegans as determined by database searches and PCR-based screens. The amino acid sequences of five of these members in C. elegans have been deduced from cDNA sequences. Polypeptides of the family are predicted to have four transmembrane domains with cytoplasmic amino and carboxyl termini. We have constructed fusions of one of these polypeptides with beta-galactosidase and with green fluorescent protein. The fusion proteins appear to be localized in a punctate pattern at or near plasma membranes.

The nature of quantitative genetic variation revisited: lessons from Drosophila bristles,8851044,10.1002/bies.950180207,"Most characters that distinguish one individual from another, like height or weight, vary continuously in populations. Continuous variation of these 'quantitative' traits is due to the simultaneous segregation of multiple quantitative trait loci (QTLs) as well as environmental influences. A major challenge in human medicine, animal and plant breeding and evolutionary genetics is to identify QTLs and determine their genetic properties. Studies of the classic quantitative traits, abdominal and sternopleural bristle numbers of Drosophila, have shown that: (1) many loci have small effects on bristle number, but a few have large effects and cause most of the genetic variation; (2) 'candidate' loci involved in bristle development often have large quantitative effects on bristle number; and (3) alleles at QTLs affecting bristle number have variable degrees of dominance, interact with each other, and affect other quantitative traits, including fitness. Lessons learned from this model system will be applicable to studies of the genetic basis of quantitative variation in other species.",1996,T F Mackay
"Pointed, an ETS domain transcription factor, negatively regulates the EGF receptor pathway in Drosophila oogenesis",9012496,,"Spatially regulated activation of the Drosophila epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor by its ligand, Gurken, is required for establishment of the dorsal/ventral axis of the oocyte and embryo. During mid-oogenesis, Gurken is concentrated at the dorsal-anterior of the oocyte and is thought to activate the EGF receptor pathway in adjacent follicle cells. In response to this signal, dorsal follicle cell fate is determined. These cells further differentiate into either appendage-producing or midline cells, resulting in patterning in the dorsal follicle cell layer. We show here that Pointed, an ETS transcription factor, is required in dorsal follicle cells for this patterning. Loss of pointed results in the loss of midline cells and an excess of appendage-forming cells, a phenotype associated with overactivation of the EGF receptor pathway in the dorsal region. Overexpression of pointed leads to a phenotype similar to that generated by loss of the EGF receptor pathway. This suggests that Pointed normally down-regulates EGF receptor signaling in the midline to generate patterning in the dorsal region. Interestingly, pointed expression is induced by the EGF receptor pathway. These data indicate a novel antagonistic function for Pointed in oogenesis; in response to activation of the EGF receptor, pointed is expressed and negatively regulates the EGF receptor pathway, possibly by integrating information from a second pathway.",1996,"A M Morimoto, K Tietze, E M O'Neill, J S Britton, H Ruohola-Baker, K C Jordan"
High density of an SAR-associated motif differentiates heterochromatin from euchromatin,8977875,10.1006/jtbi.1996.0209,"Heterochromatin is an important component of eukaryotic chromosomes, comprising a significant portion of the total DNA in genomes. Despite its prevalence, long-standing cytological descriptions, and predominant composition of tandemly repeated DNA, no general theory unites heterochromatic with its functions. In an attempt to identify heterochromatic sequence tags, we have analysed heterochromatic sequences from Drosophila melanogaster for the presence of motifs that are known to define regions that anchor the chromosomal DNA to the scaffold (scaffold attachment regions or SARs). The SARs of Drosophila melanogaster are characterized by the presence of a small conserved sequence (the A-box) that is clustered in overall A + T-rich regions. In comparing heterochromatic and euchromatic sequences we find that heterochromatic regions are several-fold enriched for these operationally defined SARs. This high density of SAR-associated sequences not only serves as a molecular tag for heterochromatin but also suggests a hypothesis for its special properties.",1996,"L D Strausbaugh, S M Williams"

They are organized around a transmembrane cadherin, which binds a set of cytoplasmic proteins required for adhesion and to link the complex to the actin cytoskeleton.

We carried out the first analysis of the interactions between these proteins using in vitro binding assays, the yeast two-hybrid system, and in vivo assays. We identified a 76-amino acid region of Armadillo that is necessary and sufficient for binding alpha-catenin and found that the N-terminal 258 amino acids of alpha-catenin interact with Armadillo. A large region of Armadillo, spanning six central Armadillo repeats, is required for DE-cadherin binding, whereas only 41 amino acids of the DE-cadherin cytoplasmic tail are sufficient for Armadillo binding.

Complete DNA sequence of the mitochondrial genome of Cepaea nemoralis (Gastropoda: Pulmonata),8919868,10.1007/BF02198842,"The nucleotide sequence of a mitochondrial genome of the pulmonate gastropod mollusc Cepaea nemoralis has been determined. Contained within the 14,100 basepairs (bp) are the two ribosomal RNA genes and 13 protein coding genes typical of metazoan mitochondrial genomes. The Cepaea mtDNA does contain a gene for ATPase subunit 8, like the clausiliid pulmonate, Albinaria, and the chiton, Katharina, but unlike the bivalve mollusc, Mytilus. The mitochondrial genetic code of Cepaea is proposed to be the same as that of Mytilus, Katharina, and Drosophila. Only 14 putative tRNA genes are presented, although there is sufficient unassigned sequence to encode the remainder of the expected total of 22 tRNA genes. These 14 tRNA genes are a mixture of standard cloverleaf structures and nonstandard structures containing TV replacement loops as seen in nematode and mosquito mitochondrial genomes. If the eight unidentified tRNA genes are indeed present, very little unassigned sequence would remain to serve as a control region. Genes are transcribed from both strands of the molecule. Base composition is the least biased for any reported animal mitochondrial genome and is also very little skewed between strands using measures independent of base composition. The Cepaea mitochondrial gene order is quite unlike that of any other reported metazoan mtDNA, with the exception of the recently reported partial sequences of Albinaria.

In the developing wing blade, somatic clones lacking the Dpp receptors Punt or Thick veins (Tkv), or lacking Schnurri, a transcription factor involved in Dpp signal interpretation, fail to grow when induced early in larval development. Furthermore the spatial requirement for these signaling components indicates that Dpp has to travel several cell diameters from its source in order to reach all cells that require its signal. The requirement for Tkv also depends on the distance of cells from the source of the Dpp signal.

Msx3: a novel murine homologue of the Drosophila msh homeobox gene restricted to the dorsal embryonic central nervous system,8887328,10.1016/s0925-4773(96)00562-x,"We have isolated Msx3, the third member of the murine Msx homeobox gene family which is homologous to the msh gene of Drosophila. The Msx3 cDNA encodes a protein of 204 amino acids which has striking regions of homology in addition to the homeodomain when compared to the other Msx family members. Msx3 maps to the distal end of mouse chromosome 7, thus it is unlinked to either Msx1 or Msx2. RNA in situ analysis of Msx3 gene expression during early development revealed that it is restricted to the dorsal portion of the neural tube with a rostral boundary in the rostral rhombencephalon. This sole expression domain for Msx3 overlaps with both Msx1 and Msx2 at early stages, but in older embryos, Msx3 expression becomes restricted to the ventricular zone of the dorsal neural tube, whereas Msx1 and Msx2 become localized to the non-neuronal roof plate region. The absence of detectable levels of Msx3 expression outside this restricted dorsal region of the developing central nervous system (CNS) is in marked contrast to Msx1 and Msx2, which have extensive expression domains in other embryonic tissues, particularly craniofacial structures and the limbs. By analogy with the expression of msh/Msx genes in other organisms, it is likely that one of the ancestral functions of the msh/Msx gene family is in patterning of the CNS.",1996,"X Chen, H Xu, W Wang, T Lufkin"

The intron-exon arrangement of gene 1 reflected evolutionary expansion of tropomyosin via 42- and 49-residue duplications, which are probably actin-binding domains.

Multiple sequence-specific transcription factors have been detected that bind to essential cis control elements located upstream and downstream of the Ubx mRNA cap site. The activity of some of these transcription factors varies during embryogenesis, and some are detected in embryonic extracts but not in Drosophila tissue culture cells. One factor, which binds to multiple GAGA DNA sequence motifs in the Ubx promoter, has been purified and shown to activate transcription from this promoter in a binding site-dependent manner. This in vitro analysis should help in understanding how Ubx expression is regulated and provide insight into the processes determining cellular fates during development.",1988,"R Tjian, M D Biggin"
The influence of whole-arm trisomy on gene expression in Drosophila,8608935,,"The biochemical consequences of extensive aneuploidy in Drosophila have been examined by measuring the levels of specific proteins in larvae trisomic for entire chromosome arms. By far the most common effect is a reduction in gene product levels (per gene template) by one-third from the diploid quantity, consistent with the model that concentration-dependent repressors of these loci reside on the duplicated chromosome arms. Most loci appear sensitive to such repression in one or more of the trisomies examined, suggesting that such regulatory loci might be quite common. Repression of gene-product levels in trisomies may significantly contribute to their inviability. Few loci are activated in trisomies implying that most factors necessary for gene expression are in excess. While autosomal trisomies can repress the expression of both X-linked and autosomal loci, X-chromosomal trisomies have little effect on most autosomal genes. A family of genes coding for larval serum proteins do not respond similarly in trisomies, suggesting that regulation operates on a process which is not common to their coordinate regulation. Finally, Adh genes transposed to new chromosomal positions maintain their ability to be repressed in 3L trisomies suggesting that this response to regulation involves a closely linked cis-acting regulatory element.",1988,"R H Devlin, D G Holm, T A Grigliatti"
"Analysis of mutants in chaoptin, a photoreceptor cell-specific glycoprotein in Drosophila, reveals its role in cellular morphogenesis",2449286,10.1016/0092-8674(88)90517-x,"Monoclonal antibody 24B10 (MAb24B10) specifically stains photoreceptor neurons in D. melanogaster. It recognizes a 160 kd glycoprotein localized to the extracellular face of the plasma membrane. Using an immunoscreen, we identified two mutations in the encoding gene that cause microvillar disorganization in developing rhabdomeres and disruption of the closely apposed membranes of adjacent cells. In accordance with the mutant phenotype, we have renamed this genetic locus chaoptic and the encoded glycoprotein, chaoptin. Immunoelectron microscopy indicates that chaoptin is distributed along the length of the microvillus. This localization and the morphological abnormalities in mutants support the hypothesis that chaoptin may mediate adhesion between closely apposed membranes. In principle, the immunoscreen utilized here can be used to identify mutations in any gene in Drosophila for which antibodies to the gene product are available.",1988,"D Van Vactor Jr, S L Zipursky, D E Krantz, R Reinke"
Cloning of a gene encoding an antigen associated with the centrosome in Drosophila,3143740,,"The monoclonal antibody Bx63 recognizes a centrosomal antigen of Drosophila melanogaster by indirect immunofluorescence and identifies two proteins, with apparent molecular weights of 185 x 10(3) and 66 x 10(3), on Western blots. We have used this antibody to isolate five clones (lambda cs1, -2, -3, -4 and lambda j63) from lambda gt11 expression libraries of Drosophila DNA. Using polyclonal anti-centrosomal sera raised against both immunoaffinity-purified Bx63 antigen and electrophoretically purified fusion protein from clone lambda cs3, we have demonstrated that the fusion proteins encoded by four of these clones (lambda cs1-4) share at least two epitopes with the 185 x 10(3) Mr centrosomal antigen. This indicates that clones lambda cs1-4 contain DNA from the gene coding for this protein. The four clones are independent isolates from a single chromosomal site, which we show by in situ hybridization to correspond with salivary gland chromosome region 88E 4-8. A low-abundance transcript of approximately 4.0 x 10(3) bases corresponding to the cloned gene is detected in all stages of the Drosophila life-cycle.",1988,"W G Whitfield, H Saumweber, D M Glover, S E Millar, M Frasch"
"Alpha-anomeric DNA: beta-RNA hybrids as new synthetic inhibitors of Escherichia coli RNase H, Drosophila embryo RNase H and M-MLV reverse transcriptase",2468572,10.1016/0378-1119(88)90162-x,"Nuclease-resistant alpha-anomeric DNA:beta-RNA hybrids are inhibitors of Escherichia coli RNase H, and Drosophila embryo RNase H. RNase H activities were measured by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, employing a short substrate, (A)12:d[G-G-(T)12-G-G], or by acid-solubility techniques, using a long substrate, poly(A):poly(dT). Strand exchanges which could be responsible for the observed inhibition have been ruled out by S1 nuclease experiments and by using inhibitors which do not allow strand exchange. Our results suggest that RNase H, for which DNA:RNA duplexes are the natural substrates, binds to non-physiological alpha-DNA:RNA hybrids and is consequently inhibited. These hybrids also inhibit the RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity of M-MLV reverse transcriptase, therefore appearing as potential inhibitors of at least two reverse transcriptase activities. However, the inhibitory effect of these hybrids with respect to M-MLV reverse transcriptase is also observed with the single-stranded alpha-DNA itself. Unexpectedly, polymerase activity is highly stimulated by alpha-oligos, analogous in their sequence to the beta primer used at a concentration unable to generate a detectable synthesis. These results suggest that the inhibition of reverse transcriptase activity with the alpha:beta may occur at different levels.",1988,"C Paoletti, J R Bertrand, M Lavignon, F Pognan, J L Imbach, C Malvy, B Rayner, F Morvan, E Bloch"
Interaction between a picornavirus and a wild population ofDrosophila melanogaster,28312425,10.1007/BF00776414,"Drosophila C virus (DCV) has a considerable impact on ovarian morphogenesis inDrosophila melanogaster host populations. This virus also affects the developmental time and the fresh weight of infected females. In order to investigate the hypothesis that DCV may play a role in the dynamics ofDrosophila populations, the fertility and embryonic and larvo-pupal death rates of a host population and that of five DCV-free populations were determined. A comparison of two populations, one of them DCV-free, the other infected, suggested that the fertility of the DCV-infected flies was higher than that of uninfected flies, despite a greater larvo-pupal death rate. Fertility of the infected flies was greater among the infected population than for the DCV-free populations. The DCV-free populations originated from five different localities. The virus clearly does have an impact on the biotic potential of its host population. This paper reports for the first time a positive interaction between a viral population and a host population as it increases certain parameters of host population dynamics.",1988,Michèle Thomas-Orillard
Contrast sensitivity and visual acuity of Queensland fruit flies (Bactrocera tryoni),32016552,10.1007/s00359-020-01404-y,"This study examines the visual acuity of Queensland fruit flies (Bactrocera tryoni) by analysing their turning responses to an immersive visual stimulus consisting of a pattern of vertical stripes presented at various angular periods and rotational rates. The results infer that these flies possess an interommatidial angle of approximately [Formula: see text], and an ommatidial acceptance angle of approximately [Formula: see text]. This suggests that the visual acuity of Queensland fruit flies is substantially better than that of the classical vinegar fly (Drosophila melanogaster), and is comparable to those of the housefly (Musca domestica) and the honeybee (Apis mellifera). The contrast sensitivity of Queensland fruit flies is comparable to that of the housefly.",2020,"Kiaran K K Lawson, Mandyam V Srinivasan"
The exon junction complex is required for stem and progenitor cell maintenance in planarians,31557470,10.1016/j.ydbio.2019.09.010,"Named for its assembly near exon-exon junctions during pre-mRNA splicing, the exon junction complex (EJC) regulates multiple aspects of RNA biochemistry, including export of spliced mRNAs from the nucleus and translation. Transcriptome analyses have revealed broad EJC occupancy of spliced metazoan transcripts, yet inhibition of core subunits has been linked to surprisingly specific phenotypes and a growing number of studies support gene-specific regulatory roles. Here we report results from a classroom-based RNAi screen revealing the EJC is necessary for regeneration in the planarian flatworm Schmidtea mediterranea. RNAi animals rapidly lost the stem and progenitor cells that drive formation of new tissue during both regeneration and cell turnover, but exhibited normal amputation-induced changes in gene expression in differentiated tissues. Together with previous reports that partial loss of EJC function causes stem cell defects in Drosophila and mice, our observations implicate the EJC as a conserved, posttranscriptional regulator of gene expression in stem cell lineages. This work also highlights the combined educational and scientific impacts of discovery-based research in the undergraduate biology curriculum.",2020,"John Dustin, Vanessa Poirier, Casey Kimball, Kaleigh Powers, Jason Pellettieri"
Mechanism underlying starvation-dependent modulation of olfactory behavior in Drosophila larva,32080342,10.1038/s41598-020-60098-z,"Starvation enhances olfactory sensitivity that encourage animals to search for food. The molecular mechanisms that enable sensory neurons to remain flexible and adapt to a particular internal state remain poorly understood. Here, we study the roles of GABA and insulin signaling in starvation-dependent modulation of olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) function in the Drosophila larva. We show that GABAB-receptor and insulin-receptor play important roles during OSN modulation. Using an OSN-specific gene expression analysis, we explore downstream targets of insulin signaling in OSNs. Our results suggest that insulin and GABA signaling pathways interact within OSNs and modulate OSN function by impacting olfactory information processing. We further show that manipulating these signaling pathways specifically in the OSNs impact larval feeding behavior and its body weight. These results challenge the prevailing model of OSN modulation and highlight opportunities to better understand OSN modulation mechanisms and their relationship to animal physiology.",2020,"Roshni Jain, Brianna Dailey-Krempel, Dennis Mathew, Sai Kollala, Seth R Odell, Dominique Baria, Eryn Slankster"
Experimental evidence for accelerated adaptation to desiccation through sexual selection on males,32315476,10.1111/jeb.13634,"The impact of sexual selection on the adaptive process remains unclear. On the one hand, sexual selection might hinder adaptation by favouring costly traits and preferences that reduce nonsexual fitness. On the other hand, condition dependence of success in sexual selection may accelerate adaptation. Here, we used replicate populations of Drosophila melanogaster to artificially select on male desiccation resistance while manipulating the opportunity for precopulatory sexual selection in a factorial design. Following five generations of artificial selection, we measured the desiccation resistance of males and females to test whether the addition of sexual selection accelerated adaptation. We found a significant interaction between the effects of natural selection and sexual selection: desiccation resistance was highest in populations where sexual selection was allowed to operate. Despite only selecting on males, we also found a correlated response in females. These results provide empirical support for the idea that sexual selection can accelerate the rate of adaptation.",2020,"Robert J Dugand, Aline Gibson Vega, W Jason Kennington, Joseph L Tomkins"
An RNAi screen for secreted factors and cell-surface players in coordinating neuron and glia development in Drosophila,31900209,10.1186/s13041-019-0541-5,"The establishment of the functional nervous system requires coordinated development of neurons and glia in the embryo. Our understanding of underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms, however, remains limited. The developing Drosophila visual system is an excellent model for understanding the developmental control of the nervous system. By performing a systematic transgenic RNAi screen, we investigated the requirements of secreted proteins and cell-surface receptors for the development of photoreceptor neurons (R cells) and wrapping glia (WG) in the Drosophila visual system. From the screen, we identified seven genes whose knockdown disrupted the development of R cells and/or WG, including amalgam (ama), domeless (dome), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), kuzbanian (kuz), N-Cadherin (CadN), neuroglian (nrg), and shotgun (shg). Cell-type-specific analysis revealed that ama is required in the developing eye disc for promoting cell proliferation and differentiation, which is essential for the migration of glia in the optic stalk. Our results also suggest that nrg functions in both eye disc and WG for coordinating R-cell and WG development.",2020,"Zhengya Liu, Yong Rao, Yixu Chen"
The expression and regulation of Sex combs reduced protein in Drosophila embryos,2892760,10.1101/gad.1.7.716,"Homeotic genes are expressed in spatially precise patterns during Drosophila development to control segmental differentiation. The Sex combs reduced (Scr) gene of the Antennapedia gene complex is involved in the determination of the labial and prothoracic segments of the embryo. To study both the wild-type pattern of Scr expression and the regulatory relationships of Scr to other regulatory genes, an antibody probe that detects the Scr protein was prepared. We find that the Scr gene product is expressed in a dynamic pattern over the course of embryogenesis, beginning in the ectoderm in parasegment 2 while the germ band is elongated and extending to parasegment 3 during the completion of germ band shortening. The locations of Scr protein correlate well with the part of the embryo that are altered in Scr- mutants. After head involution occurs, Scr protein is also expressed in the ganglion corresponding to parasegment 2 of the ventral nervous system. The precise spatial expression of Scr is attained through regulation by both homeotic genes and segmentation genes. The lack of proper Antennapedia or Polycomb gene function causes ectopic Scr protein expression. Mutations in the segmentation genes fushi tarazu, hunchback, Krüppel, and giant alter the spatial pattern of Scr expression.",1987,"M P Scott, P D Riley, S B Carroll"
The twist gene: isolation of a Drosophila zygotic gene necessary for the establishment of dorsoventral pattern,3106932,10.1093/nar/15.8.3439,"The twist zygotic gene appears to be involved in the establishment of the dorso-ventral pattern in Drosophila embryos. Homozygous twist embryos are partially dorsalized, their gastrulation is abnormal, and they fail to differentiate mesoderm. We determined the temperature-sensitive period of twist around the gastrulation time, and we isolated the gene. A 300 kb chromosomic walk allowed the detection of the 70 kb deletion that delimits the twist region in Df(2R)twiS60. Southern blot analyses of 21 EMS induced twist allele DNAs and systematic Northern blot analyses all over this 70 kb region lead to the localization of the twist gene: within about 10 kb at the left border of the deletion, 2 twist alleles show each a small deletion that uncover a transcription unit whose expression occurs about at the time of gastrulation.",1987,"F Perrin-Schmitt, M el Messal, B Thisse"
Evolutionary origin of cholinergic macromolecules and thyroglobulin,3472239,10.1073/pnas.84.9.2813,"We have compared the amino acid sequences of proteins that are involved in acetylcholine (AcCho) metabolism and cholinergic neurotransmission: choline acetyltransferase (ChoAcTase), acetylcholinesterase (AcChoEase), and a neuronal alpha subunit of nicotinic AcCho receptor (AcChoR). A comparison of Drosophila ChoAcTase and rat neuronal alpha subunit of AcChoR shows a limited segmental type homology, which may suggest a similar acetylcholine binding site in the two proteins evolving by convergence. We note a global homology of 21-44% identity between Drosophila ChoAcTase and Torpedo AcChoEase. Six homologous segments of 40-60 amino acids cover 38% and 54% of the sequences, raising the possibility of a common evolutionary origin. We also note that mammalian thyroglobulin (TG), the precursor for thyroid hormones, contains an AcChoEase-like sequence at its carboxyl end. This homology raises the possibility that the gene for TG has evolved by gene fusion or condensation (i.e., recruiting a preexisting redundant copy of a gene for AcChoEase during vertebrate evolution). Our results demonstrate that the record of evolutionary history for nervous system proteins can be read across the boundaries of separation between vertebrates and invertebrates. They also provide molecular evidence for the common evolutionary origins of the nervous and endocrine systems in vertebrates--both evolving to make intercellular communication possible.",1987,"N Itoh, N Mori, P M Salvaterra"
Separate regulatory elements for the heat-inducible and ovarian expression of the Drosophila hsp26 gene,3935329,10.1016/0092-8674(85)90247-8,"We have constructed and transformed into the D. melanogaster germ line a series of hsp26 deletion variants. We show that the region -728 to +14 contains all of the cis-acting sequences necessary for the developmental and heat-inducible transcription of hsp26. Sequences upstream of -341 are not required for heat-inducible expression but are required for ovarian expression. Conversely, sequences between -351 and -53 are unnecessary for ovarian expression but are needed for maximal heat-inducible expression. We conclude that most, or all, of the cis-acting regulatory sequences required for hsp26 gene expression during oogenesis are physically separable from those required for heat-inducible expression. These results suggest that different trans-acting factors bind at different regulatory sites in the 5'-flanking region of the gene, thus activating its transcription.",1985,"R S Cohen, M Meselson"
Selective translational regulation of ribosomal protein gene expression during early development of Drosophila melanogaster,3939320,10.1128/mcb.5.12.3583,"We have previously characterized a cloned cDNA coding for a developmentally regulated mRNA in Drosophila melanogaster whose expression is selectively regulated at the translational level during oogenesis and embryogenesis. In this report we show that this translationally regulated mRNA (rpA1) codes for an acidic ribosomal protein. Furthermore, our results indicate that most ribosomal protein mRNAs are regulated similarly to rpA1 mRNA. This conclusion is based on cell-free translation of mRNAs derived from polysomes and postpolysomal supernatants as well as in vivo labeling experiments. Thus, the translation of many ribosomal protein mRNAs appears to be temporally related to the synthesis of rRNA during D. melanogaster development. The relationship between rRNA transcription and ribosomal protein mRNA translation was further investigated by genetically reducing rRNA synthesis with the use of bobbed mutants. Unexpectedly, neither ribosomal protein mRNA abundance nor translation was altered in these mutants.",1985,"M A Kay, M Jacobs-Lorena"
