The spatial association of gene expression evolves from synchrony to asynchrony and stochasticity with age,21912663,10.1371/journal.pone.0024076,"For multicellular organisms, different tissues coordinate to integrate physiological functions, although this systematically and gradually declines in the aging process. Therefore, an association exists between tissue coordination and aging, and investigating the evolution of tissue coordination with age is of interest. In the past decade, both common and heterogeneous aging processes among tissues were extensively investigated. The results on spatial association of gene changes that determine lifespan appear complex and paradoxical. To reconcile observed commonality and heterogeneity of gene changes among tissues and to address evolution feature of tissue coordination with age, we introduced a new analytical strategy to systematically analyze genome-wide spatio-temporal gene expression profiles. We first applied the approach to natural aging process in three species (Rat, Mouse and Drosophila) and then to anti-aging process in Mouse. The results demonstrated that temporal gene expression alteration in different tissues experiences a progressive association evolution from spatial synchrony to asynchrony and stochasticity with age. This implies that tissue coordination gradually declines with age. Male mice showed earlier spatial asynchrony in gene expression than females, suggesting that male animals are more prone to aging than females. The confirmed anti-aging interventions (resveratrol and caloric restriction) enhanced tissue coordination, indicating their underlying anti-aging mechanism on multiple tissue levels. Further, functional analysis suggested asynchronous DNA/protein damage accumulation as well as asynchronous repair, modification and degradation of DNA/protein in tissues possibly contributes to asynchronous and stochastic changes of tissue microenvironment. This increased risk for a variety of age-related diseases such as neurodegeneration and cancer that eventually accelerate organismal aging and death. Our study suggests a novel molecular event occurring in aging process of multicellular species that may represent an intrinsic molecular mechanism of aging.",2011,"Jianhua Huang, Xinmin Zhang, Bin Wu, Qi Wang, Xiaoyu Liu, Ziyin Shen"
Formation of regulatory modules by local sequence duplication,21998564,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002167,"Turnover of regulatory sequence and function is an important part of molecular evolution. But what are the modes of sequence evolution leading to rapid formation and loss of regulatory sites? Here we show that a large fraction of neighboring transcription factor binding sites in the fly genome have formed from a common sequence origin by local duplications. This mode of evolution is found to produce regulatory information: duplications can seed new sites in the neighborhood of existing sites. Duplicate seeds evolve subsequently by point mutations, often towards binding a different factor than their ancestral neighbor sites. These results are based on a statistical analysis of 346 cis-regulatory modules in the Drosophila melanogaster genome, and a comparison set of intergenic regulatory sequence in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In fly regulatory modules, pairs of binding sites show significantly enhanced sequence similarity up to distances of about 50 bp. We analyze these data in terms of an evolutionary model with two distinct modes of site formation: (i) evolution from independent sequence origin and (ii) divergent evolution following duplication of a common ancestor sequence. Our results suggest that pervasive formation of binding sites by local sequence duplications distinguishes the complex regulatory architecture of higher eukaryotes from the simpler architecture of unicellular organisms.",2011,"Armita Nourmohammad, Michael Lässig"
Recombination-mediated genetic engineering of large genomic DNA transgenes,22065454,10.1007/978-1-61779-228-1_26,"Faithful gene activity reporters are a useful tool for evo-devo studies enabling selective introduction of specific loci between species and assaying the activity of large gene regulatory sequences. The use of large genomic constructs such as BACs and fosmids provides an efficient platform for exploration of gene function under endogenous regulatory control. Despite their large size they can be easily engineered using in vivo homologous recombination in Escherichia coli (recombineering). We have previously demonstrated that the efficiency and fidelity of recombineering are sufficient to allow high-throughput transgene engineering in liquid culture, and have successfully applied this approach in several model systems. Here, we present a detailed protocol for recombineering of BAC/fosmid transgenes for expression of fluorescent or affinity tagged proteins in Drosophila under endogenous in vivo regulatory control. The tag coding sequence is seamlessly recombineered into the genomic region contained in the BAC/fosmid clone, which is then integrated into the fly genome using ϕC31 recombination. This protocol can be easily adapted to other recombineering projects.",2011,"Andrei Pozniakovsky, Pavel Tomancak, Mihail Sarov, Peter Ahlfeld, Radoslaw Kamil Ejsmont, A Francis Stewart"
Deletion of Drosophila muscle LIM protein decreases flight muscle stiffness and power generation,21562304,10.1152/ajpcell.00206.2010,"Muscle LIM protein (MLP) can be found at the Z-disk of sarcomeres where it is hypothesized to be involved in sensing muscle stretch. Loss of murine MLP results in dilated cardiomyopathy, and mutations in human MLP lead to cardiac hypertrophy, indicating a critical role for MLP in maintaining normal cardiac function. Loss of MLP in Drosophila (mlp84B) also leads to muscle dysfunction, providing a model system to examine MLP's mechanism of action. Mlp84B-null flies that survive to adulthood are not able to fly or beat their wings. Transgenic expression of the mlp84B gene in the Mlp84B-null background rescues flight ability and restores wing beating ability. Mechanical analysis of skinned flight muscle fibers showed a 30% decrease in oscillatory power production and a slight increase in the frequency at which maximum power is generated for fibers lacking Mlp84B compared with rescued fibers. Mlp84B-null muscle fibers displayed a 25% decrease in passive, active, and rigor stiffness compared with rescued fibers, but no significant decrease in isometric tension generation was observed. Muscle ultrastructure of Mlp84B-null muscle fibers is grossly normal; however, the null fibers have a slight decrease, 11%, in thick filament number per unit cross-sectional area. Our data indicate that MLP contributes to muscle stiffness and is necessary for maximum work and power generation.",2011,"Heather Lesage-Horton, Douglas M Swank, Mary C Beckerle, Kathleen A Clark, Cuiping Zhao"
Epithelial homeostasis and the underlying molecular mechanisms in the gut of the insect model Drosophila melanogaster,21964927,10.1007/s00018-011-0828-x,"Insects mostly develop on decaying and contaminated organic matter and often serve as vectors of biologically transmitted diseases by transporting microorganisms to the plant and animal hosts. As such, insects are constantly ingesting microorganisms, a small fraction of which reach their epithelial surfaces, mainly their digestive tract, where they can establish relationships ranging from symbiosis to mutualism or even parasitism. Understanding the tight physical, genetic, and biochemical interactions that takes place between intestinal epithelia and either resident or infectious microbes has been a long-lasting objective of the immunologist. Research in this field has recently been re-vitalized with the development of deep sequencing techniques, which allow qualitative and quantitative characterization of gut microbiota. Interestingly, the recent identification of regenerative stem cells in the Drosophila gut together with the initial characterization of Drosophila gut microbiota have opened up new avenues of study aimed at understanding the mechanisms that regulate the dialog between the Drosophila gut epithelium and its microbiota of this insect model. The fact that some of the responses are conserved across species combined with the power of Drosophila genetics could make this organism model a useful tool to further elucidate some aspects of the interaction occurring between the microbiota and the human gut.",2011,Julien Royet
Detection of genetically altered copper levels in Drosophila tissues by synchrotron x-ray fluorescence microscopy,22053217,10.1371/journal.pone.0026867,"Tissue-specific manipulation of known copper transport genes in Drosophila tissues results in phenotypes that are presumably due to an alteration in copper levels in the targeted cells. However direct confirmation of this has to date been technically challenging. Measures of cellular copper content such as expression levels of copper-responsive genes or cuproenzyme activity levels, while useful, are indirect. First-generation copper-sensitive fluorophores show promise but currently lack the sensitivity required to detect subtle changes in copper levels. Moreover such techniques do not provide information regarding other relevant biometals such as zinc or iron. Traditional techniques for measuring elemental composition such as inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy are not sensitive enough for use with the small tissue amounts available in Drosophila research. Here we present synchrotron x-ray fluorescence microscopy analysis of two different Drosophila tissues, the larval wing imaginal disc, and sectioned adult fly heads and show that this technique can be used to detect changes in tissue copper levels caused by targeted manipulation of known copper homeostasis genes.",2011,"Daryl L Howard, Joab E C Hwang, David Paterson, Jessica C Lye, Martin D de Jonge, Richard Burke"
Pleiotropic consequences of misexpression of the developmentally active and stress-inducible non-coding hsrω gene in Drosophila,21654081,10.1007/s12038-011-9061-x,"The non-coding hsrω gene of Drosophila melanogaster is expressed in nearly all cell types and developmental stages. However, in the absence of conventional mutant alleles of this gene, its developmental functions remain largely unknown. In the present study, we used a variety of GAL4 drivers to overexpress or ablate this gene’s transcripts in specific tissues and examined the developmental consequences thereof. Our results show that a balanced expression of these non-coding transcripts is critical for survival and normal development in all the tissue types tested, since any change in cellular levels of these transcripts in a given cell type generally has detrimental effects, with extreme cases resulting in organismal lethality, although in a few cases the misexpression of these transcripts also suppresses the mutant phenotype due to other genetic conditions. Evidence is also presented for existence of a new spliced variant of the hsrω-n nuclear transcript. Following the RNAi-mediated down-regulation of hsrω transcripts, the omega speckles disappear so that the nucleoplasmic hnRNPs get diffusely distributed, while upregulation of these transcripts results in greater sequestration of these proteins into omega speckle clusters; either of these conditions would affect activities of the hnRNPs and other hsrω-RNA interacting proteins, which is likely to have cascading consequences. The present findings, together with our earlier observations on effects of altered levels of the hsrω transcripts on induced apoptosis and expanded polyQ-mediated neurodegeneration, further confirm that ncRNA species like the hsrω, far from being evolutionary hangovers, provide critical information for important functions in normal cells.",2011,"Subhash C Lakhotia, Moushami Mallik"
A screen for conditional growth suppressor genes identifies the Drosophila homolog of HD-PTP as a regulator of the oncoprotein Yorkie,21571226,10.1016/j.devcel.2011.04.012,"Mammalian cancers depend on ""multiple hits,"" some of which promote growth and some of which block apoptosis. We screened for mutations that require a synergistic block in apoptosis to promote tissue overgrowth and identified myopic (mop), the Drosophila homolog of the candidate tumor-suppressor and endosomal regulator His-domain protein tyrosine phosphatase (HD-PTP). We find that Myopic regulates the Salvador/Warts/Hippo (SWH) tumor suppressor pathway: Myopic PPxY motifs bind conserved residues in the WW domains of the transcriptional coactivator Yorkie, and Myopic colocalizes with Yorkie at endosomes. Myopic controls Yorkie endosomal association and protein levels, ultimately influencing expression of some Yorkie target genes. However, the antiapoptotic gene diap1 is not affected, which may explain the conditional nature of the myopic growth phenotype. These data establish Myopic as a Yorkie regulator and implicate Myopic-dependent association of Yorkie with endosomal compartments as a regulatory step in nuclear outputs of the SWH pathway.",2011,"Alexey Veraksa, Kenneth H Moberg, Marla Tipping, M Melissa Gilbert"
Self-maintained escort cells form a germline stem cell differentiation niche,22031542,10.1242/dev.067850,"Stem cell self-renewal is controlled by concerted actions of niche signals and intrinsic factors in a variety of systems. In the Drosophila ovary, germline stem cells (GSCs) in the niche continuously self-renew and generate differentiated germ cells that interact physically with escort cells (ECs). It has been proposed that escort stem cells (ESCs), which directly contact GSCs, generate differentiated ECs to maintain the EC population. However, it remains unclear whether the differentiation status of germ cells affects EC behavior and how the interaction between ECs and germ cells is regulated. In this study, we have found that ECs can undergo slow cell turnover regardless of their positions, and the lost cells are replenished by their neighboring ECs via self-duplication rather than via stem cells. ECs extend elaborate cellular processes that exhibit extensive interactions with differentiated germ cells. Interestingly, long cellular processes of ECs are absent when GSC progeny fail to differentiate, suggesting that differentiated germ cells are required for the formation or maintenance of EC cellular processes. Disruption of Rho functions leads to the disruption of long EC cellular processes and the accumulation of ill-differentiated single germ cells by increasing BMP signaling activity outside the GSC niche, and also causes gradual EC loss. Therefore, our findings indicate that ECs interact extensively with differentiated germ cells through their elaborate cellular processes and control proper germ cell differentiation. Here, we propose that ECs form a niche that controls GSC lineage differentiation and is maintained by a non-stem cell mechanism.",2011,"Ting Xie, Su Wang, Daniel Kirilly"
SFRPs act as negative modulators of ADAM10 to regulate retinal neurogenesis,21478884,10.1038/nn.2794,"It is well established that retinal neurogenesis in mouse embryos requires the activation of Notch signaling, but is independent of the Wnt signaling pathway. We found that genetic inactivation of Sfrp1 and Sfrp2, two postulated Wnt antagonists, perturbs retinal neurogenesis. In retinas from Sfrp1(-/-); Sfrp2(-/-) embryos, Notch signaling was transiently upregulated because Sfrps bind ADAM10 metalloprotease and downregulate its activity, an important step in Notch activation. The proteolysis of other ADAM10 substrates, including APP, was consistently altered in Sfrp mutants, whereas pharmacological inhibition of ADAM10 partially rescued the Sfrp1(-/-); Sfrp2(-/-) retinal phenotype. Conversely, ectopic Sfrp1 expression in the Drosophila wing imaginal disc prevented the expression of Notch targets, and this was restored by the coexpression of Kuzbanian, the Drosophila ADAM10 homolog. Together, these data indicate that Sfrps inhibit the ADAM10 metalloprotease, which might have important implications in pathological events, including cancer and Alzheimer's disease.",2011,"Maria Luisa Toribio, Carmen Ibañez, Isabel Guerrero, Pilar Esteve, Joaquin Arribas, Jordi Malapeira, Severine Marcos, Akihiko Shimono, Inmaculada Crespo, Sara Gonzalez-Garcia, Paola Bovolenta, Marcos Cardozo, Africa Sandonìs"
The oligomeric state of CtBP determines its role as a transcriptional co-activator and co-repressor of Wingless targets,21468031,10.1038/emboj.2011.100,"C-terminal-binding protein (CtBP) is a well-characterized transcriptional co-repressor that requires homo-dimerization for its activity. CtBP can both repress and activate Wingless nuclear targets in Drosophila. Here, we examine the role of CtBP dimerization in these opposing processes. CtBP mutants that cannot dimerize are able to promote Wingless signalling, but are defective in repressing Wingless targets. To further test the role of dimerization in repression, the positions of basic and acidic residues that form inter-molecular salt bridges in the CtBP dimerization interface were swapped. These mutants cannot homo-dimerize and are compromised for repression. However, their co-expression leads to hetero-dimerization and consequent repression of Wingless targets. Our results support a model where CtBP is a gene-specific regulator of Wingless signalling, with some targets requiring CtBP dimers for inhibition while other targets utilize CtBP monomers for activation of their expression. Functional interactions between CtBP and Pygopus, a nuclear protein required for Wingless signalling, support a model where monomeric CtBP acts downstream of Pygopus in activating some Wingless targets.",2011,"Jinhee L Chang, David L Akey, Ken M Cadigan, Chandan Bhambhani"
Drosophila Nora virus capsid proteins differ from those of other picorna-like viruses,21605604,10.1016/j.virusres.2011.05.006,"The recently discovered Nora virus from Drosophila melanogaster is a single-stranded RNA virus. Its published genomic sequence encodes a typical picorna-like cassette of replicative enzymes, but no capsid proteins similar to those in other picorna-like viruses. We have now done additional sequencing at the termini of the viral genome, extending it by 455 nucleotides at the 5' end, but no more coding sequence was found. The completeness of the final 12,333-nucleotide sequence was verified by the production of infectious virus from the cloned genome. To identify the capsid proteins, we purified Nora virus particles and analyzed their proteins by mass spectrometry. Our results show that the capsid is built from three major proteins, VP4A, B and C, encoded in the fourth open reading frame of the viral genome. The viral particles also contain traces of a protein from the third open reading frame, VP3. VP4A and B are not closely related to other picorna-like virus capsid proteins in sequence, but may form similar jelly roll folds. VP4C differs from the others and is predicted to have an essentially α-helical conformation. In a related virus, identified from EST database sequences from Nasonia parasitoid wasps, VP4C is encoded in a separate open reading frame, separated from VP4A and B by a frame-shift. This opens a possibility that VP4C is produced in non-equimolar quantities. Altogether, our results suggest that the Nora virus capsid has a different protein organization compared to the order Picornavirales.",2011,"Mazen S Habayeb, Vaibhav Srivastava, Thomas Kieselbach, Jens-Ola Ekström, Dan Hultmark, Gunnar Wingsle"
[Patterns of transposable elements distribution on the Drosophila melanogaster polytene chromosomes before and after selection for a quantitative trait],21870509,,"The effect of selection for radius vein length on the distribution of hybridization sites of the P and hobo transposons and the mdgl and mdg2 retrotransposons on polytene chromosomes of Drosophila melanogaster salivary glands was studied. The patterns of these transposable elements (TEs) distribution were polymorphic in both the parental strain and selected strains. The similarity in mdg1 and mdg2 patterns between strains selected in one direction was closer than between strains selected in opposite directions, but the selected strains were closer to each other than to the parental strain regardless of selection direction. No mdg2 hybridization sites that would be absent in the control were found in the selected strains. There were more mdg2 and hobo hybridization sites in the strains selected in the (+) direction than in the (-) direction. The mobility of hobo copies in the strains studied correlated with the presence of its full-sized copy in the genome. The polymorphism of all TEs studied except for mdgl was greater for strains selected in the (+) direction that in the (-) direction. These facts suggest that some TEs migrate over the genome independently of selection, and others are markers of evolutionary events rather than their causes.",2011,"M P Perepelkina, L A Vasil'eva, L P Zakharenko, O V Antonenko, O V Vykhristiuk, V M Efimov"
XPORT-dependent transport of TRP and rhodopsin,22099462,10.1016/j.neuron.2011.09.016,"TRP channels have emerged as key biological sensors in vision, taste, olfaction, hearing, and touch. Despite their importance, virtually nothing is known about the folding and transport of TRP channels during biosynthesis. Here, we identify XPORT (exit protein of rhodopsin and TRP) as a critical chaperone for TRP and its G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), rhodopsin (Rh1). XPORT is a resident ER and secretory pathway protein that interacts with TRP and Rh1, as well as with Hsp27 and Hsp90. XPORT promotes the targeting of TRP to the membrane in Drosophila S2 cells, a finding that provides a critical first step toward solving a longstanding problem in the successful heterologous expression of TRP. Mutations in xport result in defective transport of TRP and Rh1, leading to retinal degeneration. Our results identify XPORT as a molecular chaperone and provide a mechanistic link between TRP channels and their GPCRs during biosynthesis and transport.",2011,"Nansi Jo Colley, Erica E Rosenbaum, Che-Hsiung Liu, Roger C Hardie, Eva Vasiljevic, Kimberley S Brehm"
Drosophila melanogaster as a model host for the study of microbial pathogenicity and the discovery of novel antimicrobial compounds,21470115,10.2174/138161211795703744,"The past few decades have seen alarming rates of antimicrobial drug resistance. This trend paralleled a lack of conventional methods of discovery of antibiotics with novel mechanisms of action. Although use of mammalian models remains indispensable for preclinical testing of new antimicrobial compounds, combating emerging multidrug-resistant microbial pathogens may require the use of robust, high-throughput experimental systems that can accelerate drug development. The recent discovery of striking similarities in innate immune signaling pathways between Drosophila melanogaster and mammals has led to a surge in the use of this minihost as an alternative model in studying a variety of infectious diseases. Several genetic screens for microbial pathogenicity in Drosophila identified virulence traits shown to be important for infection in mammals that may serve as targets for future drug development. In addition, conventional antimicrobial agents retain full activity in D. melanogaster infection models, which may pave the way for use of this minihost for high-throughput antimicrobial drug screening. Finally, the availability of genetic tools that allow for conditional inactivation of almost every gene in D. melanogaster is anticipated to result in the discovery of novel immunomodulatory mechanisms of action of newly identified antimicrobial compounds. Overall, the powerful genetics of and capacity for large-scale screening in D. melanogaster make this minihost a promising complementary model that may result in a new paradigm in antimicrobial drug discovery. However, antimicrobial drug discovery in such heterologous, phylogenetically disparate minihosts as the fruit flies, would still require further validation in mammalian models.",2011,"George Samonis, Georgios Chamilos, Dimitrios P Kontoyiannis"
Canoe functions at the CNS midline glia in a complex with Shotgun and Wrapper-Nrx-IV during neuron-glia interactions,21389054,10.1242/dev.056192,"Vertebrates and insects alike use glial cells as intermediate targets to guide growing axons. Similar to vertebrate oligodendrocytes, Drosophila midline glia ensheath and separate axonal commissures. Neuron-glia interactions are crucial during these events, although the proteins involved remain largely unknown. Here, we show that Canoe (Cno), the Drosophila ortholog of AF-6, and the DE-cadherin Shotgun (Shg) are highly restricted to the interface between midline glia and commissural axons. cno mutant analysis, genetic interactions and co-immunoprecipitation assays unveil Cno function as a novel regulator of neuron-glia interactions, forming a complex with Shg, Wrapper and Neurexin IV, the homolog of vertebrate Caspr/paranodin.

Adenovirus-mediated Drosophila melanogaster deoxyribonucleoside kinase mutants combined with gemcitabine harbor a safe cancer treatment profile,21186401,10.3892/ijo.2010.887,"The purpose of this analysis was to investigate the enzyme activity and specificity of adenovirus-mediated Drosophila melanogaster deoxyribonucleoside kinase (Dm-dNK) mutants in combination with gemcitabine. Compared to herpes simplex type 1 thymidine kinases (HSV-TK) and other known dNKs, this Dm-dNK enzyme has a broader substrate specificity and a higher catalytic rate. We created the Dm-dNK mutants (dNKmut) by site-directed mutagenesis at the sites of 244E, 245S, 251S, and 252R, with the last 10 amino acids in the amino acid sequence randomly alternated. We subsequently evaluated the enzyme activity and substrate specificity. The engineered enzymes showed a relative increase in phosphorylation in the nucleoside analogs of gemcitabine (dFdC, 2',2'-difluoro-deoxycytidine) compared to the wild-type enzyme. The dNKmut enzymes were expressed in breast (Bcap37) and gastric (SGC-7901) cancer cell lines. In studying the sensitivity of the cell lines to dFdC, conditionally replicative adenovirus (CRAd) ZD55-dNKmut showed higher expression and enzymatic activity than the replication-defective adenovirus Ad-dNKmut in cancer cells, but with less cytotoxicity to cancer cells than that of Ad-dNKmut. Our data suggest that the triple phosphorylated dFdC catalyzed by dNKmut inhibited the replication of adenovirus with a simultaneous positive therapeutic effect on cancer cells. Therefore, concomitant use of the ZD55-dNKmut and dFdC could be a novel targeted strategy in suicide gene therapy with safe control of excessive virus replication.",2011,"Xinyu Zheng, Lei Zhao, Huimian Xu, Shuai Ma, Zhi Zhu, Anning He, Zhe Sun"
Homeostatic control of neural activity: a Drosophila model for drug tolerance and dependence,21906535,10.1016/B978-0-12-387003-2.00002-1,"Drug addiction is a complex condition of compulsive drug use that results in devastating physical and social consequences. Drosophila melanogaster has recently emerged as a valuable genetic model for investigating the mechanisms of addiction. Drug tolerance is a measurable endophenotype of addiction that can be easily generated and detected in animal models. The counteradaptive theory for drug dependence postulates that the homeostatic adaptations that produce drug tolerance become counteradaptive after drug clearance, resulting in symptoms of dependence. In flies, a single sedation with ethanol or with an organic solvent anesthetic (benzyl alcohol) induces functional tolerance, an adaptation of the nervous system that reduces the effect of these neural depressants. Here we review the role of the BK channel gene (slo) and genes that encode other synaptic proteins in the process of producing functional tolerance. These proteins are predicted to be part of an orchestrated response that involves specific interactions across a highly complex synaptic protein network. The response of the slo gene to drug exposure and the consequence of induced slo expression fit nicely the tenets of the counteradaptive theory for drug tolerance and dependence. Induction of slo expression represents an adaptive process that generates tolerance because it enhances neuronal excitability, which counters the sedative effects of the drugs. After drug clearance, however, the increase in slo expression leads to an allostatic withdrawal state that is characterized by an increase in the susceptibility for seizure. Together, these results demonstrate a common origin for development of drug tolerance and withdrawal hyperexcitability in Drosophila.",2011,"Alfredo Ghezzi, Nigel S Atkinson"
A novel interaction between hedgehog and Notch promotes proliferation at the anterior-posterior organizer of the Drosophila wing,21098717,10.1534/genetics.110.125138,"Notch has multiple roles in the development of the Drosophila melanogaster wing imaginal disc.

We show that Notch signaling is activated in the cells of the anterior-posterior organizer that produce the region between wing veins 3 and 4, and we describe strong genetic interactions between the gene that encodes the Hedgehog pathway activator Smoothened and the Notch pathway genes Notch, presenilin, and Suppressor of Hairless and the Enhancer of split complex.

A presynaptic endosomal trafficking pathway controls synaptic growth signaling,21464232,10.1083/jcb.201009052,"Structural remodeling of synapses in response to growth signals leads to long-lasting alterations in neuronal function in many systems. Synaptic growth factor receptors alter their signaling properties during transit through the endocytic pathway, but the mechanisms controlling cargo traffic between endocytic compartments remain unclear. Nwk (Nervous Wreck) is a presynaptic F-BAR/SH3 protein that regulates synaptic growth signaling in Drosophila melanogaster. In this paper, we show that Nwk acts through a physical interaction with sorting nexin 16 (SNX16). SNX16 promotes synaptic growth signaling by activated bone morphogenic protein receptors, and live imaging in neurons reveals that SNX16-positive early endosomes undergo transient interactions with Nwk-containing recycling endosomes. We identify an alternative signal termination pathway in the absence of Snx16 that is controlled by endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT)-mediated internalization of receptors into the endosomal lumen. Our results define a presynaptic trafficking pathway mediated by SNX16, NWK, and the ESCRT complex that functions to control synaptic growth signaling at the interface between endosomal compartments.",2011,"Aline D Blunk, J Troy Littleton, Yulia Akbergenova, Ramon A Jorquera, Lauren K Buhl, Avital A Rodal"
Effect of PARP-1 overexpression and pharmacological inhibition of NF-kB on the lifespan of Drosophila melanogaster,22184968,,"Age-dependent accumulation of genome rearrangements leads to cellular senescence, overall aging and lifespan decreasing of the organism. In this respect, it is important to study the effect of overexpression of DNA repair genes on the lifespan and aging parameters (rates of age-related decline of fertility and locomotor activity). The present work investigates how the overexpression of the PARP-1 gene, which is involved in various mechanisms of DNA repair (base excision repair and DNA double-strand breaks repair), combined with a pharmacological inhibition of the NF-kB transcription factor that controls the genes of inflammatory response, affects the lifespan of Drosophila melanogaster. It is demonstrated that in males, constitutive activation of PARP-1 overexpression in the nervous system throughout the lifetime results in reduced median (by 14%) and maximum (by 8%) lifespan, whereas in females the median (by 14%) and maximum (by 20%) lifespan increases. Activation of PARP-1 overexpression in the imago (conditionally) results in extension of the median (by 3-16%) and the maximum (by 10-15%) lifespan in females and males, respectively. The lifespan increase in females with PARP-1 conditional overexpression was accompanied by decrease of fertility. Selective pharmacological inhibition of transcription factor NF-kB with pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate increases the median (by 13-20%) and the maximum (by 11-14%) lifespan in females and males, respectively. No synergic effect between conditionally activated PARP-1 expression and NF-kB inhibition is observed.

Role for Traf4 in polarizing adherens junctions as a prerequisite for efficient cell shape changes,21986496,10.1128/MCB.05542-11,"Apical constriction of epithelial cells is a widely used morphogenetic mechanism. In the Drosophila embryo, the apical constrictions that internalize the mesoderm are controlled by the transcription factor Twist and require intact adherens junctions and a contractile acto-myosin network. We find that adherens junctions in constricting mesodermal cells undergo extensive remodeling. A Twist target gene encoding a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor (TRAF) family, Traf4, is involved in this process. While TRAFs are best known for their functions in inflammatory responses, Traf4 appears to have a different role, and its mechanism of action is poorly understood. We show that Traf4 is required for efficient apical constriction during ventral furrow formation and for proper localization of Armadillo to the apical position in constricting cells. Traf4 and Armadillo interact with each other physically and functionally. Traf4 acts in a TNF receptor- and Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK)-independent manner to fine-tune the assembly of adherens junctions in the invaginating mesodermal cells.",2011,"Maria Leptin, Sam J Mathew, Martina Rembold"
Origin of sexual isolation in Drosophila ananassae due to founder effects,21626152,10.1007/s10709-011-9582-0,"The origin of sexual isolation is the central event in the evolution of biological species and plays a key role in maintaining biological diversity.

The RTW provides mechanical support to the apical microvilli and is likely to guide Rab11-dependent delivery of Rh1-rich membrane to the rhabdomere from the trans Golgi network. However, the nature and function of the molecular pathway involved in RTW morphogenesis remains incomplete. Here, we show that Rh1 function in promoting RTW morphogenesis is light-independent and is conserved throughout evolution. This Rh1 function does not require G(q)α(e), which is required for phototransduction. Finally, we show that interfering with Dynamin- and Rab5-dependent endocytosis leads to a phenotype that is undistinguishable from that of the ninaE-null mutant. Importantly, the corresponding endocytic activity is essential to prevent early onset of rhabdomere degeneration. In conclusion, we propose that Rh1 function in promoting RTW morphogenesis is not only needed to sustain apical membrane delivery but is also required for proper rhabdomeric membrane endocytosis and turnover.",2011,"Franck Pichaud, Noelia Pinal"
Effects of photoperiodically induced reproductive diapause and cold hardening on the cold tolerance of Drosophila montana,20932841,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2010.09.007,"Coping with seasonal and daily variation in environmental conditions requires that organisms are able to adjust their reproduction and stress tolerance according to environmental conditions. Females of Drosophila montana populations have adapted to survive over the dark and cold winters at high latitudes and altitudes by spending this season in photoperiodically controlled reproductive diapause and reproducing only in spring/summer. The present study showed that flies of a northern population of this species are quite tolerant of low temperatures and show high seasonal and short-term plasticity in this trait. Culturing the flies in short day length (nearly all females in reproductive diapause), as well as allowing the flies to get cold hardened before the cold treatment, increased the cold tolerance of both sexes both in chill coma recovery time test and in mortality assay. Chill coma recovery time test performed for the females of two additional D. montana populations cultured in a day length where about half of the females enter diapause, also showed that diapause can increase female cold tolerance even without a change in day length. Direct linkage between diapause and cold tolerance was found in only two strains representing a high-altitude population of the species, but the phenomenon will certainly be worth of studying in northern and southern populations of the species with larger data sets.",2011,"Anneli Hoikkala, Laura Vesala"
Mitochondrial involvement in cell death of non-mammalian eukaryotes,20950655,10.1016/j.bbamcr.2010.10.008,"Although mitochondria are essential organelles for long-term survival of eukaryotic cells, recent discoveries in biochemistry and genetics have advanced our understanding of the requirements for mitochondria in cell death. Much of what we understand about cell death is based on the identification of conserved cell death genes in Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans. However, the role of mitochondria in cell death in these models has been much less clear. Considering the active role that mitochondria play in apoptosis in mammalian cells, the mitochondrial contribution to cell death in non-mammalian systems has been an area of active investigation. In this article, we review the current research on this topic in three non-mammalian models, C. elegans, Drosophila, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In addition, we discuss how non-mammalian models have provided important insight into the mechanisms of human disease as they relate to the mitochondrial pathway of cell death. The unique perspective derived from each of these model systems provides a more complete understanding of mitochondria in programmed cell death.

Two sodium-channel genes in Drosophila: implications for channel diversity,2538830,10.1073/pnas.86.6.2079,"We describe two Drosophila melanogaster transcription units that are highly homologous to a rat Na+-channel cDNA. They appear to encode the major subunits of two distinct Na+-channel proteins.

(1987) Science 237, 744-749]. The other transcription unit maps to position 14C/D, on the X chromosome, close to the paralyzed (para) gene. Mutations in para affect membrane excitability in Drosophila neurons [Ganetzky, B. & Wu, C.F. (1986) Annu. Rev. Genet. 20, 13-44].

Mobile genetic elements in Drosophila melanogaster (recent experiments),2561113,10.1139/g89-163,"Recent data obtained in the authors' laboratories concerning the behaviour of mobile genetic elements of Drosophila melanogaster are reviewed. It was found that the mobile element jockey represents the typical LINE element. It is efficiently transcribed in D. melanogaster cells in flies and in culture. Transcription is initiated from the +1 nucleotide of jockey and depends on an internal promoter. This is the first case of an internal promoter being used by RNA polymerase II. Several events which take place during the transposition bursts in ctMR2 family of strains were described. Among them are the removal of mobile dispersed genetics (mdg) elements (with solo long terminal repeat (LTR) remaining at the site of excision), complete removal of an mdg element, and reinsertion of the same mdg to the same place either in the presence or in absence of solo LTR sequence. Finally, the formation of deletions was observed. A 462-bp deletion destroying the white locus can be further repaired (w+ reversion). Thus, transposition bursts include many different genetic events. A novel system of prolonged genome destabilization was described. It depends on mobilization of a new mobile element called Stalker. After certain crosses Stalker actively moves for dozens of generations giving rise to large numbers of insertion mutations. Several novel genes were detected using mobilized Stalker. They include a modifier of mdg4 and six enhancers of yellow mutations.",1989,"L J Mizrokhi, G P Georgiev, A F Priimägi, T I Gerasimova, P G Georgiev, O B Simonova, S G Georgieva, N A Tchurikov, S L Kiselev, Y V Ilyin"
Conserved function in Nicotiana tabacum of a single Drosophila hsp70 promoter heat shock element when fused to a minimal T-DNA promoter,2559318,10.1007/BF00261151,"To demonstrate the extent of evolutionary conservation in the mechanism of induction of heat shock genes between plants and animals, the minimal sequence from the Drosophila hsp70 promoter sufficient to confer heat shock inducible transcription in tobacco was determined. Segments of the hsp70 promoter were fused to a minimal promoter of the T-DNA indole-3-acetamide hydrolase (iaaH) gene, in a chimaeric gene fusion to a neomycin phosphotransferase (NPT II) reporter gene. Sequences bearing one or more heat shock elements (HSEs) rendered the minimal promoter heat shock inducible, with a 37 bp fragment containing a single complete HSE sufficing. The induced NPT II mRNA peaked during the heat shock period, but the maximal level of NPT II activity was not observed until 4 h later in the recovery phase, showing that the translation of the NPT II mRNA was shifted from the heat shock period of the recovery phase. That similar sequences containing a single HSE of the Drosophila hsp70 promoter could function in both flies and tobacco indicates the high degree of homology between the two heat shock gene induction systems.",1989,"D Wing, C Koncz, J Schell"
Complementary homeo protein gradients in developing limb buds,2568311,10.1101/gad.3.5.641,"A new human homeo box-containing gene designated Hox-5.2 was cloned and mapped to human chromosome 2. This homeo box is related in sequence to Abdominal-B, a Drosophila homeotic gene that specifies identity of posterior segments. An antibody probe was made using a human Hox-5.2 fusion protein and was found to stain posterior regions of mouse, chicken, and Xenopus embryos. Unexpectedly, when the distribution of Hox-5.2 antigen was compared with that of X1Hbox 1 antigen, a non-overlapping and mutually exclusive pattern was detected (e.g., in developing limb buds, intestine, and somites). Regions expressing Hox-5.2 do not express X1Hbox 1 protein, and vice versa. Hox-5.2 antigen is detected strongly in developing fore- and hindlimb buds, where it forms a gradient of nuclear protein throughout most of the mesenchyme. This gradient is maximal in distal and posterior regions. Hox-5.2 expression is activated in Xenopus limb regeneration blastemas, as expected for any gene involved in pattern formation. As described previously, a gradient of X1Hbox 1 protein can be detected in the forelimb. The latter gradient has the opposite polarity to that of Hox-5.2. i.e., maximal in anterior and proximal mesoderm. These two opposing gradients (and possibly others) could be involved in determining positional values in developing limb buds.",1989,"W Fiske, T Mohandas, G Oliver, N Sidell, E M De Robertis, C Heinzmann, R S Sparkes"
Analysis of the Om(1D) locus in Drosophila ananassae,2557262,,"From the ca;px stock, which is the progenitor of Om mutants caused by insertions of the tom retrotransposon, 50 kb of genomic DNA including the Om(1D) locus was cloned by tom tagging and chromosome walking. Southern blot analyses of six Om(1D) mutants exposed one or two tom elements inserted at five nonrandom sites within an 18-kb distal segment of the restriction map; the phenotypic uniformity between these mutants was not affected by variations in the position, number or orientation of their inserts. Spontaneous revertants or more extreme derivatives of Om(1D) alleles were nonlinearly associated with losses or gains of tom inserts. Seven of eight radiation induced derivatives of Om(1D) mutants had one breakpoint of a chromosome rearrangement in polytene section 13A which includes the Om(1D) locus. Two Om(1D) derivatives, a spontaneous revertant and an induced extreme allele, were associated with overlapping deficiencies which define a region that is likely to contain the Om(1D) coding seguences proximal to the tom insertion sites.

Characterization and expression of the human rhoH12 gene product,2501657,10.1128/mcb.9.5.2058,"The rho genes constitute an evolutionarily conserved family having significant homology to the ras oncogene family. These genes have been found in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Drosophila melanogaster, rat, and human; their 21,000-dalton products show strong conservation of structure. In humans, three classes of rho cDNA clones have been identified which differ by virtue of the presence of variable C-terminal domains: rhoH12, rhoH6, and rhoH9. The predicted 193 amino acids of human rhoH12 protein show 88% similarity with those of the human rhoH6 clone, 96.8% similarity with those of the Aplysia rho product, and 81.8% similarity with those of the yeast RHO1 protein. Rat-1 and NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts were transfected with clones containing the normal human rhoH12 allele as well as the variants encoding valine in place of the glycine and leucine in place of the glutamine normally found at residues 14 and 64, respectively. These replacements mirror the changes responsible for oncogenic activation of the related ras-encoded p21 proteins. These mutant rhoH12 clone alleles did not cause focus formation in monolayers or growth in soft agar. However, amplification of normal rhoH12 via cotransfection with a dihydrofolate reductase gene resulted in colonies that displayed reduced dependence on serum for growth, grew to higher saturation densities, and were tumorigenic when inoculated into nude mice. Normal p21rho protein was detected in the transfected cell lines as well as in normal cell lines by Western immunoblot and immunoprecipitation analysis with rabbit antibodies raised against the peptide corresponding to amino acids 122 to 135.",1989,"R A Weinberg, H Avraham"
Interactions between heterologous helix-loop-helix proteins generate complexes that bind specifically to a common DNA sequence,2503252,10.1016/0092-8674(89)90434-0,"A DNA binding and dimerization motif, with apparent amphipathic helices (the HLH motif), has recently been identified in various proteins, including two that bind to immunoglobulin enhancers (E12 and E47). We show here that various HLH proteins can bind as apparent heterodimers to a single DNA motif and also, albeit usually more weakly, as apparent homodimers. The HLH domain can mediate heterodimer formation between either daughterless, E12, or E47 (Class A) and achaete-scute T3 or MyoD (Class B) to form proteins with high affinity for the kappa E2 site in the immunoglobulin kappa chain enhancer. The achaete-scute T3 and MyoD proteins do not form kappa E2-binding heterodimers together, and no active complex with N-myc was evident. The formation of a heterodimer between the daughterless and achaete-scute T3 products may explain the similar phenotypes of mutants at these two loci and the genetic interactions between them.

Characterization of mutations that enhance position-effect variegation in Drosophila melanogaster,2501647,10.1007/BF00334372,"Several mutants that enhance the gene inactivation associated with position-effect variegation [E(var) mutants] have been characterized.

One is located within the chromosomal region occupied by a cluster of Su(var) mutations. All four E(var) mutants enhance the inactivation of several different variegators and therefore they appear to influence position-effect variegation generally. However, the enhancement caused by the single site E(var) mutations is less striking than that caused by the duplication or by loss of the Y chromosome. The interaction between the E(var) mutants and selected Su(var) mutations, as well as the effects of extra Y heterochromatin on E(var) expression, have also been investigated.

Identification of the gene for fly non-muscle myosin heavy chain: Drosophila myosin heavy chains are encoded by a gene family,2498088,,"In contrast to vertebrate species Drosophila has a single myosin heavy chain gene that apparently encodes all sarcomeric heavy chain polypeptides. Flies also contain a cytoplasmic myosin heavy chain polypeptide that by immunological and peptide mapping criteria is clearly different from the major thoracic muscle isoform. Here, we identify the gene that encodes this cytoplasmic isoform and demonstrate that it is distinct from the muscle myosin heavy chain gene. Thus, fly myosin heavy chains are the products of a gene family. Our data suggest that the contractile function required to power myosin based movement in non-muscle cells requires myosin diversity beyond that available in a single heavy chain gene. In addition, we show, that accumulation of cytoplasmic myosin transcripts is regulated in a developmental stage specific fashion, consistent with a key role for this protein in the movements of early embryogenesis.",1989,"L S Goldstein, M S Lutz, R A Laymon, D P Kiehart, A S Ketchum, D Chan, B Nguyen"
DENSITY-DEPENDENT EVOLUTION OF LIFE-HISTORY TRAITS IN DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER,28568549,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1989.tb04234.x,"Populations of Drosophila melanogaster were maintained for 36 generations in r- and K-selected environments in order to test the life-history predictions of theories on density-dependent selection. In the r-selection environment, populations were reduced to low densities by density-independent adult mortality, whereas populations in the K-selection environment were maintained at their carrying capacity. Some of the experimental results support the predictions or r- and K-selection theory; relative to the r-selected populations, the K-selected populations evolved an increased larval-to-adult viability, larger body size, and longer development time at high larval densities. Mueller and Ayala (1981) found that K-selected populations also have a higher rate of population growth at high densities. Other predictions of the thoery are contradicted by the lack of differences between the r and K populations in adult longevity and fecundity and a slower rate of development for r-selected individuals at low densities. The differences between selected populations in larval survivorship, larval-to-adult development time, and adult body size are strongly dependent on larval density, and there is a significant interaction between populations and larval density for each trait. This manifests an inadequacy of the theory on r- and K-selection, which does not take into account such interactions between genotypes and environments. We describe mechanisms that may explain the evolution of preadult life-history traits in our experiment and discuss the need for changes in theories of density-dependent selection.",1989,"Todd J Bierbaum, Francisco J Ayala, Laurence D Mueller"
Extrachromosomal circular DNAs in Drosophila melanogaster: comparison between embryos and Kc0% cells,2510979,10.1007/BF00329684,"We established the size distribution of extrachromosomal covalently closed circular DNA molecules from embryos of various Drosophila melanogaster strains and from Kc0% tissue culture cells.

The Kc0% cell distribution differs mainly from that of embryos in that 48% of the molecules have a size between 4 and 8 kb. Correlating with this, circular molecules homologous to copia, 412 and 297 were detected only in Kc0% cells. The three tandemly repeated families containing the 5S genes, the histone genes and the 240 bp repeat of the ribosomal DNA intergenic spacer, which had previously been identified in circular DNAs from embryos, were also found in cultured cells. A fourth tandemly repeated family corresponding to the 1.688 g/cm3 satellite DNA was detected, both in embryos and Kc0% cells. It consists of circular multimeric molecules containing multiple copies of the 359 bp repeated unit. No circular DNA molecules homologous to the actin genes, the type I ribosomal DNA insertion, or the F and I transposable elements were found in embryos or Kc0% cells.

A chromosomal analysis showed that both the second and third chromosomes act additively on pupation distance and that the third pair of chromosomes had a much larger effect than the second. Significant variability exists in the distance D. melanogaster larvae pupate from fruit in nature. This phenotypic variation results from both heritable variation and variation from environmental sources. When the moisture content of the environment surrounding food is modified, gene by environment interactions also contribute to variation in the phenotype.

Here we report studies of cell cycle control in the imaginal tissues of Drosophila melanogaster, specifically in situations where cell cycle progression is regulated by varying the length of the G2 phase. We show that G2-phase arrest in late larval wing imaginal disks requires transcriptional control of stg, a mitotic inducer that encodes a D. melanogaster homologue of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe p80cdc25 phosphatase. In a second study, string transcriptional regulation was also shown to be important for G2-phase regulation in eye disk cells posterior to the morphogenetic furrow. Finally, unlike all other situations described to date, string transcriptional regulation was found not to be the cause of G2 arrest in abdominal histoblasts, these cells being refractory to ectopic expression of stg. This study further establishes string as an important regulator of G2 phase during D. melanogaster development, but also reveals that at least one additional mechanism is utilized to control G2-phase length and thus cell proliferation in different developmental contexts.",1997,"R Saint, P Kylsten"
Translational repressor bruno plays multiple roles in development and is widely conserved,9334316,10.1101/gad.11.19.2510,"oskar (osk) mRNA is tightly localized to the posterior pole of the Drosophila oocyte, where the subsequent expression of Osk protein directs abdomen and germ-line formation in the developing embryo. Misplaced expression of Osk protein leads to lethal body patterning defects. The Osk message is translationally repressed before and during the localization process, ensuring that Osk protein is only expressed after the mRNA has reached the posterior. An ovarian protein, Bruno (Bru), has been implicated as a translational repressor of osk mRNA. Here we report the isolation of a cDNA encoding Bru using a novel approach to the expression cloning of an RNA-binding protein, and the identification of previously described mutants in the arrest (aret)-locus as mutants in Bru. The mutant phenotype, along with the binding properties of the protein and its pattern of accumulation within the oocyte, indicate that Bru regulates multiple mRNAs involved in female and male gametogenesis as well as early in embryogenesis. Genetic experiments provide further evidence that Bru functions in the translational repression of osk. Intriguingly, we find that Bru interacts physically with Vasa (Vas), an RNA helicase that is a positive regulator of osk translation. Bru belongs to an evolutionarily conserved family of genes, suggesting that Bru-mediated translational regulation may be widespread.

No defect in the visual modality has been observed for the five mutants affected in the initiation of courtship. The mutant blocked at attempted copulation lacks the 'on' and 'off' transients, but this appears to be due to genetic background rather than the mutation itself.

Besides a decreased sensitivity to halothane, all mutant alleles of this locus cause a characteristic walking behavior in the absence of anesthetics. We have quantified this behavior using a geotaxis apparatus. Responses of the mutant alleles to different inhalational anesthetics were tested. The results strongly favor a multipathway model for the onset of anesthesia. Mosaic flies were tested for their response to halothane and checked for their abnormal walking behavior. The analysis suggests that both the behaviors are exhibited only by such mosaics as have the entire head of mutant origin. It is likely that this focus represents an element of a common pathway in the anesthetic response to several inhalational anesthetics but not all.

Analysis of metabolic phenotypes (fat and glycogen contents, enzyme activities, total protein, and body weight) of the resulting nine genotypes provides direct estimates of additive, dominance, and epistatic effects of the mutations. Nested two-way analysis of variance identified significant epistatic effects in 27% of the tests (35/128 of the trait x P-element combinations). Posterior contrasts were performed to partition the epistatic variance into the four orthogonal components of COCKERHAM, and the data exhibit a tendency toward additive x dominance and dominance x dominance epistasis.

Role of decapentaplegic in initiation and progression of the morphogenetic furrow in the developing Drosophila retina,9053331,,"Morphogenesis in the Drosophila retina initiates at the posterior margin of the eye imaginal disc by an unknown mechanism. Upon initiation, a wave of differentiation, its forward edge marked by the morphogenetic furrow (MF), proceeds anteriorly across the disc. Progression of the MF is driven by hedgehog (hh), expressed by differentiating photoreceptor cells. The TGF-beta homolog encoded by decapentaplegic (dpp) is expressed at the disc's posterior margin prior to initiation and in the furrow, under the control of hh, during MF progression. While dpp has been implicated in eye disc growth and morphogenesis, its precise role in retinal differentiation has not been determined. To address the role of dpp in initiation and progression of retinal differentiation we analyzed the consequences of reduced and increased dpp function during eye development. We find that dpp is not only required for normal MF initiation, but is sufficient to induce ectopic initiation of differentiation. Inappropriate initiation is normally inhibited by wingless (wg). Loss of dpp function is accompanied by expansion of wg expression, while increased dpp function leads to loss of wg transcription. In addition, dpp is required to maintain, and sufficient to induce, its own expression along the disc's margins. We postulate that dpp autoregulation and dpp-mediated inhibition of wg expression are required for the coordinated regulation of furrow initiation and progression. Finally, we show that in the later stages of retinal differentiation, reduction of dpp function leads to an arrest in MF progression.",1997,"U Heberlein, F Chanut"

In this study, we investigated how the adjacent primordia of the compound eye and dorsal head vertex are specified. We show that the genes wingless (wg) and orthodenticle (otd) are expressed throughout the entire second instar eye-antennal disc, conferring a default fate of dorsal vertex cuticle. Activation of decapentaplegic (dpp) expression in the posterior eye disc eliminates wg and otd expression, thereby permitting eye differentiation. We also demonstrate that otd is activated by wg in the vertex primordium.

The receptor is coupled directly to the generation of a rapid, transient intracellular Ca2+ signal, monitored as changes in inward current mediated by the oocyte endogenous Ca2+-activated chloride channel, by a pertussis toxin-insensitive G-protein-coupled pathway. The more prolonged receptor-mediated changes in adenylyl cyclase activity are generated by an independent G-protein-coupled pathway that is pertussis toxin-sensitive but calcium-independent, and Gbetagamma-subunits appear to be involved in the transduction of this response. This is the first evidence for the direct coupling of a cloned D1-like dopamine receptor both to the activation of adenylyl cyclase and to the initiation of an intracellular Ca2+ signal. The pharmacological profile of both second messenger effects is identical for a range of naturally occurring catecholamine ligands (dopamine > norepinephrine > epinephrine) and for the blockade of dopamine responses by a range of synthetic antagonists. However, the pharmacological profiles of the two second messenger responses differ for a range of synthetic agonists. Thus, the receptor exhibits agonist-specific coupling to second messenger systems for synthetic agonists. This feature could provide a useful tool in the genetic analysis of the roles of the multiple second messenger pathways activated by this receptor, given the likely involvement of dopamine in the processes of learning and memory in the insect nervous system.",1997,"P D Evans, F Hannan, V Reale, L M Hall"
Structural analysis of Drosophila subobscura gypsy elements (gypsyDs),9440257,,"The study of gypsy elements in Drosophila subobscura (gypsyDs) indicated that they are transcriptionally active and mobile. From the comparative analysis of a complete gypsyDs element with the canonical gypsy sequence from D. melanogaster (gypsyDm) it can be deduced that while the whole structure is maintained, the gypsyDs ORF3 encodes a non-functional Env protein. The PCR amplification and sequencing of the ORF3 from different laboratory strains and H271 clones show that all gypsyDs sequences studied have frame-shifting mutations in this region. These results support that gypsyDs elements lack functional Env proteins and consequently they lack infective ability. In this way, it can be proposed that gypsyDs elements are degenerate forms of insect retroviruses. Heterogeneous results have been obtained in the study of the presence of gypsyDm sequences in different D. subobscura strains indicating that these sequences are unstable in this species.",1997,"L Bori, R de Frutos, T M Alberola"
Insect circadian rhythms and photoperiodism,9783440,10.1007/BF02480370,"Two clock-controlled processes, overt circadian rhythmicity and the photoperiodic induction of diapause, are described in the blow fly, Calliphora vicina and the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Circadian locomotor rhythms of the adult flies reflect endogenous, self-sustained oscillations with a temperature compensated period. The free-running rhythms become synchronised (entrained) to daily light:dark cycles, but become arrhythmic in constant light above a certain intensity. Some flies show fragmented rhythms (internal desynchronisation) suggesting that overt rhythmicity is the product of a multioscillator (multicellular) system. Photoperiodic induction of larval diapause in C. vicina and of ovarian diapause in D. melanogaster is also based on the circadian system but seems to involve a separate mechanism at both the molecular and neuronal levels. For both processes in both species, the compound eyes and ocelli are neither essential nor necessary for photic entrainment, and the circadian clock mechanism is not within the optic lobes. The central brain is the most likely site for both rhythm generation and extra-optic photoreception. In D. melanogaster, a group of lateral brain neurons has been identified as important circadian pacemaker cells, which are possibly also photo-sensitive. Similar lateral brain neurons, staining for arrestin, a protein in the phototransduction 'cascade' and a selective marker for photoreceptors in both vertebrates and invertebrates, have been identified in C. vicina. Much less is known about the cellular substrate of the photoperiodic mechanism, but this may involve the pars intercerebralis region of the mid-brain.",1997,D S Saunders
Modelling the activity of the Ultrabithorax parasegment-specific regulatory domains around their anterior boundaries,9278718,10.1006/jtbi.1996.0368,"The Drosophila Ultrabithorax (Ubx) gene was one of the first homeotic genes to be characterised and it specifies the phenotypic characteristics of parasegments 5 and 6. The intricate pattern of Ubx expression in these parasegments is conferred by enormous regulatory regions which, together with the structural gene, constitute the Ubx domain. A genetic, ""open-for-business"", model based on classical mutational analysis proposed that the regulatory regions were in fact composite structures, consisting of parasegment-specific regulatory domains that contain arrays of cell-specific enhancers which drive the intricate pattern of Ubx expression. Here, we propose a molecular mechanism, based on a survey of numerous transgenic studies, of the setting up of these parasegment-specific regulatory domains in the appropriate parts of the late blastoderm embryo. We construct a mathematical model of this mechanism using the molecular characteristics of a single initiator element, the distributions of segmentation gene products and simple competitive binding equations. We attempt to fit this mathematical model to the idealised patterns of activity and closure of the parasegment-specific domains derived from the genetic model. The resulting fitted pattern of activity and closure obtained with the simplest version of our competitive binding model shows some deviations from the idealised pattern based on the genetic model. Comparison of the predictions with recent experimental evidence suggests that the competitive binding model more accurately reflects certain features of the Ubx expression pattern--features not predicted by the genetic model.",1997,"P B Singh, D Brown"
Cell-specific expression and heat-shock induction of Hsps during spermatogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster,9378751,,"The developmental and heat-shock-induced expression of two small heat-shock proteins (Hsp23 and Hsp27) was investigated during spermatogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster. Both of these Hsps were expressed in unstressed and stressed male gonads as shown by immunoblotting. Immunostaining of whole-mount organs and thin sections of testes showed that an anti-Hsp23 antibody specifically decorated cells of the somatic lineage, such as the cyst cells and the epithelial cells of the testis and of the seminal vesicle. Hsp27 was expressed in some somatic cells (cyst cells and epithelial cells of the accessory glands) and, in addition, was also visible in the maturing spermatocytes of the germline. The same cell-specific pattern of expression was observed after heat shock, and cells which did not express Hsp23 and Hsp27 in the absence of stress were similarly unable to mount a heat shock response for these s-Hsps. However other Hsps such as Hsp70 and Hsp22 were induced under heat-shock conditions in testes. Actinomycin D prevented the heat-induced accumulation of these Hsps indicating that the induction of Hsps was regulated at the transcriptional level. The heat shock transcriptional factor of Drosophila (DmHSF), present in significantly lower amount in testes when compared to other tissues such as the head, was shown to be required for the heat activation of Hsp22 and Hsp70. Immunostaining revealed that HSF expression was restricted to specific cells such as cyst cells, epithelial pigment cells, spermatogonia and spermatids but not the primary spermatocytes. These data show that the expression and induction of the different small Hsps is regulated in a cell-specific manner under both normal and heat shock conditions and suggest that factors other than the DmHSF are involved in this regulation in male gonads.",1997,"S Michaud, R Marin, J T Westwood, R M Tanguay"
Mothers against dpp participates in a DDP/TGF-beta responsive serine-threonine kinase signal transduction cascade,9272957,,"Mothers against dpp (Mad) is the prototype of a family of genes required for signaling by TGF-beta related ligands. In Drosophila, Mad is specifically required in cells responding to Decapentaplegic (DPP) signals. We further specify the role of Mad in DPP-mediated signaling by utilizing tkvQ199D, an activated form of the DPP type I receptor serine-threonine kinase thick veins (tkv). In the embryonic midgut, tkvQ199D mimics DPP-mediated inductive interactions. Homozygous Mad mutations block signaling by tkvQ199D. Appropriate responses to signaling by tkvQ199D are restored by expression of MAD protein in DPP-target cells. Endogenous MAD is phosphorylated in a ligand-dependent manner in Drosophila cell culture. DPP overexpression in the embryonic midgut induces MAD nuclear accumulation; after withdrawal of the overexpressed DPP signal, MAD is detected only in the cytoplasm. However, in three different tissues and developmental stages actively responding to endogenous DPP, MAD protein is detected in the cytoplasm but not in the nucleus. From these observations, we discuss possible roles for MAD in a DPP-dependent serine-threonine kinase signal transduction cascade integral to the proper interpretation of DPP signals.",1997,"J L Wrana, L Attisano, S J Newfeld, A Mehra, W M Gelbart, M A Singer"
"Cloning and characterization of an essential Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene, TAF40, which encodes yTAFII40, an RNA polymerase II-specific TATA-binding protein-associated factor",9083082,10.1074/jbc.272.14.9436,"In this report we describe the cloning and initial characterization of TAF40, a gene that encodes a yeast TATA-binding protein-associated factor (yTAF) of Mr = approximately 40,000. This gene has many similarities to other yTAFs described thus far in that it is present at a single copy per haploid genome, it is essential for viability, and the deduced protein sequence of yTAF40 exhibits similarity to previously described human and Drosophila TAFIIs. Immunological studies confirm that yTAF40 protein is a subunit of a large multiprotein TATA-binding protein-TAF complex that contains a subset of the total number of the yTAFs present in yeast cell extracts. Transcription reactions performed using yeast whole cell extracts reveal that of the three nuclear RNA polymerases only RNA polymerase II function is abrogated when yTAF40 and associated proteins are immunodepleted from solution, indicating that the functionality of the multiprotein complex containing yTAF40 is RNA polymerase II-specific. By these criteria yTAF40 appears to encode a bona fide RNA polymerase II-specific TAF, and thus the protein that it encodes has been termed yTAFII40.",1997,"S Zhou, P A Weil, E R Klebanow, D Poon"
Cerebellar deficient folia (cdf): a new mutation on mouse chromosome 6,9060409,10.1007/s003359900368,"Cerebellar deficient folia, cdf, is a spontaneous autosomal recessive mutation in the mouse with unique pathology; the cerebellar cortex of the cdf/cdf mouse has only 7 folia instead of 10, which is the normal count for the C3H/HeJ strain in which this mutation arose. The cerebellum of the cdf/cdf mouse is hypoplastic and contains mineral deposits in the ventral vermis that are not present in controls. We used an intersubspecific intercross between C3H/HeSnJ-cdf/+ and Mus musculus castaneus (CAST/Ei) to map the cdf mutation to Chromosome (Chr) 6. The most likely gene order is D6Mit16-(cdf, D6Mit3)-D6Mit70-D6Mit29-D6Mit32, which positions cdf distal to lurcher (Lc) and proximal to motor neuron degeneration 2 (mnd2). The definitive visible phenotypes and histopathologies of cdf, Lc, and mnd2 support our mapping evidence that cdf is a distinct gene.

Directed alterations of the X-chromosomal ribosomal gene repeats in mutant sc8 of Drosophila melanogaster,9465408,10.1023/a:1018347515588,"The patterns of the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) repeat units in seven Drosophila melanogaster inversional mutants have been studied. Among them, only the In(1)sc8 and its deletional derivative Df(1)mal12 female rDNAs exhibited significant reduction in the size of nearly all units, compared to the wild-type females (Canton S, Oregon R). Further investigation shows that each kind of repeat (insertion-free, insertion-containing) in the Xsc8 rDNA array is highly enriched with short (reduced to 4 kilobases) intergenic spacers (IGSs). We revealed two main types of rearrangements. Only part of the 4 kb IGSs display variable length deletions (0.2-0.6 kb) at the 5' ends, within the so-called '1900' base pair (bp) region, recognizable by restriction endonuclease AluI. The presence of additional 100-150 bp DNA in the start portion of this region has also been demonstrated. In contrast, the 3' end spacer regions, corresponding to the external transcribed spacer, do not show any changes in size. These data indicate how reductions of approximately 1.1 kb DNAs in sc8 IGSs, carrying both the rearranged and non-rearranged '1900' sequences, are achieved: the fixed decrease of a number of 240 bp AluI subrepeats, clustered in the central IGS portion, also contribute. None of the other similar inversional mutants examined has so many IGS variants. Therefore, alterations in the Xsc8 rRNA gene cluster seem not to be dependent on its inversional status.",1997,"B Markova, E P Semionov"

A new enhancer of position-effect variegation in Drosophila melanogaster encodes a putative RNA helicase that binds chromosomes and is regulated by the cell cycle,9215899,,"In Drosophila melanogaster, position-effect variegation of the white gene has been a useful phenomenon by which to study chromosome structure and the genes that modify it. We have identified a new enhancer of variegation locus, Dmrnahel (hel). Deletion of mutation of hel enhances white variegation, and this can be reversed by a transformed copy of hel+. In the presence of two endogenous copies, the transformed hel+ behaves as a suppressor of variegation. hel is an essential gene and functions both maternally and zygotically. The HEL protein is similar to known RNA helicases, but contains an unusual variant (DECD) of the DEAD motif common to these proteins. Potential HEL homologues have been found in mammals, yeast and worms. HEL protein associates with salivary gland chromosomes and locates to nuclei of embryos and ovaries, but disappears in mitotic domains of embryos as chromosomes condense. We propose that the HEL protein promotes an open chromatin structure that favors transcription during development by regulating the spread of heterochromatin, and that HEL is regulated by, and may have a role in, the mitotic cell cycle during embryogenesis.",1997,"P Lasko, V Sood, L J Lorenz, N Perrimon, M B Melnick, D F Eberl"
A characteristic arrangement of aromatic amino acid residues in the solution structure of the amino-terminal RNA-binding domain of Drosophila sex-lethal,9299339,10.1006/jmbi.1997.1213,"The Sex-lethal (Sxl) protein from Drosophila melanogaster has two RNA-binding domains (RBDs). As the amino-terminal RBD (RBD1) of the Sxl protein exhibits low sequence homology to the typical RBDs, particularly at the putative functional residues, it was difficult to unambiguously locate the RNP1 and RNP2 motifs. Therefore, in the present study, we defined the amino and carboxy-terminal borders of the first RNA-binding domain (RBD1) of the Sxl protein by limited tryptic digestion. By replacement of Phe166 by Tyr, we constructed a highly soluble mutant, which exhibits the same RNA-binding properties as those of the wild-type. Using this mutant protein, we performed NMR measurements, and elucidated the secondary and tertiary structures of the Sxl RBD1 in solution. The betaalphabetabetaalphabeta folding pattern is conserved in the solution structure of the Sxl RBD1, as in other reported RBD structures. This allowed us to identify both the RNP1 and RNP2 motifs of the Sxl RBD1 unambiguously. Intriguingly, the RNP2 motif of the Sxl RBD1 has an Ile residue at the second position, which is generally occupied by an aromatic amino acid residue in RBDs and has been suggested to be involved in their RNA binding. Furthermore, the loop region between beta2 and beta3 of the Sxl RBD1 has an exceptional cluster of aromatic amino acid residues, in place of the normal basic amino acid cluster. In contrast, the second RBD of Sxl does not exhibit these characteristic features.",1997,"K Takio, Y Shimura, M Inoue, Y Muto, T Kigawa, S Yokoyama, H Sakamoto"
Multiple RNA regulatory elements mediate distinct steps in localization of oskar mRNA,8275853,,"Pattern formation in the early development of many organisms relies on localized cytoplasmic proteins, which can be prelocalized as mRNAs. The Drosophila oskar gene, required both for posterior body patterning and germ cell determination, encodes one such mRNA. Localization of oskar mRNA is an elaborate process involving movement of the transcript first into the oocyte from adjacent interconnected nurse cells and then across the length of the oocyte to its posterior pole. We have mapped RNA regulatory elements that direct this localization. Using a hybrid lacZ/oskar mRNA, we identify several elements within the oskar 3' untranslated region that affect different steps in the process: the early movement into the oocyte, accumulation at the anterior margin of the oocyte and finally localization to the posterior pole. This use of multiple cis-acting elements suggests that localization may be orchestrated in a combinatorial fashion, thereby allowing localized mRNAs with ultimately different destinations to employ common mechanisms for shared intermediate steps.",1993,"J Kim-Ha, J L Smith, P J Webster, P M Macdonald"
CONSERVATION OF MOLECULAR PREPATTERNS DURING THE EVOLUTION OF CUTICLE MORPHOLOGY IN DROSOPHILA LARVAE,28564885,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1993.tb02162.x,"We are using patterns of cuticle specialization in Drosophila larvae as models to investigate the molecular, genetic, and developmental bases of morphological evolution. Members of the virilis species group differ markedly from one another in the distribution of hairs on the dorsal surface of first instar larvae. In particular, characteristic bands of hairs cover about 20% of each trunk segment in some species but about 70% in others. These major types do not correlate with recently proposed phylogenetic relationships, suggesting that similar phenotypes have arisen independently in different lineages. The patterns of expression of several genes that control or reflect intrasegmental patterning are indistinguishable in species with very different cuticle morphologies. We conclude that, in this case, morphology probably has evolved via altered response to a conserved molecular prepattern.",1993,"W J Dickinson, Kim Schuske, Yifan Yang, Michael Akam"
An immunocytochemical study of the FMRFamide neuropeptide gene products in Drosophila,8282851,10.1002/cne.903370308,"We have mapped protein expression of the FMRFamide neuropeptide gene in Drosophila with polyclonal antisera against three small peptides whose sequences were derived from the Drosophila proFMRFamide precursor. One antiserum was affinity-purified and extensively characterized. The enriched antibodies labeled 15-21 bilaterally symmetric pairs of neurons in a pattern that corresponded very closely to the pattern of in situ hybridization that was determined previously (Schneider et al. [1991] J. Comp. Neurol. 304:608-622; O'Brien et al. [1991] J. Comp. Neurol. 304:623-638). The other antisera produced complementary results. These findings suggest that the antisera specifically label cells that express the FMRFamide gene. In larvae we consistently observed strong staining in identified interneurons and neuroendocrine cells, and moderate to weak staining in neurons of unknown function. The adult pattern of expression included both larval neurons whose immunoreactivity persisted through metamorphosis and adult-specific neurons. During metamorphosis, we observed transient staining in a small number of neurons and in specific neuropil regions that included the central body, the protocerebral bridge, and the optic ganglia. Based on these morphological features, we suggest that the FMRFamide-like neuropeptides in Drosophila play a number of functional roles, perhaps affecting both physiological and developmental phenomena. Such roles include general modulation throughout all post-embryonic stages, via the blood, and also more stage- and region-specific modulation within the CNS.",1993,"D J Garland, P H Taghert, E T Sun, L E Schneider"
Drosophila melanogaster male germ line-specific transcripts with autosomal and Y-linked genes,8514138,,"We have identified of set of related transcripts expressed in the germ line of male Drosophila melanogaster. Surprisingly, while one of the corresponding genes is autosomal the remainder are located on the Y chromosome. The autosomal locus, at 77F on chromosome arm 3L, corresponds to the previously described transcription unit 18c, located in the first intron of the gene for an RI subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The Y chromosome copies have been mapped to region h18-h19 on the cytogenetic map of the Y outside of any of the regions required for male fertility. In contrast to D. melanogaster, where Y-linked copies were found in nine different wild-type strains, no Y-linked copies were found in sibling species. Several apparently Y-derived cDNA clones and one Y-linked genomic clone have been sequenced. The Y-derived genomic DNA shares the same intron/exon structure as the autosomal copy as well as related flanking sequences suggesting that it transposed to the Y from the autosomal locus. However, this particular Y-linked copy cannot encode a functional polypeptide due to a stop codon at amino acid position 72. Divergence among five different cDNA clones ranges from 1.5 to 6% and includes a large number of third position substitutions. We have not yet obtained a full-length cDNA from a Y-linked gene and therefore cannot conclude that the D. melanogaster Y chromosome contains functional protein-coding genes. The autosomal gene encodes a predicted polypeptide with 45% similarity to histones of the H5 class and more limited similarity to cysteine-rich protamines.

Larval development time, light and temperature also affect pupation height but there are intra- and interspecific variations in response to these factors for pupation site preference.

This increase becomes apparent 2 to 3 h after the short H2O2 treatment. It is inhibited if actinomycin D is present during the short H2O2 treatment. An increase of actin synthesis was also observed during the recovery period after two other stresses: reoxygenation after anoxia and ethanol treatment. The synthesis of two cytoskeletal proteins, tubulin and a 46-kDa insoluble protein of the intermediate filament fraction, was also slightly increased by H2O2 in Drosophila cells, but this increase was not actinomycin D-dependent. H2O2 does not provoke the translocation of the 46-kDa protein to the nuclear fraction as does heat shock.

We describe three mutations, grapes, scrambled, and nuclear-fallout, which define three previously uncharacterized genes. Females homozygous for these mutations produce embryos that exhibit extensive mitotic division errors only after the nuclei migrate to the surface. Analysis of the microfilament and microtubule organization in embryos derived from these newly identified mutations reveal disruptions in the cortical cytoskeleton.

Homeotic genes autonomously specify one aspect of pattern in the Drosophila mesoderm,8096627,10.1038/362630a0,"Transplantation and ablation experiments have led to the generalization that in insects the mesoderm is naive, and that pattern is imposed upon it by the ectoderm. This has been demonstrated directly by mosaic analysis for the case of one muscle in Drosophila. The unique character of this muscle depends on the activity of sex-determining and homeotic genes, not in the muscle itself, but in the nerve that innervates it. Indirect evidence suggests, however, that homeotic genes specify some aspects of mesoderm patterning autonomously. Homeotic genes are expressed in the mesoderm, and are regulated in a segment-specific pattern analogous to, but different from, that seen in the ectoderm. Moreover, the effects of homeotic mutations on the muscles do not always mirror transformations seen in the epidermis. Here we examine this problem directly, by expressing homeotic genes ectopically in the mesoderm without altering their expression in the overlying ectoderm. We find that the pattern of adult muscle precursor cells characteristic of the thorax can be converted to that seen in the abdomen by expressing the homeotic gene abdominal-A specifically in the mesoderm.",1993,"M Akam, S Greig"

On the basis of the location of the duplication breakpoints and the restriction sites flanking these breakpoints, this duplication probably arose through nonhomologous recombination involving either a breakage and rejoining event or replication slippage. because documented cases of intraspecific gene duplication polymorphism are rare, the D. virilis UO duplication will be useful in identifying the molecular event giving rise to a gene duplication.",1993,"J Burnett, S Lootens, T B Friedman"
"Identification of an essential gene, l(3)73Ai, with a dominant temperature-sensitive lethal allele, encoding a Drosophila proteasome subunit",8415617,10.1073/pnas.90.19.8842,"Proteasomes are multicatalytic proteinase complexes that function as a major nonlysosomal proteolytic system in all eukaryotes. These particles are made up of 13-15 nonidentical subunits, and they exhibit multiple endopeptidase activities that promote the intracellular turnover of abnormal polypeptides and short-lived regulatory proteins. Although the biochemical characterization of proteasomes has been quite extensive, and although a number of the genes encoding proteasome subunits have been cloned from various organisms, there is still much to be learned about their function in vivo and what role(s) they might play during development. Here, we report the identification of the l(3)73Ai1 allele of Drosophila melanogaster as a dominant temperature-sensitive lethal mutation in a gene encoding a component of the proteasome, thus opening the way for future genetic and developmental studies on this important proteolytic system in a higher eukaryote.",1993,"J M Belote, K J Saville"
Oviposition site preference in four species of Drosophila,8359855,,"Oviposition site preference which is an important aspect of nonsexual behaviour of adult females was studied in four species of Drosophila, viz. D. ananassae, D. bipectinata, D. malerkotliana and D. biarmipes. The number of eggs laid by females in food vials was counted for 20 days. In each species, eggs were counted in both central and peripheral areas of culture medium. Eggs were also separated into two groups: deposited on the surface of food medium and inserted into the surface of culture medium. Greater proportion of eggs was oviposited in peripheral area of food medium and were inserted into the surface of the medium by females of all the four species. However, there are interspecies variations with respect to oviposition site preference. Further, these species show variation with respect to total fecundity. D. ananassae lays maximum number of eggs whereas D. biarmipes shows lowest rate of fecundity.",1993,"T Srivastava, B N Singh"
Absence of prohibitin gene mutations in human epithelial ovarian tumors,8349162,10.1006/gyno.1993.1160,"Multiple loss of heterozygosity (LOH) studies of ovarian cancers have found a high incidence of chromosome 17 loss in these tumors. Several authors have suggested that the region commonly deleted encompasses 17q12-21. In addition, this region has recently been reported to be linked to the familial breast/ovarian cancer syndrome. Recently the human prohibitin gene was mapped to region 17q12-22. Prohibitin causes arrest of DNA synthesis by fibroblast and HeLa cells and prohibitin shows significant homology to a gene (Cc) thought to be important for the regulation of development of Drosophila melanogaster. These findings have led many to consider the prohibitin gene a potential tumor suppressor gene. In addition, sequence analysis of exon 4 of human prohibitin gene revealed mutations in 4 of 23 sporadic breast carcinomas. Because of the proposed function for prohibitin, its alterations in breast cancers, and the fact that its location on 17q falls within a commonly deleted region in ovarian cancers, we have undertaken an analysis of the sequence of prohibitin in epithelial ovarian cancers. Using several polymorphic DNA probes, we identified 20 epithelial ovarian tumors which demonstrated LOH for the region that contains the prohibitin gene. To evaluate whether mutations of prohibitin may be important in ovarian carcinogenesis, we have sequenced exons 4 and 5 of this gene using the technique of genomic amplification with transcript sequencing. Only normal exon 4 and 5 sequence was observed among the 20 tumors screened. These results demonstrate that this region of the prohibitin gene is not mutated in epithelial ovarian cancers and suggest that the prohibitin gene does not play a role in ovarian carcinogenesis. Sequencing of further exons and introns are needed to confirm this latter hypothesis.",1993,"R B Jenkins, W Cliby, K C Podratz, G Sarkar, S R Ritland, L Hartmann"
Puffs and PCR: the in vivo dynamics of early gene expression during ecdysone responses in Drosophila,8223281,,"The steroid hormone ecdysone orchestrates insect development by regulating gene networks. In Drosophila the most detailed description of ecdysone action is the sequential activation of early and late puffs in the polytene chromosomes of the late larval salivary gland. A number of these early puffs (2B5, 74EF and 75B) contain complex transcription units (Broad-Complex, E74 and E75 respectively) encoding families of regulatory proteins which are expressed in most if not all tissues. In vitro, transcripts of the different isoforms of these early genes as well as the ecdysone receptor (EcR) present varying dose response characteristics (Karim and Thummel, 1992, EMBO J. 11, 4083-4093). We have developed an in vivo approach using a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay (RT-PCR) so as to visualise these transcripts in the RNA extracted from a single salivary gland. Using one salivary gland lobe for developmental puff staging and the sister lobe for RT-PCR, we have obtained precise developmental profiles for these transcripts and have extended our study to other tissues and stages where puffing studies were not possible. In the salivary gland we have characterised three distinct ecdysone responses. For the mid and late third larval instar responses our results confirm and extend the conclusions of the in vitro studies concerning the temporal expression of the early gene isoforms. The relatively brief prepupal response contains elements in common with each of the larval responses and all three can be explained by the profiles of the respective ecdysone peaks. Interestingly EcR transcripts respond differently during each response. The analysis of different tissues of the same animal reveals subtle differences in the timing of the ecdysone response and isoform expression and suggests that this may reflect tissue differences in the ecdysone profiles. As these molecules have homologues in vertebrates, our analysis may have general implications for the organisation of hormonal responses in vivo.",1993,"C Ruiz, G Richards, F Huet"

Two tandem repeats downstream of this transcription unit reiterate divergent copies of the third exon and flanking regions. Comparisons of these three repeats with respect to nucleotide base substitutions and deletions or insertions show clearly that they arose via a duplication and subsequent crossing-over between misaligned copies.

It is found that 4(R)-substituted analogues are more potent than their 4(S)-isomers in interacting with L-glutamate receptors both at porcine brain synaptic junctions and on drosophila muscles. This demonstrates that the ligand recognition site of L-glutamate receptors has chiral selectivity discriminating L-glutamate analogues with bulky 4(R)- and 4(S)-substituent groups.,1993,"Y S Hon, W Y Chow, C M Wang, P Y Cheng, T A Lin, Y C Chang"
The conserved ADAMTS-like protein lonely heart mediates matrix formation and cardiac tissue integrity,23874219,10.1371/journal.pgen.1003616,"Here we report on the identification and functional characterization of the ADAMTS-like homolog lonely heart (loh) in Drosophila melanogaster. Loh displays all hallmarks of ADAMTSL proteins including several thrombospondin type 1 repeats (TSR1), and acts in concert with the collagen Pericardin (Prc). Loss of either loh or prc causes progressive cardiac damage peaking in the abolishment of heart function. We show that both proteins are integral components of the cardiac ECM mediating cellular adhesion between the cardiac tube and the pericardial cells. Loss of ECM integrity leads to an altered myo-fibrillar organization in cardiac cells massively influencing heart beat pattern. We show evidence that Loh acts as a secreted receptor for Prc and works as a crucial determinant to allow the formation of a cell and tissue specific ECM, while it does not influence the accumulation of other matrix proteins like Nidogen or Perlecan. Our findings demonstrate that the function of ADAMTS-like proteins is conserved throughout evolution and reveal a previously unknown interaction of these proteins with collagens.",2013,"Maik Drechsler, Ariane C Schmidt, Achim Paululat, Heiko Meyer"
Inter-leg coordination in the control of walking speed in Drosophila,23038731,10.1242/jeb.078139,"Legged locomotion is the most common behavior of terrestrial animals and it is assumed to have become highly optimized during evolution. Quadrupeds, for instance, use distinct gaits that are optimal with regard to metabolic cost and have characteristic kinematic features and patterns of inter-leg coordination. In insects, the situation is not as clear. In general, insects are able to alter inter-leg coordination systematically with locomotion speed, producing a continuum of movement patterns. This notion, however, is based on the study of several insect species, which differ greatly in size and mass. Each of these species tends to walk at a rather narrow range of speeds. We have addressed these issues by examining four strains of Drosophila, which are similar in size and mass, but tend to walk at different speed ranges. Our data suggest that Drosophila controls its walking speed almost exclusively via step frequency. At high walking speeds, we invariably found tripod coordination patterns, the quality of which increased with speed as indicated by a simple measure of tripod coordination strength (TCS). At low speeds, we also observed tetrapod coordination and wave gait-like walking patterns. These findings not only suggest a systematic speed dependence of inter-leg movement patterns but also imply that inter-leg coordination is flexible. This was further supported by amputation experiments in which we examined walking behavior in animals after the removal of a hindleg. These animals show immediate adaptations in body posture, leg kinematics and inter-leg coordination, thereby maintaining their ability to walk.",2013,"Anne Wosnitza, Henrike Scholz, Michael Dübbert, Ansgar Büschges, Till Bockemühl"

The XSPRING domain harbors an SP-RING zinc-finger, which is characteristic of proteins with SUMO E3 ligase activity. TnaA is required for homeotic gene expression and is presumably involved in the SUMOylation pathway. Here we analyzed some aspects of the TnaA location in embryo and larval stages and its genetic and biochemical interaction with SUMOylation pathway proteins. We describe that there are at least two TnaA proteins (TnaA130 and TnaA123) differentially expressed throughout development. We show that TnaA is chromatin-associated at discrete sites on polytene salivary gland chromosomes of third instar larvae and that tna mutant individuals do not survive to adulthood, with most dying as third instar larvae or pupae. The tna mutants that ultimately die as third instar larvae have an extended life span of at least 4 to 15 days as other SUMOylation pathway mutants. We show that TnaA physically interacts with the SUMO E2 conjugating enzyme Ubc9, and with the BRM complex subunit Osa. Furthermore, we show that tna and osa interact genetically with SUMOylation pathway components and individuals carrying mutations for these genes show a phenotype that can be the consequence of misexpression of developmental-related genes.",2013,"Lucía Gutiérrez-Aguiar, Martha Vázquez, R Alejandro Juárez-Uribe, Zoraya Palomera-Sánchez, Mario Zurita, Juan Monribot-Villanueva, James A Kennison"

Here we combine diet, genetics, and physiology to establish an adult Drosophila melanogaster model of chronic high sugar-induced heart disease. We demonstrate deterioration of heart function accompanied by fibrosis-like collagen accumulation, insulin signaling defects, and fat accumulation. The result was a shorter life span that was more severe in the presence of reduced insulin and P38 signaling. We provide evidence of a role for hexosamine flux, a metabolic pathway accessed by glucose. Increased hexosamine flux led to heart function defects and structural damage; conversely, cardiac-specific reduction of pathway activity prevented sugar-induced heart dysfunction. Our data establish Drosophila as a useful system for exploring specific aspects of diet-induced heart dysfunction and emphasize enzymes within the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway as candidate therapeutic targets.",2013,"Thomas J Baranski, Jay Pendse, Laura Palanker Musselman, Jianbo Na, Ross Cagan, Rolf Bodmer, Karen Ocorr"

This review summarizes the neurophysiology of the first two layers of this system: the peripheral olfactory receptor neurons and their postsynaptic targets in the antennal lobe. We now understand in some detail the cellular and synaptic mechanisms that shape odor representations in these neurons. Together, these mechanisms imply that interesting neural adaptations to environmental statistics have occurred. These mechanisms also place some fundamental constraints on early sensory processing that pose challenges for higher brain regions.

Tacrolimus enhances the potency of posaconazole against Rhizopus oryzae in vitro and in an experimental model of mucormycosis,23242544,10.1093/infdis/jis767,"Background: We hypothesized that tacrolimus, an inhibitor of the calcineurin pathway, would enhance the in vivo activity of posaconazole against Rhizopus oryzae, the Mucorales species most commonly associated with mucormycosis. Methods: We examined patterns of growth inhibition and fungicidal activity of posaconazole and tacrolimus, alone and in combination, against R. oryzae in vitro, using multiple methods (ie, hyphal metabolic and fluorescent vital dye reduction assays and measurement of chitin concentrations), and in vivo, using 2 mucormycosis models: an invertebrate model (Drosophila) and a nonlethal murine model of cutaneous mucormycosis. Results: Combinations of posaconazole and tacrolimus were synergistic in checkerboard assays for 4 clinical isolates of R. oryzae (48-hour fractional inhibitory concentration index, 0.187-0.281). Pharmacodynamic analysis of the combination revealed that the 90% effective concentration threshold of posaconazole activity against R. oryzae could be achieved with 2-fold lower drug concentrations (0.5-1 mg/L) when administered with tacrolimus (0.007-2 mg/L). In vivo, combination therapy was associated with improved survival in the fly model of mucormycosis (65% vs 57% posaconazole alone) and with significant reductions in cutaneous lesions and R. oryzae fungal burden, compared with animals that received posaconazole monotherapy, in the cutaneous model of mucormycosis.

Here, we have designed a multi-tiered, high-throughput pipeline that employs design-of-experiment methods to design a culture medium for wing discs. The resulting formula sustains high levels of proliferation for more than 12 hours. This approach results in a statistical model of proliferation as a function of extrinsic growth supplements and identifies synergies that improve insulin-stimulated growth. A more dynamic view of organogenesis emerges from the optimized culture system that highlights important facets of growth: spatiotemporal clustering of cell divisions and cell junction rearrangements.

In order to compare their effects on the locomotor activity of Drosophila adults, we made RNAi knockdown of the peptides and their specific receptor genes. In addition, we constructed Gal4 drivers with three distinct parts of the Fmrf gene's 5' regulatory sequence (RS8-Gal4, RS11-Gal4, RS17-Gal4), and used them to ablate FMRF-positive neurons inducing apoptosis by expressing the reaper (rpr) gene. We examined the locomotor activity of flies by measuring the mean velocity of movement (MVM) following repeated air-puffs. Locomotor activity was decreased by RNAi knockdown induced in the CNS by the elav-Gal4 driver. According to the MVM curve profiles, RNAi knockdown most effectively decreased the velocity when the DmsR-1 and DmsR-2 genes were silenced together (DmsR-1-RNAi/elav-Gal4; DmsR-2-RNAi/+). Similar effect was observed in Dsk-RNAi/ elav-Gal4; DskR-2-RNAi/+, while moderate effects were found in three other combinations (Fmrf-RNAi/elav-Gal4; FR-RNAi/+, Dms-RNAi/ elav-Gal4;DmsR-2-RNAi/+, CCKLR-17D1-RNAi/elav-Gal4; CCKLR-17D3-RNAi/+), and weak effect in DmsR-2-RNAi/elav-Gal4; DmsR-1-RNAi/+.

In the cell ablation experiment, the MVM profiles of the female flies were different from the controls when the UAS-rpr transgene was driven by RS8-Gal4 or RS17-Gal4. The RS11-Gal4 and Fmrf-Gal4 drivers were ineffective. In the males only the RS17-Gal4 showed a weak effect.

Evidence of a triosephosphate isomerase non-catalytic function crucial to behavior and longevity,23641070,10.1242/jcs.124586,"Triosephosphate isomerase (TPI) is a glycolytic enzyme that converts dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) into glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GAP). Glycolytic enzyme dysfunction leads to metabolic diseases collectively known as glycolytic enzymopathies. Of these enzymopathies, TPI deficiency is unique in the severity of neurological symptoms. The Drosophila sugarkill mutant closely models TPI deficiency and encodes a protein prematurely degraded by the proteasome. This led us to question whether enzyme catalytic activity was crucial to the pathogenesis of TPI sugarkill neurological phenotypes. To study TPI deficiency in vivo we developed a genomic engineering system for the TPI locus that enables the efficient generation of novel TPI genetic variants. Using this system we demonstrate that TPI sugarkill can be genetically complemented by TPI encoding a catalytically inactive enzyme.

Collective polarization model for gradient sensing via Dachsous-Fat intercellular signaling,24282293,10.1073/pnas.1307459110,"Dachsous-Fat signaling via the Hippo pathway influences proliferation during Drosophila development, and some of its mammalian homologs are tumor suppressors, highlighting its role as a universal growth regulator. The Fat/Hippo pathway responds to morphogen gradients and influences the in-plane polarization of cells and orientation of divisions, linking growth with tissue patterning. Remarkably, the Fat pathway transduces a growth signal through the polarization of transmembrane complexes that responds to both morphogen level and gradient. Dissection of these complex phenotypes requires a quantitative model that provides a systematic characterization of the pathway. In the absence of detailed knowledge of molecular interactions, we take a phenomenological approach that considers a broad class of simple models, which are sufficiently constrained by observations to enable insight into possible mechanisms. We predict two modes of local/cooperative interactions among Fat-Dachsous complexes, which are necessary for the collective polarization of tissues and enhanced sensitivity to weak gradients. Collective polarization convolves level and gradient of input signals, reproducing known phenotypes while generating falsifiable predictions.

This important role of the primary cilium in mammalian cells is in contrast with its absence from Drosophila melanogaster PCP establishment. Here, we show that deletion of GTP-binding protein alpha-i subunit 3 (Gαi3) and mammalian Partner of inscuteable (mPins) disrupts the migration of the kinocilium at the surface of cochlear hair cells and affects hair bundle orientation and shape. Inhibition of G-protein function in vitro leads to kinocilium migration defects, PCP phenotype and abnormal hair bundle morphology. We show that Gαi3/mPins are expressed in an apical and distal asymmetrical domain, which is opposite and complementary to an aPKC/Par-3/Par-6b expression domain, and non-overlapping with the core PCP protein Vangl2.

Contrary to these models, we show by quantitative biochemical means that all fundamental aspects of nucleosome remodeling are contained within the compact ATPase module of Drosophila ISWI. This domain can independently associate with DNA and nucleosomes, which in turn activate ATP turnover by inducing a conformational change in the enzyme, and it can autonomously reposition nucleosomes. The role of the HSS domain is to increase the affinity and specificity for nucleosomes. Nucleosome-remodeling enzymes may thus have evolved directly from ancestral helicase-type motors, and peripheral domains have furnished regulatory capabilities that bias the remodeling reaction toward different structural outcomes.",2013,"Johanna Ludwigsen, Henrike Klinker, Peter B Becker, Felix Mueller-Planitz"
Identification of a critical region in the Drosophila ryanodine receptor that confers sensitivity to diamide insecticides,23806522,10.1016/j.ibmb.2013.06.006,"Anthranilic diamides, which include the new commercial insecticide, chlorantraniliprole, are an exciting new class of chemistry that target insect ryanodine receptors.

As with insects, nematodes express ryanodine receptors and are sensitive to the plant alkaloid, ryanodine. However the plant parasitic nematode, Meloidogyne incognita, is insensitive to anthranilic diamides. Expression of a full-length Drosophila melanogaster ryanodine receptor in an insect cell line confers sensitivity to the receptor agents, caffeine and ryanodine along with nanomolar sensitivity to anthranilic diamides. Replacement of a 46 amino acid segment in a highly divergent region of the Drosophila C-terminus with that from Meloidogyne results in a functional RyR which lack sensitivity to diamide insecticides.

Modeling and analysis of repeat RNA toxicity in Drosophila,23719916,10.1007/978-1-62703-438-8_13,"Expansion of repeat sequences beyond a pathogenic threshold is the cause of a series of dominantly inherited neurodegenerative diseases that includes Huntington's disease, several spinocerebellar ataxias, and myotonic dystrophy types 1 and 2.

However, in a number of diseases that present with similar clinical symptoms, the expansions occur in untranslated regions of the gene that cannot encode toxic peptide products. As expanded repeat-containing RNA is common to both translated and untranslated repeat expansion diseases, this repeat RNA is hypothesized as a potential common toxic agent.We have established Drosophila models for expanded repeat diseases in order to investigate the role of multiple candidate toxic agents and the potential molecular pathways that lead to pathogenesis. In this chapter we describe methods to identify candidate pathogenic pathways and their constituent steps. This includes establishing novel phenotypes using Drosophila and developing methods for using this system to screen for possible modifiers of pathology.

Previously, we showed that an aqueous extract of Selaginella delicatula (SDAE) offered robust neuroprotection against rotenone (ROT) in a Drosophila model. In furtherance in the present study, we validated the neuroprotective efficacy of SDAE in a chronic ROT exposure model in mice. Initially, we assessed the propensity of SDAE to modulate the levels of endogenous markers in striatal region of mice. Subsequently, the neuroprotective efficacy of SDAE (100 mg/kg bw, 21 d) to mitigate ROT-induced striatal motor deficits, oxidative stress, and neurotoxicity was examined employing a co-exposure paradigm. We found significant attenuation of ROT-induced motor deficits (stride length and landing foot spread distance) among mice given SDAE supplements. Biochemical analysis revealed that ROT-induced elevation in the levels of oxidative markers in cytosol/mitochondria of striatum were normalized with SDAE supplements. In addition, SDAE also restored the ROT-induced elevation in the levels of oxidized and nitrated proteins. Further, SDAE also restored the activities of acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase indicating its effect on cholinergic function. While ROT exposure caused significant perturbations in the activity levels of mitochondrial electron transport chain enzymes (complex I/II), membrane potential and activity of ATPases, these functions were restored to normalcy among mice receiving SDAE suggesting its effects on mitochondrial function. Since these data corroborate our previous findings in Drosophila system, we propose that the neuroprotective property of SDAE may be largely attributed to the antioxidant properties and its ability to attenuate mitochondrial dysfunction. However, studies employing dopaminergic cell models would enable us to identify specific molecular mechanism, by which SDAE exerts neuroprotective action.",2013,"Girish Chandran, Muralidhara"

The data were evaluated using Student's t-test or a one-way ANOVA with a supplementary Fisher's LSD (Least Significant Difference) test. Statistical significance was set at p<0.05. The ΔERG, climbing ability, and survival were lower in AD-transgenic flies. Exposure to 2.1% sevoflurane 4 and 16 times and to 3% sevoflurane 16 times rescued the ΔERG in AD-transgenic flies. Sevoflurane exposure did not attenuate the climbing ability or survival of control and AD-transgenic flies. The inhalational anesthetic sevoflurane might not have exerted neurotoxic effects on control and AD-transgenic flies; in fact, sevoflurane might confer selective neuroprotection on the retinal function of AD-transgenic flies. These results suggest the need for future studies to determine the potential effects of anesthetics on AD-associated neuroprotection or neurotoxicity.",2013,"Yu-Cheng Kuo, Chia-Wen Chen, Chi-Yuan Li, Yih-Shyuan Wu, Wei-Yong Lin, Kuen-Bao Chen, Hsin-Ping Liu"
FKBP14 is an essential gene that regulates Presenilin protein levels and Notch signaling in Drosophila,23318643,10.1242/dev.081356,"Presenilins were identified as causative factors in familial Alzheimer's disease and also play an essential role in Notch signaling during development. We previously identified FKBP14, a member of the family of FK506-binding proteins (FKBPs), as a modifier of Presenilin in Drosophila. FKBPs are highly conserved peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases that play integral roles in protein folding, assembly and trafficking. Although FKBPs have been implicated in a broad range of biological processes, they are non-essential in yeast and their role in the development of multicellular organisms remains unclear. We show that FKBP14 is an essential gene in Drosophila and that loss of FKBP14 gives rise to specific defects in eye, bristle and wing development. FKBP14 mutants genetically interact with components of the Notch pathway, indicating that these phenotypes are associated, at least in part, with dysregulation of Notch signaling. We show that whereas Notch trafficking to the membrane is unaffected in FKBP14 mutants, levels of Notch target genes are reduced, suggesting that FKBP14 acts downstream of Notch activation at the membrane. Consistent with this model, we find that Presenilin protein levels and γ-secretase activity are reduced in FKBP14 null mutants. Altogether, our data demonstrate that FKBP14 plays an essential role in development, one aspect of which includes regulating members of the Notch signaling pathway.",2013,"Diana L van de Hoef, Julia M Bonner, Gabrielle L Boulianne"
A single dopamine pathway underlies progressive locomotor deficits in a Drosophila model of Parkinson disease,24239353,10.1016/j.celrep.2013.10.032,"Expression of the human Parkinson-disease-associated protein α-synuclein in all Drosophila neurons induces progressive locomotor deficits. Here, we identify a group of 15 dopaminergic neurons per hemisphere in the anterior medial region of the brain whose disruption correlates with climbing impairments in this model. These neurons selectively innervate the horizontal β and β' lobes of the mushroom bodies, and their connections to the Kenyon cells are markedly reduced when they express α-synuclein. Using selective mushroom body drivers, we show that blocking or overstimulating neuronal activity in the β' lobe, but not the β or γ lobes, significantly inhibits negative geotaxis behavior. This suggests that modulation of the mushroom body β' lobes by this dopaminergic pathway is specifically required for an efficient control of startle-induced locomotion in flies.",2013,"Mélanie Jacquet, Thomas Riemensperger, Hélène Coulom, Marlène Cassar, Serge Birman, Mỹ-Vân Nguyễn, Abdul-Raouf Issa, Ulrike Pech, André Fiala"
Human mitochondrial disease-like symptoms caused by a reduced tRNA aminoacylation activity in flies,23677612,10.1093/nar/gkt402,"The translation of genes encoded in the mitochondrial genome requires specific machinery that functions in the organelle. Among the many mutations linked to human disease that affect mitochondrial translation, several are localized to nuclear genes coding for mitochondrial aminoacyl-transfer RNA synthetases. The molecular significance of these mutations is poorly understood, but it is expected to be similar to that of the mutations affecting mitochondrial transfer RNAs. To better understand the molecular features of diseases caused by these mutations, and to improve their diagnosis and therapeutics, we have constructed a Drosophila melanogaster model disrupting the mitochondrial seryl-tRNA synthetase by RNA interference. At the molecular level, the knockdown generates a reduction in transfer RNA serylation, which correlates with the severity of the phenotype observed. The silencing compromises viability, longevity, motility and tissue development. At the cellular level, the knockdown alters mitochondrial morphology, biogenesis and function, and induces lactic acidosis and reactive oxygen species accumulation. We report that administration of antioxidant compounds has a palliative effect of some of these phenotypes. In conclusion, the fly model generated in this work reproduces typical characteristics of pathologies caused by mutations in the mitochondrial aminoacylation system, and can be useful to assess therapeutic approaches.",2013,"Daria Picchioni, David Piñeyro, Lluís Ribas de Pouplana, Tanit Guitart"
The proto-oncogene int-1 encodes a secreted protein associated with the extracellular matrix,2158444,,"The proto-oncogene int-1 plays an important role in mammary tumorigenesis when activated by proviral insertions of the mouse mammary tumor virus. In normal mouse tissues the gene is expressed in the embryonic neural tube, suggesting a developmental function, while in Drosophila the homolog of int-1 is the segment polarity gene wingless. In order to study the protein products of int-1 we have derived fibroblast cell lines infected with multiple copies of a retroviral vector expressing int-1 cDNA. By Western blot analysis and immunoprecipitation we have identified a 44 kd form of int-1 protein which is secreted from these cells. The 44 kd species is distinct from the major intracellular forms of int-1 protein as judged by its slower mobility in SDS-polyacrylamide gels and by its longer half-life in pulse-chase experiments. Under normal growth conditions, little or none of the 44 kd protein is detectable in the cell culture medium but instead the majority is found associated with the extracellular matrix (ECM). The protein appears to bind heparin in vitro, suggesting that it might bind glycosaminoglycans in the ECM. These data support the view that int-1 protein may play a role in cell-cell communication over short distances.",1990,"R S Bradley, A M Brown"
Bidirectional incompatibility between conspecific populations of Drosophila simulans,2234083,10.1038/348178a0,"Cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) describes the phenomenon whereby eggs fertilized by sperm from insects infected with a rickettsial endosymbiont fail to hatch. Unidirectional CI between conspecific populations of insects is a well documented phenomenon. Bidirectional CI has, however, only been described in mosquito populations, and recently between closely related species of parasitic wasps, where it is of interest as both an unusual form of reproductive isolation and as a potential means of insect population suppression. Here we report on the first known example of bidirectional CI between conspecific populations of Drosophila simulans. Further, we show that defects as early as the first cleavage division are associated with CI. This observation suggests that the cellular basis of CI involves disruption of processes before or during zygote formation and that CI arises from defects in the structure and/or function of the sperm during fertilization.",1990,"T L Karr, S L O'Neill"

Mechanisms of positional signalling in the developing eye of Drosophila studied by ectopic expression of sevenless and rough,1982113,10.1242/jcs.1990.supplement_13.15,"In the developing eye of Drosophila cell fate is controlled by a cascade of inductive interactions. Little is known about how the specificity of positional signalling is achieved such that directly adjacent progenitor cells reproducibly choose distinct developmental pathways. The determination of the R7 photoreceptor in each ommatidium depends on the presence of the sevenless protein which acts as a receptor for positional information on the R7 precursor. The rough gene encodes a homeodomain protein that plays an instructive role in the determination of the R3 and R4 photoreceptor cells. The use of ectopic expression of sevenless and rough has provided insight into the mechanisms of positional signalling and the normal function of rough. Ubiquitous expression of sevenless does not alter cell fate suggesting that the inducing signal is both spatially and temporally controlled. Conversely, ectopic expression of rough in the R7 precursor causes a transformation of R7 cells into R1-6 type cells. This indicates that rough acts, similar to other homeobox genes, as a selector gene that determines the fate of single cells.",1990,"K Basler, E Hafen"
Proteins that bind to Drosophila chorion cis-regulatory elements: a new C2H2 zinc finger protein and a C2C2 steroid receptor-like component,2120114,10.1101/gad.4.7.1128,"Gel mobility-shift assays have been used to identify proteins that bind specifically to the promoter region of the Drosophila s15 chorion gene. These proteins are present in nuclear extracts of ovarian follicles, the tissue where s15 is expressed during development, and bind to specific elements of the promoter that have been shown by transformation analysis to be important for in vivo expression. The DNA binding specificity has been used for molecular cloning of two components from expression cDNA libraries and for their tentative identification with specific DNA-binding proteins of the nuclear extracts. The mRNAs for both of these components, CF1 and CF2, are differentially enriched in the follicles. DNA sequence analysis suggests that both CF1 and CF2 are novel Drosophila transcription factors. CF2 is a member of the C2H2 family of zinc finger proteins, whereas CF1 is a member of the family of steroid hormone receptors. The putative DNA-binding domain of CF1 is highly similar to the corresponding domains of certain vertebrate hormone receptors and recognizes a region of DNA with similar, hyphenated palindromic sequences. The nature of CF1 raises the possibility of hormonal control of choriogenesis in Drosophila.",1990,"M J Shea, F C Kafatos, M J Conboy, D L King, B D Mariani"
Rat homologs of the Drosophila dunce gene code for cyclic AMP phosphodiesterases sensitive to rolipram and RO 20-1724,2153912,,"The dunce locus of Drosophila melanogaster codes for a low Km, cAMP phosphodiesterase. The correct function of this gene is required for normal learning and memory activity in flies, because dunce mutants fail in tests of behavioral conditioning. These observations have indicated that cAMP regulation is an important aspect of the biochemistry underlying learning and memory processes in insects. To determine whether the locus is functionally conserved in mammals, we have expressed dunce gene homologs from the rat in a yeast expression system. We find that the rat homologs encode low Km, cAMP phosphodiesterases similar to that coded for by the Drosophila dunce+ gene and, more importantly, that the mammalian enzymes are inhibited by rolipram and RO 20-1724, drugs with antidepressant properties. Surprisingly, the dunce-encoded phosphodiesterase was not inhibited by rolipram or RO 20-1724. These findings suggest that the phosphodiesterases, through their regulation of cAMP levels, influence learning and memory in insects and mood in mammals.",1990,"J Henkel-Tigges, R L Davis"

Proteolytic conversion of xanthine dehydrogenase from the NAD-dependent type to the O2-dependent type. Amino acid sequence of rat liver xanthine dehydrogenase and identification of the cleavage sites of the enzyme protein during irreversible conversion by trypsin,2387845,,"The primary structure of rat liver xanthine dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.204) was determined by sequence analysis of cDNA and purified enzyme.

Changes in boron concentration during development and ageing of Drosophila and effect of dietary boron on life span,2325439,10.1016/0047-6374(90)90029-f,Total boron concentrations in Drosophila changed during development and ageing. The highest concentration of boron was found during the egg stage followed by a decline during the larval stages. Newly emerged flies contained 35.5 ppm boron. During the adult stage the boron concentration increased by 52% by 9 weeks of age. Adding excess dietary boron during the adult stage decreased the median life span by 69% at 0.01 M sodium borate and by 21% at 0.001 M sodium borate. Lower concentrations gave small but significant increases in life span. Supplementing a very low boron diet with 0.00025 M sodium borate improved life span by 9.5%. The boron contents of young and old mouse tissues were similar to those of Drosophila and human samples. We conclude that moderate levels of dietary boron may have a general protective effect in biological systems.

Synthesis of two Drosophila male accessory gland proteins and their fate after transfer to the female during mating,2257979,10.1016/0012-1606(90)90368-s,"The male accessory gland of Drosophila is an adult secretory tissue which contributes many products to the male ejaculatory fluid. The secretions of the accessory gland affect the behavior and physiology of the female fly after mating, reducing her receptivity to courtship and stimulating egg production and oviposition. We have examined the developmental and mating-stimulated expression of two accessory gland proteins in the male and their transfer to and fates in the mated female. One of these proteins, msP 355a, has features of a prohormone and contains a region with amino acid sequence similarity to the egg-laying hormone of Aplysia; the other, msP 355b, is a small acidic protein. Both proteins are first detected in the accessory gland only after eclosion, although their transcripts are already present in late pupae. Both proteins are initially detected in the two morphologically distinct secretory cell types of the accessory gland, the main cells, and the secondary cells. In the glands of aged virgin males, they are only detected in the large vesicles of the secondary cells and in the lumen of the gland. Copulation results in an increase in the mRNAs for both proteins, as well as renewed translation of the proteins at least in the main cells. Both proteins are transferred to the female genital tract during copulation, and rapidly enter the female hemolymph. msP 355a is subject to rapid and specific cleavage within the female genital tract, but not in the hemolymph; msP 355b is not cleaved in either the female genital tract or the hemolymph.",1990,"S A Monsma, H A Harada, M F Wolfner"

"Establishment of the Deformed expression stripe requires the combinatorial action of coordinate, gap and pair-rule proteins",2323337,,"In Drosophila embryos, anterior-posterior positional identities are set and maintained by the expression boundaries of homeotic selector genes. The establishment of the initial expression boundaries of the homeotic genes are in turn dependent on earlier acting patterning genes of Drosophila. To define the combinations of early genes that are required to establish a unique blastoderm stripe of expression of the homeotic gene Deformed, we have analysed single and double patterning mutants and heat shock promoter fusion constructs that ectopically express early acting regulators. We find that the activation of Deformed is dependent on combinatorial input from at least three levels of the early hierarchy. The simplest activation code sufficient to establish Deformed expression, given the absence of negative regulators such as fushi-tarazu, consists of a moderate level of expression from the coordinate gene bicoid, in combination with expression from both the gap gene hunchback, and the pair-rule gene even-skipped. In addition, the activation code for Deformed is redundant; other pair-rule genes in addition to even-skipped can apparently act in combination with bicoid and hunchback to activate Deformed.",1990,"W McGinnis, T Jack"
Purification and characterization of DNA ligase II from Drosophila melanogaster,2120058,10.1111/j.1432-1033.1990.tb19284.x,"Drosophila melanogaster contains DNA ligases I and II. The activity of DNA ligase I is especially high during early embryonic periods, but decreases rapidly afterwards. Although the activity of DNA ligase II is low, it persists throughout all developmental stages. The specific activity of DNA ligase II is high in embryos, but the total activity per body mass was highest in pupae. To characterize the properties of DNA ligase II further and to clarify its differences from DNA ligase I, DNA ligase II was prepared from pupae of D. melanogaster. The enzyme was purified about 3200-fold by ammonium sulfate fractionation (40-70% saturation), phosphocellulose (P11) and Ultrogel column chromatography. Some of the properties have been reported previously. The isoelectric point of DNA ligase II was 6.4 while those of DNA ligase I were 4.9 and 5.8. The optimum pH of DNA ligase II was 7.8-8.1 but 8.0-8.5 for DNA ligase I. The molecular masses of DNA ligase II adducts with AMP were determined as 90 and 70 kDa. These adducts were degraded to 42 and 14.4 kDa by trypsin digestion. For preparation of monoclonal antibodies, a mouse was immunized with the purified enzyme.

Promoter melting and TFIID complexes on Drosophila genes in vivo,1427079,10.1101/gad.6.11.2190,"In vivo UV cross-linking and nuclear transcriptional run-on experiments have shown that a number of Drosophila genes possess an elongationally paused RNA polymerase on their 5' ends. Here, we examine in vivo promoters that do and do not possess paused polymerases using the single-stranded DNA-probing reagent KMnO4. Melted DNA helices are found associated with the pause site of the uninduced hsp70 and hsp26 heat shock genes and the constitutively expressed beta-1 tubulin gene. The histone H1 and H2B genes, which lack a paused polymerase, have no comparable region of melted DNA. Melting at the pause site persists upon heat shock induction of the hsp70 and hsp26 genes, indicating that pausing continues after gene activation. Interestingly, activation triggers additional melting, both at the start site (in the region where open complexes would be expected to form) and downstream of the uninduced pause site. In the course of our studies, we discovered that some T residues of the TATA box were protected from KMnO4 modification in both induced and uninduced cells. This protection appears to be a consequence of TFIID binding, as a similar protection pattern could be produced in vitro with purified protein.",1992,"J T Lis, M Pérez-Riba, C Giardina"

The calcium-sensitive ATPase of lobster myofibril was restored when purified lobster Tm and lobster Tn were added to actin. Quantitative SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that the lobster muscle contains actin, Tm, Tn with a molar ratio 7:1:1 and that lobster Tn consists of three subunits, one of each I, C and T. Each subunit was identified according to its effect on the acto-S1 ATPase rate. The isomer composition in each fraction of purified Tn subunit and in Tm are different from the rabbit skeletal muscle proteins; Tm consists of a single species of polypeptide of M(r) 38,000; the TnT fraction appears to be homogeneous with M(r) 43,000; the TnI fraction contains five isomers, all showing similar isoelectric pH, differing in M(r) in the range from 28,000 to 31,000; two TnC fractions contain three isomers in total with a range of M(r) from 18,500 to 19,000. Further study of the lobster Tm elucidated that digestion by carboxypeptidase A gave rise to a homogeneous preparation of truncated and non-polymerizable Tm which is devoid of 11 residues at the C-terminus of the molecule. The C-terminal amino acid sequence of 11 residues is homologous to the thoracic isomer generated from Drosophila melanogaster Tm-I gene.

Single amino acid exchanges in separate domains of the Drosophila serendipity delta zinc finger protein cause embryonic and sex biased lethality,1516821,,"The Drosophila serendipity (sry) delta (delta) zinc finger protein is a sequence-specific DNA binding protein, maternally inherited by the embryo and present in nuclei of transcriptionally active cells throughout fly development. We report here the isolation and characterization of four ethyl methanesulfate-induced zygotic lethal mutations of different strengths in the sry delta gene. For the stronger allele, all of the lethality occurs during late embryogenesis or the first larval instar. In the cases of the three weaker alleles, most of the lethality occurs during pupation; moreover, those adult escapers that emerge are sterile males lacking partially or completely in spermatozoa bundles. Genetic analysis of sry delta thus indicates that it is an essential gene, whose continued expression throughout the life cycle, notably during embryogenesis and pupal stage, is required for viability. Phenotypic analysis of sry delta hemizygote escaper males further suggests that sry delta may be involved in regulation of two different sets of genes: genes required for viability and genes involved in gonadal development. All four sry delta alleles are fully rescued by a wild-type copy of sry delta, but not by an additional copy of the sry beta gene, reinforcing the view that, although structurally related, these two genes exert distinct functions. Molecular characterization of the four sry delta mutations revealed that these mutations correspond to single amino acid replacements in the sry delta protein. Three of these replacements map to the same (third out of seven) zinc finger in the carboxy-terminal DNA binding domain; interestingly, none affects the zinc finger consensus residues. The fourth mutation is located in the NH2-proximal part of the protein, in a domain proposed to be involved in specific protein-protein interactions.",1992,"P Ferrer, J A Lengyel, J R Merriam, M Crozatier, K Kongsuwan, A Vincent"

The strongest of these patterns mimics Ubx expression within the Ubx domain. This pattern is strictly dependent on Ubx function.

Differential translatability of antifreeze protein mRNAs in a transgenic host,1730058,10.1016/0167-4781(92)90486-j,"The expression of fusion gene constructs containing Drosophila regulatory sequences and the structural portions of fish antifreeze protein genes have been examined by transfer into Drosophila melanogaster using P elements. A fusion gene, containing the enhancer, promoter, and cap site of the yolk polypeptide 1 gene, joined in the 5'-untranslated region to the structural portion of the winter flounder type I antifreeze gene, was transcribed in mature female transformants to give an mRNA of the predicted size, but no antifreeze protein was detected by Western blotting. When the same antifreeze protein gene was fused to a Drosophila hsp 70 gene regulatory region and placed downstream of the yolk polypeptide gene enhancer, appropriate expression of mRNA was directed by both gene regulatory elements. However, a translation product from this mRNA was only observed under heat shock conditions and was present at low levels. It is suggested that type I antifreeze mRNA, with its high content of alanine codons and their grouping into clusters of up to seven in a row, is poorly translated when in competition with other host mRNAs. In agreement with this hypothesis, a fusion gene construct between the yolk protein gene regulatory region and two type III antifreeze protein genes produced sub-mmolar concentrations of antifreeze protein in mature females from each of several transgenic lines analysed. The type III antifreeze protein does not have an imbalanced amino acid composition or sequence irregularities, and may be an appropriate choice for conferring freeze protection to frost-susceptible hosts by gene transfer.",1992,"P L Davies, D E Rancourt, V K Walker"
Signalling by the sevenless protein tyrosine kinase is mimicked by Ras1 activation,1311054,10.1038/355559a0,"Cell-fate specification of R7 photoreceptors in the developing Drosophila eye depends on an inductive signal from neighbouring R8 cells. Mutations in three genes, sevenless (sev), bride-of-sevenless (boss) and seven-in-absentia (sina) cause the R7 precursor to become a non-neural cone cell. The sev gene encodes a receptor protein tyrosine kinase (Sev) localized on the R7 surface, activated by a boss-encoded ligand presented by R8. The sina gene encodes a nuclear factor required in R7. Reduction in the dosage of the Ras1 gene impairs Sev-mediated signalling, suggesting that activation of Ras1 may be an important consequence of Sev activation. We report here that Ras1 activation may account for all of the signalling action of Sev; an activated Ras1Va112 protein rescues the normal R7 precursor from transformation into a cone cell in sev and boss null mutants and induces the formation of supernumerary R7 cells. Similar activation of the Drosophila Ras2 protein does not produce these effects, demonstrating Ras protein specificity.",1992,"G M Rubin, M E Fortini, M A Simon"

It is possible that SSP may be a glutathione S-transferase(s) in E. coli or is evolutionarily related to glutathione S-transferases.

In the mutants, neuronal precursor cells do not differentiate, suggesting that Hairless might be involved in specifying or realizing neuronal fate in the fly, similar to the 'pro-neural' genes of the achaete-scute complex. As highlighted by the manifold phenotypic interactions of Hairless with most of the neurogenic loci, the gene might play an important role in nervous system development. Therefore, we initiated a molecular analysis of the Hairless locus in order to elucidate the function of its gene product and gain insight into the biochemical nature of the observed genetic interactions in which it participates. Here, we report the molecular cloning of the Hairless locus, confirmed by breakpoint and transformation analysis. Unexpectedly, Hairless activity peaks during embryogenesis, where transcripts accumulate primarily in endo- and mesodermal cell layers, and is lowest during larval stages, the lethal phase of Hairless mutants. The putative Hairless protein deduced from DNA sequencing is extremely basic and highly enriched in serine residues. Hairless appears to encode a novel protein without compelling homology to other known proteins which function in specifying peripheral nervous system development in Drosophila.",1992,"K Kuhn, G Stumm, D Maier, A Preiss"
Identification and characterization of Drosophila female germ line transcriptional control elements,1592002,,"The highly organized structure of the Drosophila ovary makes it an ideal system for studying mechanisms of differential gene expression. Here we report the identification of a 171 bp sequence from the 5' end of the hsp26 gene that functions as a female germ-line-specific transcriptional regulator when linked in two copies to a basal promoter. The regulator is active only in nondividing cells of the germ line, i.e., only in nurse cells and oocytes. It is not active in any examined tissue or cell type outside of the female germ line. Copper nuclease footprinting studies show that the germ line regulator contains two binding sites for each of two different ovarian nuclear factors. Point mutations in the DNA target sites of either nuclear factor abolish in vitro binding and in vivo transcriptional activity, indicating that each factor is a positive activator of nurse cell/oocyte transcription. The two factors may represent different classes of activator proteins, since an increase in the copy number of one factor's DNA target site cannot compensate for a decrease in the copy number of the other factor's target site.",1992,"R S Cohen, H K Cheung, L H Frank"
Laminin A chain: expression during Drosophila development and genomic sequence,1425586,,"A Drosophila laminin A chain gene was characterized as a 14 kb genomic nucleotide sequence which encodes an open reading frame of 3712 amino acids in 15 exons. Overall, this A chain is similar to its vertebrate counterparts, especially in its N- and C-terminal globular domains, but the sequence that forms the laminin A short arm is quite different and larger. Laminin messages appear in newly formed mesoderm and are later prominently expressed in hemocytes, which also synthesize basement membrane collagen IV. The composition of Drosophila basement membranes changes with development. A novel method of tandemly fused RNA probes showed that developmental increases of laminin mRNAs were primarily associated with periods of morphogenesis, and preceded those of collagen IV, a protein strongly expressed during growth. The ratio of A:B1:B2 mRNAs varied little during embryogenesis, with less mRNA for A than B chains. Staining of embryos with antibodies confirmed and extended the information provided by in situ hybridization. Homologs of the G-subdomains of this A chain, which occur in interacting regions of agrin, perlecan, laminin and sex steroid binding protein, may be involved in protein associations.",1992,"J H Fessler, L I Fessler, A J MacKrell, K Garrison, M Kusche-Gullberg"

Results are consistent with the idea that the number of loci responsible for insecticide resistance in D. melanogaster is not large.,1992,D Dapkus
In vitro induction of cecropin genes--an immune response in a Drosophila blood cell line,1445351,10.1016/0006-291x(92)91354-s,"The Drosophila melanogaster cell line mbn-2 was explored as a model system to study insect immune responses in vitro. This cell line is of blood cell origin, derived from larval hemocytes of the mutant lethal (2) malignant blood neoplasm (1(2)mbn). The mbn-2 cells respond to microbial substances by the activation of cecropin genes, coding for bactericidal peptides. The response is stronger than that previously described for SL2 cells, and four other tested Drosophila cell lines were totally unresponsive. Bacterial lipopolysaccharide, algal laminarin (a beta-1,3-glucan), and bacterial flagellin were strong inducers, bacterial peptidoglycan fragments gave a weaker response, whereas a formyl-methionine-containing peptide had no effect.

Further observation of paternal transmission of Drosophila mitochondrial DNA by PCR selective amplification method,1628820,10.1017/s0016672300030287,"By designing 3' ends of primers in PCR (polymerase chain reaction), a specific DNA fragment was selectively amplified in the presence of a 10(3)-fold excess of highly homologous (sequence difference ca. 2%) opponent DNA. This technique was applied in detecting paternal leakage of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in intraspecific crosses of Drosophila simulans and interspecific crosses of Drosophila simulans and Drosophila mauritiana. The mtDNA types of their progeny were analysed by selective amplification of the paternal mtDNA fragment possessing a polymorphic restriction site and detecting its cleaved fragments. Paternal mtDNA was detected in the progeny of 14 out of 16 crosses.

Molecular genetics and the ontogeny of pigment patterns in mammals,1363334,10.1111/j.1600-0749.1992.tb00557.x,"The conclusion that animal development is guided by a hierarchical system of gene expression and interaction has gained considerable support from recent molecular genetic studies on fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) and mice (Mus musculus). They demonstrate that the patterns of organization revealed by terminal differentiation of cells is anticipated by a myriad of transient prepatterns that channel the developing embryo toward its genetically-programmed target. The numerous white spotting mutants in mice exhibit some of the most dramatic and variable patterns of cutaneous melanin pigmentation. Until recently, the mechanisms of action of white spotting genes and their relationship to the developmental genetic hierarchy remained unknown. It now appears that certain white spotting genes may encode growth factors essential for melanoblast development. Others may be related to homeobox genes that play a number of developmental roles, the primary one being the determination of regional organization along the anterior-posterior axis of the early embryo. The patterns of homeobox gene expression are consistent with several of the developmental models for white spotting in mice and other mammals. It is evident that white spotting genes are not solely concerned with the terminal differentiation of melanoblasts into melanocytes. They are heterogeneous with regard to action and level of expression within the developmental hierarchy.",1992,"T J Holstein, W C Quevedo Jr"
Suboptimal 5' and 3' splice sites regulate alternative splicing of Drosophila melanogaster myosin heavy chain transcripts in vitro,1498040,10.1016/0925-4773(92)90075-u,"Using a Drosophila cell-free system, we have analyzed the regulation of alternative splicing of Drosophila muscle myosin heavy chain (MHC) transcripts. Splicing of MHC 3' end transcripts results in exclusion of adult-specific alternative exon 18, as is observed in embryonic and larval muscle in vivo. Mutations that strengthen either the 5' or the 3' splice sites of exon 18 do not promote inclusion of this exon. However, strengthening both splice junctions results in efficient removal of both introns and completely inhibits skip splicing. Our data suggest that the affinity of exons 17 and 19, as well as failure of constitutive splicing factors to recognize exon 18 splice sites, causes the exclusion of exon 18 in wild-type transcripts processed in vitro.",1992,"S I Bernstein, D Hodges"
"Dipeptidase-C in Drosophila melanogaster: genetic, ontogenetic, and tissue-specific variation",1296574,10.1007/BF02399810,"Dip-A, Dip-B, and Dip-C constitute structural genes for three peptidic enzymes in Drosophila melanogaster distinct from the leucine aminopeptidases. Their ontogenetic and tissue distributions of activities suggest the involvement of these enzymes in a general metabolic role, such as the regulation of amino acid and oligopeptide pools to make amino acids available for protein synthesis. Screening of chromosome substitution isogenic lines for DIP-C activity indicated that, like DIP-A and DIP-B, unlinked activity modifiers exist for Dip-C. The developmental profiles of dipeptidase activities are very similar, except in the pupal stage, during which DIP-C activity is markedly low compared to the other two enzymes. Intercorrelations of dipeptidase activities vary ontogenetically, which is consistent with the need for coordinate expression of these enzymes during certain developmental stages. Tissue-specific expression of dipeptidases in larvae and adults are also similar, although the relative levels of DIP-A activity differ from those of DIP-B and DIP-C in certain organs and body parts. Some of the differences among chromosome substitution lines for dipeptidase activities appear to be systemic, while others are developmental stage-specific and tissue-specific. Second- and third-chromosome variants for DIP-C activity differed in their tissue distribution. This is consistent with the presence of temporal and spatial variants in natural populations for other Drosophila enzymes.",1992,"J E Freeman 4th, C L Hourani, M C Zambarano, K D Mathes, K Hiraizumi"
Analysis of phototoxin taste closely correlates nucleophilicity to type 1 phototoxicity,31138707,10.1073/pnas.1905998116,"Pigments often inflict tissue-damaging and proaging toxicity on light illumination by generating free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, the molecular mechanism by which organisms sense phototoxic pigments is unknown. Here, we discover that Transient Receptor Potential Ankyrin 1-A isoform [TRPA1(A)], previously shown to serve as a receptor for free radicals and ROS induced by photochemical reactions, enables Drosophila melanogaster to aphotically sense phototoxic pigments for feeding deterrence. Thus, TRPA1(A) detects both cause (phototoxins) and effect (free radicals and ROS) of photochemical reactions. A group of pigment molecules not only activates TRPA1(A) in darkness but also generates free radicals on light illumination. Such aphotic detection of phototoxins harboring the type 1 (radical-generating) photochemical potential requires the nucleophile-sensing ability of TRPA1. In addition, agTRPA1(A) from malaria-transmitting mosquitoes Anopheles gambiae heterologously produces larger current responses to phototoxins than Drosophila TRPA1(A), similar to their disparate nucleophile responsiveness. Along with TRPA1(A)-stimulating capabilities, type 1 phototoxins exhibit relatively strong photo-absorbance and low energy gaps between the highest occupied molecular orbital and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital. However, TRPA1(A) activation is more highly concordant to type 1 phototoxicity than are those photochemical parameters. Collectively, nucleophile sensitivity of TRPA1(A) allows flies to taste potential phototoxins for feeding deterrence, preventing postingestive photo-injury. Conversely, pigments need to bear high nucleophilicity (electron-donating propensity) to act as type 1 phototoxins, which is consistent with the fact that transferring photoexcited electrons from phototoxins to other molecules causes free radicals. Thus, identification of a sensory mechanism in Drosophila reveals a property fundamental to type 1 phototoxins.",2019,"Eun Jo Du, Hyung-Wook Kim, Hwajin Sung, KyeongJin Kang, HyunJi Jo, Seong-Tae Kim, Tae Jung Ahn"
An in vitro study of NF-κB factors cooperatively in regulation of Drosophila melanogaster antimicrobial peptide genes,30735676,10.1016/j.dci.2019.01.017,"An important innate immune response in Drosophila melanogaster is the production of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Expression of AMP genes is mediated by the Toll and immune deficiency (IMD) pathways via NF-κB transcription factors Dorsal, DIF and Relish. Dorsal and DIF act downstream of the Toll pathway, whereas Relish acts in the IMD pathway. Dorsal and DIF are held inactive in the cytoplasm by the IκB protein Cactus, while Relish contains an IκB-like inhibitory domain at the C-terminus. NF-κB factors normally form homodimers and heterodimers to regulate gene expression, but formation of heterodimers between Relish and DIF or Dorsal and the specificity and activity of the three NF-κB homodimers and heterodimers are not well understood. In this study, we compared the activity of Rel homology domains (RHDs) of Dorsal, DIF and Relish in activation of Drosophila AMP gene promoters, demonstrated that Relish-RHD (Rel-RHD) interacted with both Dorsal-RHD and DIF-RHD, Relish-N interacted with DIF and Dorsal, and overexpression of individual RHD and co-expression of any two RHDs activated the activity of AMP gene promoters to various levels, suggesting formation of homodimers and heterodimers among Dorsal, DIF and Relish. Rel-RHD homodimers were stronger activators than heterodimers of Rel-RHD with either DIF-RHD or Dorsal-RHD, while DIF-RHD-Dorsal-RHD heterodimers were stronger activators than either DIF-RHD or Dorsal-RHD homodimers in activation of AMP gene promoters.

Maintenance of homeostatic plasticity at the Drosophila neuromuscular synapse requires continuous IP 3-directed signaling,31180325,10.7554/eLife.39643,"Synapses and circuits rely on neuroplasticity to adjust output and meet physiological needs. Forms of homeostatic synaptic plasticity impart stability at synapses by countering destabilizing perturbations. The Drosophila melanogaster larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is a model synapse with robust expression of homeostatic plasticity. At the NMJ, a homeostatic system detects impaired postsynaptic sensitivity to neurotransmitter and activates a retrograde signal that restores synaptic function by adjusting neurotransmitter release. This process has been separated into temporally distinct phases, induction and maintenance. One prevailing hypothesis is that a shared mechanism governs both phases. Here, we show the two phases are separable. Combining genetics, pharmacology, and electrophysiology, we find that a signaling system consisting of PLCβ, inositol triphosphate (IP3), IP3 receptors, and Ryanodine receptors is required only for the maintenance of homeostatic plasticity. We also find that the NMJ is capable of inducing homeostatic signaling even when its sustained maintenance process is absent.

Binucleation of male accessory gland cells in the common bed bug Cimex lectularius,31019205,10.1038/s41598-019-42844-0,"The insect male accessory gland (MAG) is an internal reproductive organ responsible for the synthesis and secretion of seminal fluid components, which play a pivotal role in the male reproductive strategy. In many species of insects, the effective ejaculation of the MAG products is essential for male reproduction. For this purpose, the fruit fly Drosophila has evolved binucleation in the MAG cells, which causes high plasticity of the glandular epithelium, leading to an increase in the volume of seminal fluid that is ejaculated. However, such a binucleation strategy has only been sporadically observed in Dipteran insects, including fruit flies. Here, we report the discovery of binucleation in the MAG of the common bed bug, Cimex lectularius, which belongs to hemimetabolous Hemiptera phylogenetically distant from holometabolous Diptera. In Cimex, the cell morphology and timing of synchrony during binucleation are quite different from those of Drosophila. Additionally, in Drosophila, the position of the two nuclei in the adult stage changes as a result of the mating history or the nutrient conditions; however, it remains stable in Cimex. These differences suggest that binucleation in the Cimex MAG plays a unique role in the male reproductive system that is distinct from that of Drosophila.",2019,"Aoi Miki, Takashi Adachi-Yamada, Jun Yamauchi, Chow-Yang Lee, Xin-Yeng Leong, Koji Takeda, Stephen L Doggett, Daeyun Kim"
Monitoring of switches in heterochromatin-induced silencing shows incomplete establishment and developmental instabilities,31527269,10.1073/pnas.1909724116,"Position effect variegation (PEV) in Drosophila results from new juxtapositions of euchromatic and heterochromatic chromosomal regions, and manifests as striking bimodal patterns of gene expression. The semirandom patterns of PEV, reflecting clonal relationships between cells, have been interpreted as gene-expression states that are set in development and thereafter maintained without change through subsequent cell divisions. The rate of instability of PEV is almost entirely unexplored beyond the final expression of the modified gene; thus the origin of the expressivity and patterns of PEV remain unexplained. Many properties of PEV are not predicted from currently accepted biochemical and theoretical models. In this work we investigate the time at which expressivity of silencing is set, and find that it is determined before heterochromatin exists. We employ a mathematical simulation and a corroborating experimental approach to monitor switching (i.e., gains and losses of silencing) through development. In contrast to current views, we find that gene silencing is incompletely set early in embryogenesis, but nevertheless is repeatedly lost and gained in individual cells throughout development. Our data support an alternative to locus-specific ""epigenetic"" silencing at variegating gene promoters that more fully accounts for the final patterns of PEV.",2019,"Gary R Huckell, Keith A Maggert, Farah Bughio"
Evasion of phagotrophic predation by protist hosts and innate immunity of metazoan hosts by Legionella pneumophila,30370624,10.1111/cmi.12971,"Legionella pneumophila is a ubiquitous environmental bacterium that has evolved to infect and proliferate within amoebae and other protists. It is thought that accidental inhalation of contaminated water particles by humans is what has enabled this pathogen to proliferate within alveolar macrophages and cause pneumonia. However, the highly evolved macrophages are equipped with more sophisticated innate defence mechanisms than are protists, such as the evolution of phagotrophic feeding into phagocytosis with more evolved innate defence processes. Not surprisingly, the majority of proteins involved in phagosome biogenesis (~80%) have origins in the phagotrophy stage of evolution. There are a plethora of highly evolved cellular and innate metazoan processes, not represented in protist biology, that are modulated by L. pneumophila, including TLR2 signalling, NF-κB, apoptotic and inflammatory processes, histone modification, caspases, and the NLRC-Naip5 inflammasomes. Importantly, L. pneumophila infects haemocytes of the invertebrate Galleria mellonella, kill G. mellonella larvae, and proliferate in and kill Drosophila adult flies and Caenorhabditis elegans. Although coevolution with protist hosts has provided a substantial blueprint for L. pneumophila to infect macrophages, we discuss the further evolutionary aspects of coevolution of L. pneumophila and its adaptation to modulate various highly evolved innate metazoan processes prior to becoming a human pathogen.",2019,"Ashley M Best, Yousef Abu Kwaik"
Multidimensional Proteomics Identifies Declines in Protein Homeostasis and Mitochondria as Early Signals for Normal Aging and Age-associated Disease in Drosophila,31434710,10.1074/mcp.RA119.001621,"Aging is characterized by a gradual deterioration in proteome.

Our data demonstrated that dysregulation of proteome homeostasis, or proteostasis, might be a common feature associated with age. We further used pulsed metabolic stable isotope labeling analysis to characterize protein synthesis. Interestingly, this study determined an age-modulated decline in protein synthesis with age, particularly in the pathways related to mitochondria, neurotransmission, and proteostasis. Importantly, this decline became dramatically accelerated in Pink1 mutants, a Drosophila model of human age-related Parkinson's disease. Taken together, our multidimensional proteomic study revealed tissue-specific protein dynamics with age, highlighting mitochondrial and proteostasis-related proteins.

A high-fat diet impacts memory and gene expression of the head in mated female Drosophila melanogaster,30810797,10.1007/s00360-019-01209-9,"Obesity predisposes humans to a range of life-threatening comorbidities, including type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Obesity also aggravates neural pathologies, such as Alzheimer's disease, but this class of comorbidity is less understood. When Drosophila melanogaster (flies) are exposed to high-fat diet (HFD) by supplementing a standard medium with coconut oil, they adopt an obese phenotype of decreased lifespan, increased triglyceride storage, and hindered climbing ability. The latter development has been previously regarded as a potential indicator of neurological decline in fly models of neurodegenerative disease. Our objective was to establish the obesity phenotype in Drosophila and identify a potential correlation, if any, between obesity and neurological decline through behavioral assays and gene expression microarray. We found that mated female w1118 flies exposed to HFD maintained an obese phenotype throughout adult life starting at 7 days, evidenced by increased triglyceride stores, diminished life span, and impeded climbing ability. While climbing ability worsened cumulatively between 7 and 14 days of exposure to HFD, there was no corresponding alteration in triglyceride content. Microarray analysis of the mated female w1118 fly head revealed HFD-induced changes in expression of genes with functions in memory, metabolism, olfaction, mitosis, cell signaling, and motor function. Meanwhile, an Aversive Phototaxis Suppression assay in mated female flies indicated reduced ability to recall an entrained memory 6 h after training. Overall, our results support the suitability of mated female flies for examining connections between diet-induced obesity and nervous or neurobehavioral pathology, and provide many directions for further investigation.",2019,"Silvienne Sint Jago, Bridget Konadu, Lara McHan, Osvaldo Rivera, Matthew E Talbert, Sumitkumar Patel"

The probands exhibited shared phenotypes of epilepsy, colobomas, facial dysmorphology reminiscent of CHARGE syndrome, developmental delay and intellectual disability, and cerebellar hypoplasia. The WDR37 protein is highly conserved in vertebrate and invertebrate model organisms and is currently not associated with a human disease. We generated a null allele of the single Drosophila ortholog to gain functional insights and replaced the coding region of the fly gene CG12333/wdr37 with GAL4. These flies are homozygous viable but display severe bang sensitivity, a phenotype associated with seizures in flies. Additionally, the mutant flies fall when climbing the walls of the vials, suggesting a defect in grip strength, and repeat the cycle of climbing and falling. Similar to wall clinging defect, mutant males often lose grip of the female abdomen during copulation. These phenotypes are rescued by using the GAL4 in the CG12333/wdr37 locus to drive the UAS-human reference WDR37 cDNA.

Two modes of transvection at the eyes absent gene of Drosophila demonstrate plasticity in transcriptional regulatory interactions in cis and in trans,31075100,10.1371/journal.pgen.1008152,"For many genes, proper gene expression requires coordinated and dynamic interactions between multiple regulatory elements, each of which can either promote or silence transcription. In Drosophila, the complexity of the regulatory landscape is further complicated by the tight physical pairing of homologous chromosomes, which can permit regulatory elements to interact in trans, a phenomenon known as transvection. To better understand how gene expression can be programmed through cis- and trans-regulatory interactions, we analyzed transvection effects for a collection of alleles of the eyes absent (eya) gene. We find that trans-activation of a promoter by the eya eye-specific enhancers is broadly supported in many allelic backgrounds, and that the availability of an enhancer to act in trans can be predicted based on the molecular lesion of an eya allele. Furthermore, by manipulating promoter availability in cis and in trans, we demonstrate that the eye-specific enhancers of eya show plasticity in their promoter preference between two different transcriptional start sites, which depends on promoter competition between the two potential targets. Finally, we show that certain alleles of eya demonstrate pairing-sensitive silencing resulting from trans-interactions between Polycomb Response Elements (PREs), and genetic and genomic data support a general role for PcG proteins in mediating transcriptional silencing at eya. Overall, our data highlight how eya gene regulation relies upon a complex but plastic interplay between multiple enhancers, promoters, and PREs.",2019,"Jack R Bateman, Justine E Johnson, Katherine Tian, Rachel E Henderson, Alexia Brown, Reyna Parker"
Highly structured homolog pairing reflects functional organization of the Drosophila genome,31582763,10.1038/s41467-019-12208-3,"Trans-homolog interactions have been studied extensively in Drosophila, where homologs are paired in somatic cells and transvection is prevalent. Nevertheless, the detailed structure of pairing and its functional impact have not been thoroughly investigated. Accordingly, we generated a diploid cell line from divergent parents and applied haplotype-resolved Hi-C, showing that homologs pair with varying precision genome-wide, in addition to establishing trans-homolog domains and compartments. We also elucidate the structure of pairing with unprecedented detail, observing significant variation across the genome and revealing at least two forms of pairing: tight pairing, spanning contiguous small domains, and loose pairing, consisting of single larger domains. Strikingly, active genomic regions (A-type compartments, active chromatin, expressed genes) correlated with tight pairing, suggesting that pairing has a functional implication genome-wide. Finally, using RNAi and haplotype-resolved Hi-C, we show that disruption of pairing-promoting factors results in global changes in pairing, including the disruption of some interaction peaks.",2019,"Job Dekker, C-Ting Wu, Son C Nguyen, Bryan R Lajoie, Leonid A Mirny, Jelena Erceg, Jumana AlHaj Abed, Geoffrey Fudenberg, Ruth B McCole, Anton Goloborodko, Wren Saylor"
Adaptation and Conservation throughout the Drosophila melanogaster Life-Cycle,31028390,10.1093/gbe/evz086,"Previous studies of the evolution of genes expressed at different life-cycle stages of Drosophila melanogaster have not been able to disentangle adaptive from nonadaptive substitutions when using nonsynonymous sites. Here, we overcome this limitation by combining whole-genome polymorphism data from D. melanogaster and divergence data between D. melanogaster and Drosophila yakuba. For the set of genes expressed at different life-cycle stages of D. melanogaster, as reported in modENCODE, we estimate the ratio of substitutions relative to polymorphism between nonsynonymous and synonymous sites (α) and then α is discomposed into the ratio of adaptive (ωa) and nonadaptive (ωna) substitutions to synonymous substitutions. We find that the genes expressed in mid- and late-embryonic development are the most conserved, whereas those expressed in early development and postembryonic stages are the least conserved. Importantly, we found that low conservation in early development is due to high rates of nonadaptive substitutions (high ωna), whereas in postembryonic stages it is due, instead, to high rates of adaptive substitutions (high ωa). By using estimates of different genomic features (codon bias, average intron length, exon number, recombination rate, among others), we also find that genes expressed in mid- and late-embryonic development show the most complex architecture: they are larger, have more exons, more transcripts, and longer introns. In addition, these genes are broadly expressed among all stages. We suggest that all these genomic features are related to the conservation of mid- and late-embryonic development. Globally, our study supports the hourglass pattern of conservation and adaptation over the life-cycle.",2019,"Marta Coronado-Zamora, Irepan Salvador-Martínez, Antonio Barbadilla, Isaac Salazar-Ciudad, David Castellano"

Drosophila Acquires a Long-Lasting Body-Size Memory from Visual Feedback,31104933,10.1016/j.cub.2019.04.037,"Grasping an object or crossing a trench requires the integration of information on the operating distance of our limbs with precise distance estimation. The reach of our hands and step size of our legs are learned by the visual feedback we get during our actions. This implicit knowledge of our peripersonal space is first acquired during infancy but will be continuously updated throughout our whole life [1]. In contrast, body size of holometabolous insects does not change after metamorphosis; nevertheless, they do have to learn their body reaches at least once. The body size of Drosophila imagines can vary by about 15% depending on environmental factors like food quality and temperature [2]. To investigate how flies acquire knowledge about and memorize their body size, we studied their decisions to either refrain from or initiate climbing over gaps exceeding their body size [3]. Naive (dark-reared) flies overestimate their size and have to learn it from the parallax motion of the retinal images of objects in their environment while walking. Naive flies can be trained in a striped arena and manipulated to underestimate their size, but once consolidated, this memory seems to last for a lifetime. Consolidation of this memory is stress sensitive only in the first 2 h after training but cannot be retrieved for the next 12 h. We have identified a set of intrinsic, lateral neurons of the protocerebral bridge of the central complex [4, 5] that depend on dCREB2 transcriptional activity for long-term memory consolidation and maintenance.",2019,"Burkhard Poeck, Roland Strauss, Laura Spindler, Tammo Krause"
SMAD4 and TGFβR2 expression in pancreatic ductal carcinoma,31912090,,"Pancreatic ductal carcinoma is the most common type of pancreatic cancer, and currently represents the fourth cause of death by cancer, worldwide. Among classical pancreatic markers that ascertain the histopathology, new emerging targets have been proposed for both diagnostic and prognostic purposes.

SMAD4 showed an overall increase in tumors versus pancreatic control tissue, but a decrease from G1 towards poorly differentiated tumors, while TGFβR2, vimentin and CD105 showed higher expression values in the tumor areas. Vimentin-CD105 colocalization degree decreased in tumor tissues compared to controls, illustrating a desynchronization of these two markers, both of them being negative in the tumor epithelia.

Transgenerational effects from single larval exposure to azadirachtin on life history and behavior traits of Drosophila melanogaster,31745147,10.1038/s41598-019-53474-x,"Azadirachtin is one of the successful botanical pesticides in agricultural use with a broad-spectrum insecticide activity, but its possible transgenerational effects have not been under much scrutiny. The effects of sublethal doses of azadirachtin on life-table traits and oviposition behaviour of a model organism in toxicological studies, D. melanogaster, were evaluated. The fecundity and oviposition preference of flies surviving to single azadirachtin-treated larvae of parental generation was adversely affected and resulted in the reduction of the number of eggs laid and increased aversion to this compound over two successive generations. In parental generation, early exposure to azadirachtin affects adult's development by reducing the number of organisms, delay larval and pupal development; male biased sex ratio and induced morphological alterations. Moreover, adult's survival of the two generations was significantly decreased as compared to the control. Therefore, Single preimaginal azadirachtin treatment can affect flies population dynamics via transgenerational reductions in survival and reproduction capacity as well as reinforcement of oviposition avoidance which can contribute as repellent strategies in integrated pest management programs. The transgenerational effects observed suggest a possible reduction both in application frequency and total amount of pesticide used, would help in reducing both control costs and possible ecotoxicological risks.",2019,"M Ferdenache, R Bezzar-Bendjazia, S Kilani-Morakchi, F Marion-Poll"
"Use of machine learning to identify novel, behaviorally active antagonists of the insect odorant receptor co-receptor (Orco) subunit",30858563,10.1038/s41598-019-40640-4,"Olfaction is a key component of the multimodal approach used by mosquitoes to target and feed on humans, spreading various diseases. Current repellents have drawbacks, necessitating development of more effective agents. In addition to variable odorant specificity subunits, all insect odorant receptors (ORs) contain a conserved odorant receptor co-receptor (Orco) subunit which is an attractive target for repellent development. Orco directed antagonists allosterically inhibit odorant activation of ORs and we previously showed that an airborne Orco antagonist could inhibit insect olfactory behavior. Here, we identify novel, volatile Orco antagonists. We functionally screened 83 structurally diverse compounds against Orco from Anopheles gambiae. Results were used for training machine learning models to rank probable activity of a library of 1280 odorant molecules. Functional testing of a representative subset of predicted active compounds revealed enrichment for Orco antagonists, many structurally distinct from previously known Orco antagonists. Novel Orco antagonist 2-tert-butyl-6-methylphenol (BMP) inhibited odorant responses in electroantennogram and single sensillum recordings in adult Drosophila melanogaster and inhibited OR-mediated olfactory behavior in D. melanogaster larvae.

Flies Regulate Wing Motion via Active Control of a Dual-Function Gyroscope,31607538,10.1016/j.cub.2019.08.065,"Flies execute their remarkable aerial maneuvers using a set of wing steering muscles, which are activated at specific phases of the stroke cycle [1-3]. The activation phase of these muscles-which determines their biomechanical output [4-6]-arises via feedback from mechanoreceptors at the base of the wings and structures unique to flies called halteres [7-9]. Evolved from the hindwings, the tiny halteres oscillate at the same frequency as the wings, although they serve no aerodynamic function [10] and are thought to act as gyroscopes [10-15]. Like the wings, halteres possess minute control muscles whose activity is modified by descending visual input [16], raising the possibility that flies control wing motion by adjusting the motor output of their halteres, although this hypothesis has never been directly tested. Here, using genetic techniques possible in Drosophila melanogaster, we tested the hypothesis that visual input during flight modulates haltere muscle activity and that this, in turn, alters the mechanosensory feedback that regulates the wing steering muscles. Our results suggest that rather than acting solely as a gyroscope to detect body rotation, halteres also function as an adjustable clock to set the spike timing of wing motor neurons, a specialized capability that evolved from the generic flight circuitry of their four-winged ancestors. In addition to demonstrating how the efferent control loop of a sensory structure regulates wing motion, our results provide insight into the selective scenario that gave rise to the evolution of halteres.",2019,"Michael H Dickinson, Ainul Huda, Alysha M de Souza, Bradley H Dickerson"
Spatial activation and repression of the drosophila vitelline membrane gene VM32E are switched by a complex cis-regulatory system,10878615,10.1002/1097-0177(200007)218:3<499::AID-DVDY1006>3.0.CO;2-J,"The VM32E gene is differently expressed in the distinct cell domains composing the follicular epithelium. Our previous work on the VM32E gene defined the promoter regions required for the control of gene expression in the ventral and dorsal follicle domains. In this report, we present data from a finer dissection of each upstream regulatory region, allowing to draw the functional interactions among different regulatory elements. A 73-bp proximal region (-112/-39) contains regulatory element(s) to dictate the activation of the gene in the follicular epithelium. This region interacts with two other cis-regulatory elements and is absolutely required for their output. The first element (-206/ -113), individually unable to raise reporter expression, elicits gene activity in the ventral domain when joined to the proximal fragment; a second element (-348/-254) joined to the same proximal fragment sustains the full dorsal and ventral activity. Moreover, the ectopic expression driven by some promoter fragments in border or posterior cells uncovers the existence of specific negative regulatory elements. So, the follicular domain specificity of VM32E gene expression is achieved through the combined activities of cell-type specific positive and negative elements.",2000,"F M Cernilogar, D Andrenacci, G Gargiulo, V Cavaliere"
Expression and translocation of Drosophila nuclear encoded cytochrome b(5) proteins to mitochondria,10899459,10.1016/s0965-1748(00)00064-3,DNA sequence studies of cytochrome b(5) (Cyt-b) genes from Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila virilis predict that the Drosophila Cyt-b proteins are extremely hydrophobic and have at least eight potential transmembrane spanning domains.

We report the characterization of the cytochrome b(5) proteins from Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila virilis. We have used a Drosophila cytochrome b(5) specific antibody to demonstrate that cytochrome b(5) proteins are expressed in muscle-containing tissues in the fly.

Comparison of the Hv-RyR C-terminal amino acid sequence with equivalent regions of other RyRs reveals a high level of overall amino acid homology (74% identity with D. melanogaster and between 47.9 and 50.1% with vertebrate isoforms). Homologies are however not uniformly distributed, though regions of high and low similarity are consistent with patterns in other RyR isoforms. The structural similarity of Hv-RyR with other RyRs is also indicated by comparison of hydropathy profiles and other previously described functional domains. Such results are consistent with this region of Hv-RyR containing the Ca(2+) channel itself and being intimately involved in RyR regulation.

Omega speckles - a novel class of nuclear speckles containing hnRNPs associated with noncoding hsr-omega RNA in Drosophila,10984439,,"Fluorescence RNA:RNA in situ hybridization studies in various larval and adult cell types of Drosophila melanogaster showed that the noncoding hsr-omega nuclear (hsromega-n) transcripts were present in the form of many small speckles. These speckles, which we name 'omega speckles', were distributed in the interchromatin space in close proximity to the chromatin. The only chromosomal site where hsromega-n transcripts localized was the 93D locus or the hsromega gene itself. The number of nucleoplasmic speckles varied in different cell types. Heat shock, which inhibits general chromosomal transcription, caused the individual speckles to coalesce into larger but fewer clusters. In extreme cases, only a single large cluster of hsromega-n transcripts localizing to the hsromega locus was seen in each nucleus. In situ immunocytochemical staining using antibodies against heterogenous nuclear RNA binding proteins (hnRNPs) like HRB87F, Hrp40, Hrb57A and S5 revealed that, in all cell types, all the hnRNPs gave a diffuse staining of chromatin areas and in addition, were present as large numbers of speckles. Colocalization studies revealed an absolute colocalization of the hnRNPs and the omegaspeckles. Heat shock caused all the hnRNPs to cluster together exactly, following the hsromega-n transcripts. Immunoprecipitation studies using the hnRNP antibodies further demonstrated a physical association of hnRNPs and hsromega transcripts. The omegaspeckles are distinct from interchromatin granules since nuclear speckles containing serine/arginine-rich SR-proteins like SC35 and SRp55 did not colocalize with the &ohgr; speckles. The speckled distribution of hnRNPs was completely disrupted in hsromega nullosomics. We conclude that the hsromega-n transcripts play essential structural and functional roles in organizing and establishing the hnRNP-containing omega speckles and thus regulate the trafficking and availability of hnRNPs and other related RNA binding proteins in the cell nucleus.",2000,"T K Rajendra, S C Lakhotia, A K Lal, K V Prasanth"

The decrease in the level of D. melanogaster female sex pheromone 7,11-heptacosadiene was dramatic and was correlated with an increase in 7-heptacosene. Females mutant for a gain-of-function allele had increased amounts of total hydrocarbons with wild-type proportions of dienes.

"Two medfly promoters that have originated by recent gene duplication drive distinct sex, tissue and temporal expression patterns",10978283,,"Genes encoding predominantly male-specific serum polypeptides (MSSPs) in the medfly Ceratitis capitata are members of a multigene family that are structurally similar to the genes encoding odorant binding proteins of insects. To study the transcriptional regulation of the genes MSSP-alpha2 and MSSP-beta2, overlapping fragments of their promoters, containing the 5' UTRs and 5' flanking regions, were fused to the lacZ reporter gene and introduced into the medfly genome via Minos-mediated germline transformation. Transgenic flies were functionally assayed for beta-galactosidase activity. Despite their extensive sequence similarity, the two gene promoters show distinct expression patterns of the reporter gene, consistent with previously reported evidence for analogous transcriptional activity of the corresponding endogenous genes. The MSSP-alpha2 promoter drives gene expression specifically in the fat body of the adult males, whereas the MSSP-beta2 promoter directs gene expression in the midgut of both sexes. In contrast, similar transformation experiments in Drosophila melanogaster showed that both promoters drive the expression of the reporter gene in the midgut of adult flies of both sexes. Thus, the very same MSSP-alpha2 promoter fragment directs expression in the adult male fat body in Ceratitis, but in the midgut of both sexes in Drosophila. Our data suggest that through the evolution of the MSSP gene family a limited number of mutations that occurred within certain cis-acting elements, in combination with new medfly-specific trans-acting factors, endowed these recently duplicated genes with distinct sex-, tissue-, and temporal-specific expression patterns.",2000,"G K Christophides, C Savakis, I Livadaras, K Komitopoulou"

Subsequently, branch fates are allocated within the tracheal placodes, prior to migration. Localized presentation of the FGF ligand, Branchless, to tracheal cells that express the FGF receptor, Breathless, guides migration.

Involvement of NRAMP1 from Arabidopsis thaliana in iron transport,10769179,,"Nramp genes code for a widely distributed class of proteins involved in a variety of processes, ranging from the control of susceptibility to bacterial infection in mammalian cells and taste behaviour in Drosophila to manganese uptake in yeast. Some of the NRAMP proteins in mammals and in yeast are capable of transporting metal ions, including iron. In plants, iron transport was shown to require a reduction/Fe(II) transport system. In Arabidopsis thaliana this process involves the IRT1 and Fro2 genes. Here we report the sequence of five NRAMP proteins from A. thaliana. Sequence comparison suggests that there are two classes of NRAMP proteins in plants: A. thaliana (At) NRAMP1 and Oriza sativa (Os) NRAMP1 and 3 (two rice isologues) represent one class, and AtNRAMP2-5 and OsNRAMP2 the other. AtNramp1 and OsNramp1 are able to complement the fet3fet4 yeast mutant defective both in low- and high-affinity iron transports, whereas AtNramp2 and OsNramp2 fail to do so. In addition, AtNramp1 transcript, but not AtNramp2 transcript, accumulates in response to iron deficiency in roots but not in leaves. Finally, overexpression of AtNramp1 in transgenic A. thaliana plants leads to an increase in plant resistance to toxic iron concentration.

A specificity and targeting subunit of a human SWI/SNF family-related chromatin-remodeling complex,11073988,10.1128/mcb.20.23.8879-8888.2000,"The SWI/SNF family of chromatin-remodeling complexes facilitates gene activation by assisting transcription machinery to gain access to targets in chromatin. This family includes BAF (also called hSWI/SNF-A) and PBAF (hSWI/SNF-B) from humans and SWI/SNF and Rsc from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However, the relationship between the human and yeast complexes is unclear because all human subunits published to date are similar to those of both yeast SWI/SNF and Rsc. Also, the two human complexes have many identical subunits, making it difficult to distinguish their structures or functions. Here we describe the cloning and characterization of BAF250, a subunit present in human BAF but not PBAF. BAF250 contains structural motifs conserved in yeast SWI1 but not in any Rsc components, suggesting that BAF is related to SWI/SNF. BAF250 is also a homolog of the Drosophila melanogaster Osa protein, which has been shown to interact with a SWI/SNF-like complex in flies. BAF250 possesses at least two conserved domains that could be important for its function. First, it has an AT-rich DNA interaction-type DNA-binding domain, which can specifically bind a DNA sequence known to be recognized by a SWI/SNF family-related complex at the beta-globin locus. Second, BAF250 stimulates glucocorticoid receptor-dependent transcriptional activation, and the stimulation is sharply reduced when the C-terminal region of BAF250 is deleted. This region of BAF250 is capable of interacting directly with the glucocorticoid receptor in vitro.

We show that a similar model can account for circadian oscillations in Neurospora, where the protein FRQ negatively regulates the expression of the frq gene. The effect of light on the circadian rhythms is included by considering that it elicits a rise in the rate of TIM degradation in Drosophila, whereas in Neurospora it enhances the rate of frq transcription. The models account for the occurrence of sustained circadian oscillations in continuous darkness in Drosophila and Neurospora. Numerical simulations further indicate that the periodic forcing of circadian oscillations by light-dark cycles can result either in the entrainment to the external periodicity or in aperiodic oscillations (i.e. chaos), depending on the magnitude of the periodic changes in the light-controlled parameter.",2000,"J C Leloup, A Goldbeter, D Gonze"

Interestingly, each TIR sequence consisted of a unique 9-bp terminal sequence and six tandem repeats of a sequence about 30 bp in length, like the foldback transposable element first identified in Drosophila. A homology search of databases and analysis by PCR revealed that a large number of Tnr8 members with sequence variations were present in the rice genome. Some of these members were not present at given loci in several rice species with the AA genome. These findings suggest that the Tnr8 family members transposed long ago, but some appear to have mobilized after rice strains with the AA genome diverged. The Tnr8 members are thought to be involved in rearrangements of the rice genome.",2000,"S Tsuchimoto, H Ohtsubo, E Ohtsubo, C Cheng"
Cooperative regulation of cell polarity and growth by Drosophila tumor suppressors,10884224,10.1126/science.289.5476.113,"Loss of cell polarity and tissue architecture are characteristics of malignant cancers derived from epithelial tissues. We provide evidence from Drosophila that a group of membrane-associated proteins act in concert to regulate both epithelial structure and cell proliferation. Scribble (Scrib) is a cell junction-localized protein required for polarization of embryonic and, as demonstrated here, imaginal disc and follicular epithelia. We show that the tumor suppressors lethal giant larvae (lgl) and discs-large (dlg) have identical effects on all three epithelia, and that scrib also acts as a tumor suppressor. Scrib and Dlg colocalize and overlap with Lgl in epithelia; activity of all three genes is required for cortical localization of Lgl and junctional localization of Scrib and Dlg. scrib, dlg, and lgl show strong genetic interactions.

Disruption of SMN function by ectopic expression of the human SMN gene in Drosophila,11113446,10.1016/s0014-5793(00)02243-2,"Spinal muscular atrophy is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations or deletions in the survival motor neuron (SMN) gene. We have cloned the Drosophila ortholog of SMN (DmSMN) and disrupted its function by ectopically expressing human SMN. This leads to pupal lethality caused by a dominant-negative effect, whereby human SMN may bind endogenous DmSMN resulting in non-functional DmSMN/human SMN hetero-complexes. Ectopic expression of truncated versions of DmSMN and yeast two-hybrid analysis show that the C-terminus of SMN is necessary and sufficient to replicate this effect. We have therefore generated a system which can be utilized to carry out suppressor and high-throughput screens, and provided in vivo evidence for the importance of SMN oligomerization for SMN function at the level of an organism as a whole.",2000,"Y B Chan, K E Davies, I Miguel-Aliaga, M van den Heuvel"
Construction for the modern head: current concepts in craniofacial development,11099568,10.1093/ortho/27.4.307,"The vertebrate head is a highly complex composite structure whose morphological characteristics are controlled at the level of the gene. There is now increasing evidence for the role of gene families that encode transcription factors in determining the embryonic plan of the developing craniofacial complex. These genes act as regulators of gene transcription being intimately involved with the control of complex interactions between multiple downstream genes. Combinatorial expression of the Hox genes (a family of highly conserved master regulatory genes related to the homeotic genes of the fruitfly Drosophila) have been shown to play a definitive role in patterning distinct regions of the craniofacial complex. In the vertebrate, Hox genes pattern the hindbrain and branchial regions of the developing head up to and including structures derived from the second branchial arch. The first branchial arch and more rostral regions of the head are patterned by groups of homeobox genes more diverged from the original Hox clusters. Transgenic mice, with targeted disruptions in many of these genes, are now providing insights into the molecular mechanisms that lie behind a number of craniofacial defects seen in man.",2000,M T Cobourne
"MSL1 plays a central role in assembly of the MSL complex, essential for dosage compensation in Drosophila",10619853,10.1093/emboj/19.1.144,"In male Drosophila, histone H4 acetylated at Lys16 is enriched on the X chromosome, and most X-linked genes are transcribed at a higher rate than in females (thus achieving dosage compensation). Five proteins, collectively called the MSLs, are required for dosage compensation and male viability. Here we show that one of these proteins, MSL1, interacts with three others, MSL2, MSL3 and MOF. The latter is a putative histone acetyl transferase. Overexpression of either the N- or C-terminal domain of MSL1 has dominant-negative effects, i.e. causes male-specific lethality. The lethality due to expression of the N-terminal domain is reduced if msl2 is co-overexpressed. MSL2 co-purifies over a FLAG affinity column with the tagged region of MSL1, and both MSL3 and MOF co-purify with the FLAG-tagged MSL1 C-terminal domain. Furthermore, the MSL1 C-terminal domain binds specifically to a GST-MOF fusion protein and co-immunoprecipitates with HA-tagged MSL3. The MSL1 C-terminal domain shows similarity to a region of mouse CBP, a transcription co-activator. We conclude that a main role of MSL1 is to serve as the backbone for assembly of the MSL complex.",2000,"J Heinrich, L L Pan, A L Knox, M J Scott, S B Cleland"
Mouse Peg9/Dlk1 and human PEG9/DLK1 are paternally expressed imprinted genes closely located to the maternally expressed imprinted genes: mouse Meg3/Gtl2 and human MEG3,11168589,10.1046/j.1365-2443.2000.00390.x,"Background: Genomic imprinting significantly influences development, growth and behaviour in mammals. Systematic screening of imprinted genes has been extensively carried out to identify the genes responsible for imprinted phenotypes and to elucidate the biological significance of this phenomenon. In this study, we applied DNA chip technology for isolating paternally expressed imprinted genes (Pegs). We compared the resulting expression profiles of parthenogenetic and fertilized control embryos to identify novel imprinted genes. Results: A novel paternally expressed mouse imprinted gene, Peg9/Dlk1, was identified. Consistent with this finding, the paternal expression of its human homologue, PEG9/DLK1, was also confirmed. These two genes form imprinted gene clusters with the reciprocally imprinted mouse Meg3/Gtl2 and human MEG3 genes that we first identified on distal chromosome 12 and chromosome 14q32, respectively. Conclusions: As DNA chip technology allows us to quickly screen a large number of genes, using this technology to search for imprinted genes could accelerate the identification of genes responsible for human and mouse genetic diseases. Dlk1 and DLK1, which encode transmembrane proteins, have six EGF-like repeats and show homology to the Delta gene in Drosophila melanogaster.

The human DMXL1 gene codes for a large mRNA of 11 kb with an open reading frame of 3027 amino acids. The putative protein belongs to the superfamily of WD repeat proteins, which have mostly regulatory functions. The DMXL1 protein contains an exceptionally large number of WD repeat units. The DMXL1 gene is located on chromosome 5q22 as determined by radiation hybrid mapping and fluorescence in situ hybridization.

Based on recent findings that the mammalian homologue of Drosophila Toll participates in LPS signaling, we examined the regulation of Toll-Like Receptor (TLR) gene expression by cytokines in vitro and its distribution in vivo with a focus on the liver as a site of host-microbe interaction. Our results show that IL-1beta and/or TNFalpha participate in the upregulation of TLR2 mRNA levels in hepatocytes. Rats treated concurrently with LPS and antagonists of the IL-1 or TNFalpha receptor demonstrated significantly reduced LPS-induced hepatic expression of TLR2 compared to animals treated with LPS alone. The increase in hepatic TLR2 mRNA expression was associated with enhanced transcription as determined by nuclear run-on analysis. LPS treatment in vivo caused a marked TLR2 mRNA up-regulation in all of the tissues examined, with liver showing the highest expression.

Ab initio gene finding in Drosophila genomic DNA,10779491,10.1101/gr.10.4.516,"Ab initio gene identification in the genomic sequence of Drosophila melanogaster was obtained using (human gene predictor) and Fgenesh programs that have organism-specific parameters for human, Drosophila, plants, yeast, and nematode. We did not use information about cDNA/EST in most predictions to model a real situation for finding new genes because information about complete cDNA is often absent or based on very small partial fragments. We investigated the accuracy of gene prediction on different levels and designed several schemes to predict an unambiguous set of genes (annotation CGG1), a set of reliable exons (annotation CGG2), and the most complete set of exons (annotation CGG3). For 49 genes, protein products of which have clear homologs in protein databases, predictions were recomputed by Fgenesh+ program. The first annotation serves as the optimal computational description of new sequence to be presented in a database. Reliable exons from the second annotation serve as good candidates for selecting the PCR primers for experimental work for gene structure verification. Our results shows that we can identify approximately 90% of coding nucleotides with 20% false positives. At the exon level we accurately predicted 65% of exons and 89% including overlapping exons with 49% false positives. Optimizing accuracy of prediction, we designed a gene identification scheme using Fgenesh, which provided sensitivity (Sn) = 98% and specificity (Sp) = 86% at the base level, Sn = 81% (97% including overlapping exons) and Sp = 58% at the exon level and Sn = 72% and Sp = 39% at the gene level (estimating sensitivity on std1 set and specificity on std3 set). In general, these results showed that computational gene prediction can be a reliable tool for annotating new genomic sequences, giving accurate information on 90% of coding sequences with 14% false positives. However, exact gene prediction (especially at the gene level) needs additional improvement using gene prediction algorithms. The program was also tested for predicting genes of human Chromosome 22 (the last variant of Fgenesh can analyze the whole chromosome sequence). This analysis has demonstrated that the 88% of manually annotated exons in Chromosome 22 were among the ab initio predicted exons.

Inhibition of IP(3) recycling using Li(+), or the inhibition of IP(3)Rs using xestospongin C, both resulted in the inhibition of SMCE activation following Ca(2+) store depletion using thapsigargin. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that endogenously expressed hTrp1 couples with IP(3)R type II, but not types I or III, in platelets with depleted intracellular Ca(2+) stores, but not in control, undepleted cells.

"Neurotransmitter levels and synaptic strength at the Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction are not altered by mutation in the sluggish-A gene, which encodes proline oxidase and affects adult locomotion",10992167,10.3109/01677060009083481,"The sluggish-A (slgA) gene of Drosophila melanogaster has been shown to encode for the enzyme proline oxidase, a mitochondrial enzyme which catalyzes the first step in the conversion of L-proline to L-glutamate. The slgA transcript is expressed in both larval and adult Drosophila melanogaster. Mutations in this gene lead to reduced proline oxidase activity and an elevation of free proline levels. Adult mutant flies show a striking reduction of motor activity. Since proline oxidase may contribute to the supply of the neurotransmitter glutamate in the nervous system, a reduction in proline oxidase activity could reduce neural glutamate pools and affect synaptic transmission in neurons utilizing glutamate as a transmitter, including peripheral motor neurons. We tested the hypothesis that glutamate, and synaptic transmission mediated by glutamate, are reduced at synapses of glutamatergic motor neurons in slgA mutants. Levels of glutamate and proline in different cell compartments, and functional properties of synaptic transmission were compared in slgA and control specimens. Proline is elevated in muscle cells of slgA mutants, indicating that the slgA gene regulates tissue proline levels. In nerve terminal varicosities, proline levels were low in both mutants and controls. Glutamate levels in nerve terminal varicosities of slgA mutants and controls were similar. In addition, we found that glutamatergic synaptic transmission at individual nerve endings and at the whole-cell level was similar in slgA mutants and controls. Thus, proline oxidase does not play a major role in generating neuronal glutamate pools at the Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction, and larval neuromuscular performance is not altered significantly in slgA mutants. Metabolic pathways other than that involving proline oxidase are able to sustain glutamatergic synaptic function in Drosophila larvae.",2000,"O P Ottersen, A Birinyi, H L Atwood, O Shupliakov, C E Hill, C K Govind, L Brodin, A J Shayan"

It encodes a putative ATP-dependent RNA helicase of the DEAD box protein family, with two rare substitutions in the PTRELA and the RG-D motifs, thought to be involved in oligonucleotide binding: serine for threonine, and lysine for arginine, respectively. Two mutant alleles of abstrakt show amino acid exchanges in highly conserved positions. A glycine to serine exchange in the HRIGR motif, which is involved in RNA binding and ATP hydrolysis, results in a complete loss of protein function; and a proline to leucine exchange located between the highly conserved ATPase A and PTRELA motifs results in temperature-sensitive protein function. Both the broad requirement for abstrakt gene function and its ubiquitous expression are consistent with a molecular function of the abstrakt protein in mRNA splicing or translational control.",2000,"P Yeghiayan, H Q Fan, H Jäckle, U Gaul, G Vorbrüggen, D Schmucker"
Age-specific effects of novel mutations in Drosophila melanogaster II.

We assayed for age-specific effects of mutations after 10, 20, and 30 generations of mutation accumulation. For mating ability, we found the strongest effects of mutations in the first half of the life span after 20 generations, and at nearly all ages by generation 30. These results are qualitatively consistent with results from a companion study in which age-specific mortality was assayed on the same lines of D. melanogaster. By contrast, effects of fecundity were confined to late ages after 20 generations of mutation accumulation, but by generation 30, as with male mating ability, effects of novel mutations were distributed across all age classes.

The role of anillin in meiotic cytokinesis of Drosophila males,10381388,,"Anillin is a 190 kDa actin-binding protein that concentrates in the leading edges of furrow canals during Drosophila cellularization and in the cleavage furrow of both somatic and meiotic cells. We analyzed anillin behavior during D. melanogaster spermatogenesis, and focused on the relationships between this protein and the F-actin enriched structures. In meiotic anaphases anillin concentrates in a narrow band around the cell equator. Cytological analysis of wild-type meiosis and examination of mutants defective in contractile ring assembly (chickadee and KLP3A), revealed that the formation of the anillin cortical band occurs before, and does not require the assembly of the F-actin based contractile ring. However, once the acto-myosin ring is assembled, the anillin band precisely colocalizes with this cytokinetic structure, accompanying its contraction throughout anaphase and telophase. In chickadee and KLP3A mutant ana-telophases the cortical anillin band fails to constrict, indicating that its contraction is normally driven by the cytokinetic ring. These findings, coupled with the analysis of anillin behavior in twinstar mutants, suggested a model on the role of anillin during cytokinesis. During anaphase anillin would concentrate in the cleavage furrow before the assembly of the contractile ring, binding the equatorial cortex, perhaps through its carboxy-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. Anillin would then interact with the actin filaments of the acto-myosin ring through its actin-binding domain, anchoring the contractile ring to the plasma membrane throughout cytokinesis.",1999,"M Gatti, S Bonaccorsi, M G Giansanti"
A critical role for cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) as a Co-activator in sterol-regulated transcription of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A synthase promoter,10026135,10.1074/jbc.274.9.5285,"3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) synthase, a key regulatory enzyme in the pathway for endogenous cholesterol synthesis, is a target for negative feedback regulation by cholesterol. When cellular sterol levels are low, the sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) are released from the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, allowing them to translocate to the nucleus and activate SREBP target genes. However, in all SREBP-regulated promoters studied to date, additional co-regulatory transcription factors are required for sterol-regulated activation of transcription. We have previously shown that, in addition to SREBPs, NF-Y/CBF is required for sterol-regulated transcription of HMG-CoA synthase. This heterotrimeric transcription factor has recently been shown to function as a co-regulator in several other SREBP-regulated promoters, as well. In addition to cis-acting sites for both SREBP and NF-Y/CBF, the sterol regulatory region of the synthase promoter also contains a consensus cAMP response element (CRE), an element that binds members of the CREB/ATF family of transcription factors. Here, we show that this consensus CRE is essential for sterol-regulated transcription of the synthase promoter. Using in vitro binding assays, we also demonstrate that CREB binds to this CRE, and mutations within the CRE that result in a loss of CREB binding also result in a loss of sterol-regulated transcription. We further show that efficient activation of the synthase promoter in Drosophila SL2 cells requires the simultaneous expression of all three factors: SREBPs, NF-Y/CBF, and CREB. To date this is the first promoter shown to require CREB for efficient sterol-regulated transcription, and to require two different co-regulatory factors in addition to SREBPs for maximal activation.",1999,"K A Dooley, M K Bennett, T F Osborne"

We show that Ras1-mediated signaling pathways in Drosophila are not influenced by Rap1 levels, suggesting that Ras1 and Rap1 function via distinct pathways. Moreover, a mutation that abolishes the putative cAMP-dependent kinase phosphorylation site of Drosophila Rap1 can still rescue the Rap1 mutant phenotype. Our experiments show that Rap1 is not needed for cell proliferation and cell-fate specification but demonstrate a critical function for Rap1 in regulating normal morphogenesis in the eye disk, the ovary and the embryo.

Ferritin was isolated from iron loaded hemolymph of C. ethlius fifth instar larvae by differential centrifugation. The N-terminal amino acid sequences for the nonglycosylated subunit with Mr 24,000 (S) and the largest glycosylated subunit with Mr 31,000 (G) were determined.

The G subunit most closely resembles the glycosylated ferritin subunit from Manduca sexta and the S subunit resembles the Drosophila small subunit. The S and G subunits from Calpodes were dissimilar and distinct from the cytosolic ferritins of vertebrates and invertebrates. Additional sequences were obtained by 5' and 3' RACE from separate fat body and midgut RACE libraries. cDNAs encoding both subunits had a consensus iron responsive element (IRE) in a conserved cap-distal location of their 5' UTR. An integrin-binding RGD motif found in the G subunit and conserved in Manduca may facilitate iron uptake through a calreticulin (mobilferrin)/integrin pathway.

Protein modules as organizers of membrane structure,10449334,10.1016/S0955-0674(99)80062-3,"Investigations conducted over the past 18 months have shed new light on how modular protein-binding domains, in particular PDZ domains, co-ordinate the assembly of functional plasma membrane domains. Members of the MAGUK (membrane-associated guanylate kinase) protein family, like PSD-95, use multiple domains to cluster ion channels, receptors, adhesion molecules and cytosolic signaling proteins at synapses, cellular junctions, and polarized membrane domains. Other PDZ proteins, like the Drosophila protein INAD and the epithelial Na(+)/H(+) regulatory factor (NHERF), organize cellular signaling by localizing transmembrane and cytosolic components to specific membrane domains and assembling these components into functional complexes. The organization of these proteins into discreet structures has functional consequences for downstream signaling.",1999,"J M Anderson, A S Fanning"
High sequence turnover in the regulatory regions of the developmental gene hunchback in insects,10028291,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a026107,"Extensive sequence analysis of the developmental gene hunchback and its 5' and 3' regulatory regions in Drosophila melanogaster, Drosophila virilis, Musca domestica, and Tribolium castaneum, using a variety of computer algorithms, reveals regions of high sequence simplicity probably generated by slippage-like mechanisms of turnover. No regions are entirely refractory to the action of slippage, although the density and composition of simple sequence motifs varies from region to region. Interestingly, the 5' and 3' flanking regions share short repetitive motifs despite their separation by the gene itself, and the motifs are different in composition from those in the exons and introns. Furthermore, there are high levels of conservation of motifs in equivalent orthologous regions. Detailed sequence analysis of the P2 promoter and DNA footprinting assays reveal that the number, orientation, sequence, spacing, and protein-binding affinities of the BICOID-binding sites varies between species and that the 'P2' promoter, the nanos response element in the 3' untranslated region, and several conserved boxes of sequence in the gene (e.g., the two zinc-finger regions) are surrounded by cryptically-simple-sequence DNA. We argue that high sequence turnover and genetic redundancy permit both the general maintenance of promoter functions through the establishment of coevolutionary (compensatory) changes in cis- and trans-acting genetic elements and, at the same time, the possibility of subtle changes in the regulation of hunchback in the different species.",1999,"F Bonneton, J M Hancock, G A Dover, P J Shaw"
EHD1--an EH-domain-containing protein with a specific expression pattern,10395801,10.1006/geno.1999.5800,"A cDNA that is a member of the eps15 homology (EH)-domain-containing family and is expressed differentially in testis was isolated from mouse and human. The corresponding genes map to the centromeric region of mouse chromosome 19 and to the region of conserved synteny on human chromosome 11q13. Northern analysis revealed two RNA species in mouse. In addition to the high levels in testis, expression was noted in kidney, heart, intestine, and brain. In human, three RNA species were evident. The smaller one was predominant in testis, while the largest species was evident in other tissues as well. The predicted protein sequence has an EH domain at its C-terminus, including an EF, a Ca2+ binding motif, and a central coiled-coil structure, as well as a nucleotide binding consensus site at its N-terminus. As such, it is a member of the EH-domain-containing protein family and was designated EHD1 (EH domain-containing 1). In cells in tissue culture, we localized EHD1 as a green fluorescent protein fusion protein, in transferrin-containing, endocytic vesicles. Immunostaining of different adult mouse organs revealed major expression of EHD1 in germ cells in meiosis, in the testes, in adipocytes, and in specific retinal layers. Results of in situ hybridization to whole embryos and immunohistochemical analyses indicated that EHD1 expression was already noted at day 9.5 in the limb buds and pharyngeal arches and at day 10.5 in sclerotomes, at various elements of the branchial apparatus (mandible and hyoid), and in the occipital region. At day 15.5 EHD1 expression peaked in cartilage, preceding hypertrophy and ossification, and at day 17.5 there was no expression in the bones. The EHD1 gene is highly conserved between nematode, Drosophila, mouse, and human. Its predicted protein structure and cellular localization point to the possibility that EHD1 participates in ligand-induced endocytosis.",1999,"A Fein, E Galperin, L Mintz, S Tulzinsky, A Joyner, M Horowitz, Y Bromberg, C A Kozak, M Pasmanik-Chor"
Functional characterization of thapsigargin and agonist-insensitive acidic Ca2+ stores in Drosophila melanogaster S2 cell lines,10579054,10.1054/ceca.1999.0043,"The role of acidic intracellular calcium stores in calcium homeostasis was investigated in the Drosophila Schneider cell line 2 (S2) by means of free cytosolic calcium ([Ca2+]i) and intracellular pH (pHi) imaging together with measurements of total calcium concentrations within intracellular compartments. Both a weak base (NH4Cl, 15 mM) and a Na+/H+ ionophore (monensin, 10 microM) evoked cytosolic alkalinization followed by Ca2+ release from acidic intracellular Ca2+ stores. Pretreatment of S2 cells with either thapsigargin (1 microM), an inhibitor of endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPases, or with the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin (10 microM) was without effect on the amplitude of Ca2+ release evoked by alkalinization. Application of the cholinergic agonist carbamylcholine (100 microM) to transfected S2-DM1 cells expressing a Drosophila muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (DM1) emptied the InsP3-sensitive Ca2+ store but failed to affect the amplitude of alkalinization-evoked Ca2+ release. Glycyl-L-phenylalanine-beta-naphthylamide (200 microM), a weak hydrophobic base known to permeabilize lysosomes by osmotic swelling, triggered Ca2+ release from internal stores, while application of brefeldin A (10 microM), an antibiotic which disperses the Golgi complex, resulted in a smaller increase in [Ca2+]i. These results suggest that the alkali-evoked calcium release is largely attributable to lysosomes, a conclusion that was confirmed by direct measurements of total calcium content of S2 organelles. Lysosomes and endoplasmic reticulum were the only organelles found to have concentrations of total calcium significantly higher than the cytosol. However, NH4Cl (15 mM) reduced the level of total calcium only in lysosomes. Depletion of acidic Ca2+ stores did not elicit depletion-operated Ca2+ entry. They were refilled upon re-exposure of cells to normal saline ([Ca2+]o = 2 mM), but not by thapsigargin-induced [Ca2+]i elevation in Ca(2+)-free saline.",1999,"N B Pivovarova, D B Sattelle, S B Andrews, S Yagodin"
Deletion analysis of the Drosophila Inscuteable protein reveals domains for cortical localization and asymmetric localization,10021388,10.1016/s0960-9822(99)80070-0,"The Drosophila Inscuteable protein acts as a key regulator of asymmetric cell division during the development of the nervous system [1] [2]. In neuroblasts, Inscuteable localizes into an apical cortical crescent during late interphase and most of mitosis. During mitosis, Inscuteable is required for the correct apical-basal orientation of the mitotic spindle and for the asymmetric segregation of the proteins Numb [3] [4] [5], Prospero [5] [6] [7] and Miranda [8] [9] into the basal daughter cell. When Inscuteable is ectopically expressed in epidermal cells, which normally orient their mitotic spindle parallel to the embryo surface, these cells reorient their mitotic spindle and divide perpendicularly to the surface [1]. Like the Inscuteable protein, the inscuteable RNA is asymmetrically localized [10]. We show here that inscuteable RNA localization is not required for Inscuteable protein localization. We found that a central 364 amino acid domain - the Inscuteable asymmetry domain - was necessary and sufficient for Inscuteable localization and function. Within this domain, a separate 100 amino acid region was required for asymmetric localization along the cortex, whereas a 158 amino acid region directed localization to the cell cortex. The same 158 amino acid fragment could localize asymmetrically when coexpressed with the full-length protein, however, and could bind to Inscuteable in vitro, suggesting that this domain may be involved in the self-association of Inscuteable in vivo.",1999,"J A Knoblich, L Y Jan, Y N Jan"
Wingless and Hedgehog pattern Drosophila denticle belts by regulating the production of short-range signals,10572045,,"The secreted proteins Wingless and Hedgehog are essential to the elaboration of the denticle pattern in the epidermis of Drosophila embryos. We show that signaling by Wingless and Hedgehog regulates the expression of veinlet (rhomboid) and Serrate, two genes expressed in prospective denticle belts. Thus, Serrate and veinlet (rhom) partake in the last layer of the segmentation cascade. Ultimately, Wingless, Hedgehog, Veinlet (an indirect activator of the Egfr) and Serrate (an activator of Notch) are expressed in non-overlapping narrow stripes. The interface between any two stripes allows a reliable prediction of individual denticle types and polarity suggesting that contact-dependent signaling modulates individual cell fates. Attributes of a morphogen can be ascribed to Hedgehog in this system. However, no single morphogen organises the whole denticle pattern.",1999,"M Lecourtois, J Vincent, C Alexandre"
Peripheral synapses at identifiable mechanosensory neurons in the spider Cupiennius salei: synapsin-like immunoreactivity,9931349,10.1007/s004410051208,"Indirect immunocytochemical tests were used at the light- and electron-microscopic levels to investigate peripheral chemical synapses in identified sensory neurons of two types of cuticular mechanosensors in the spider Cupiennius salei Keys.: (1) in the lyriform slit-sense organ VS-3 (comprising 7-8 cuticular slits, each innervated by 2 bipolar sensory neurons) and (2) in tactile hair sensilla (each supplied with 3 bipolar sensory cells). All these neurons are mechanosensitive. Application of a monoclonal antibody against Drosophila synapsin revealed clear punctate immunofluorescence in whole-mount preparations of both mechanoreceptor types. The size and overall distribution of immunoreactive puncta suggested that these were labeled presynaptic sites. Immunofluorescent puncta were 0.5-6.8 micrometer long and located 0.5-6.6 micrometer apart from each other. They were concentrated at the initial axon segments of the sensory neurons, while the somata and the dendritic regions showed fewer puncta. Western blot analysis with the same synapsin antibody against samples of spider sensory hypodermis and against samples from the central nervous system revealed a characteristic doublet band at 72 kDa and 75 kDa, corresponding to the apparent molecular mass of synapsin in Drosophila and in mammals. Conventional transmissionelectron-microscopic staining demonstrated that numerous chemical synapses (with at least 2 vesicle types) were present at these mechanosensory neurons and their surrounding glial sheath. The distribution of these synapses corresponded to our immunofluorescence results. Ultrastructural examination of anti-synapsin-stained neurons confirmed that reaction product was associated with synaptic vesicles. We assume that the peripheral synaptic contacts originate from efferents that could exert a complex modulatory influence on mechanosensory activity.",1999,"R Fabian-Fine, E Seyfarth, W Volknandt"
"A mammalian ortholog of Drosophila timeless, highly expressed in SCN and retina, forms a complex with mPER1",10231394,10.1046/j.1365-2443.1999.00238.x,"Background: It is now becoming clear that the circadian rhythm of behaviours and hormones arises from a rhythm at the level of gene expression, and that mammals and Drosophila essentially use homologous genes as molecular gears in the control of circadian oscillation. In Drosophila, the period and timeless genes form a functional unit of the clock and its autoregulatory feedback loop for circadian rhythm. However, in mammals, the counterpart of timeless has not been found. Results: We have isolated a mammalian homologue of timeless, mTim, from the mouse brain. mTim is highly expressed, with a weak or absent rhythm in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, the mammalian circadian centre. In the retina, mTim mRNA was found to be expressed with a circadian rhythm, and a particularly robust cycle was observed in the presence of light/dark cycles. We demonstrated that mTIM physically associates with mPER1 in vitro and in the nuclei of cultured COS7 cells. Conclusions: We have reported the isolation of the mouse timeless cDNA, the expression of the mTim mRNA and an interaction of mTIM with mPER1.

The function of vestigial in Drosophila wing development: how are tissue-specific responses to signalling pathways specified?,10472181,10.1002/(SICI)1521-1878(199907)21:7<542::AID-BIES2>3.0.CO;2-5,"The activities of conserved signal transduction pathways are central to the development of Drosophila wings, legs, and eyes. Yet, all these structures have characteristic morphologies, suggesting that additional factors provide organ-specific information. One excellent candidate for such a function is Vestigial, which activity promotes the formation of wings. The biochemical function of Vestigial is unknown, however, since no homologies with other proteins have been identified. Two recent reports show that Vestigial interacts with the transcription factor Scalloped, forming an active complex that binds to specific DNA sequences and regulates gene expression in cooperation with several signalling pathways. These results illustrate how tissue-specific transcription factors cooperate with general signalling pathways to regulate gene expression in a tissue-specific manner.",1999,J F de Celis
Evolutionary flux of P element regulation in a Drosophila melanogaster hybrid dysgenesis cline,10425917,10.1017/s0016672399003742,"Clines of P-induced hybrid dysgenesis provide a means for monitoring the evolution of transposition repression over space and time.

We have found that Q and M' populations of flies have increased their range within the cline at the expense of P lines. Q populations were found to be in the north of the cline and M' populations in the south. Some of the northern Q lines transmit repression through both sexes and type I deletion elements have been isolated from them. We suggest that these elements are responsible for Q type repression. The results support our model that populations made up of Q individuals with strong biparentally transmitted repression form an evolutionarily stable strategy for the repression of hybrid dysgenesis in Drosophila melanogaster.",1999,"D J French, P Corish, G A Dover, M Shi"
Identification of the mammalian homolog of the splicing regulator Suppressor-of-white-apricot as a thyroid hormone regulated gene,10521587,10.1016/s0169-328x(99)00212-0,"Mammalian brain development is controlled by thyroid hormone through the regulation of target genes. In this study, we describe for the first time that a splicing regulator gene is under thyroid hormone control in the rat brain during the critical period of neuronal differentiation. By differential display, we have identified the mammalian homolog of the Drosophila splicing regulator Suppressor-of-white-apricot (SWAP) as a thyroid hormone-regulated gene in an immortal line of rat neuroblasts, E18 cells. Using Northern blotting and in situ hybridization, we found that expression of SWAP is under thyroid control in the developing rat brain. SWAP gene expression is highest during the first 10 days of life (P0-P10), preferentially in cerebral cortex, cerebellum, subventricular epithelium, piriform cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, and caudate putamen. At later stages (P15-P30) SWAP expression decreases, being detectable only in the cerebellum, hippocampus, and layers II/III of cerebral and piriform cortexes. We found that hypothyroidism causes an abnormal high level of SWAP RNA expression at P5-P15 throughout the brain except the cerebellum. Significantly, thyroid hormone treatment in vivo of hypothyroid animals led to a normalization of SWAP RNA expression. Furthermore, similar hormone treatment caused a decrease in SWAP expression in control rats. By modulating the expression of SWAP and perhaps other splicing regulators thyroid hormone may exert wide regulatory effects on multiple genes. The regulation of SWAP gene defines a novel mechanism of action of thyroid hormone which can be important for its effects in the developing brain.",1999,"A Cuadrado, J Bernal, A Muñoz"
An analysis of transvection at the yellow locus of Drosophila melanogaster,9927457,,"Studies of a wide variety of organisms have shown that homologous sequences can exert a significant impact on each other, resulting in changes in gene sequence, gene expression, chromatin structure, and global chromosome architecture. Our work has focused on transvection, a process that can cause genes to be sensitive to the proximity of a homologue. Transvection is seen at the yellow gene of Drosophila, where it mediates numerous cases of intragenic complementation. In this article, we describe two approaches that have characterized the process of transvection at yellow. The first entailed a screen for mutations that support intragenic complementation at yellow. The second involved the analysis of 53 yellow alleles, obtained from a variety of sources, with respect to complementation, molecular structure, and transcriptional competence. Our data suggest two ways in which transvection may be regulated at yellow: (1) a transcriptional mechanism, whereby the ability of an allele to support transvection is influenced by its transcriptional competency, and (2) a structural mechanism, whereby the pairing of structurally dissimilar homologues results in conformational changes that affect gene expression.",1999,"R C Dunn, P K Geyer, J Chen, S T Filandrinos, C Wu, J R Morris, R Fisk"
The impact of developmental biology on cancer research: an overview,10728982,10.1023/a:1006304821464,"In recent years developmental biology has contributed a great deal to cancer research. This is in part because both fields address the question of how genes control the three-dimensional organisation of tissues, and how mutation of genes alters this. But also in recent years, the discovery that signalling pathways are conserved from worms to man, combined with the power of developmental biology's model organisms, principally Drosophila and C. elegans, to reveal signalling pathways that control tissue growth and organisation, has had a huge impact. Examples of this are the subject of the reviews in this issue, including the EGF-receptor, Wnt/APC/catenin, TGF-beta/Smad and hedgehog/patched/smoothened pathways, all of which were discovered and/or pieced together in model organisms, and all of which are disrupted by mutation in human cancer. Other topics considered are the control and execution of apoptosis; the search for tumour-suppressor-like genes in Drosophila; and genes of the Polycomb and Trithorax Groups that regulate the commitment of cells to patterns of differentiation, and that are among the targets for chromosome translocations. These stories illustrate how developmental biology has shown that there are many more signalling pathways relevant to neoplasia than the receptor tyrosine kinase pathways that first dominated the field; and that the signalling is more than just mitogenic or anti-mitogenic, and should be viewed as providing cells with information about their position and neighbours, that determines their role, differentiation and behaviour.",1999,P A Edwards
Drosophila and human RecQ5 exist in different isoforms generated by alternative splicing,10471747,10.1093/nar/27.18.3762,"Members of the RecQ helicase superfamily have been implicated in DNA repair, recombination and replication. Although the genome of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes only a single member of this family, there are at least five human RecQ-related genes: RecQL, BLM, WRN, RecQ4 and RecQ5. Mutations in at least three of these are associated with diseases involving a predisposition to malignancies and a cellular phenotype that includes increased chromosome instability. Metazoan RecQ helicases are defined by a core region with characteristic helicase motifs and sequence similarity to Escherichia coli RecQ protein. This core region is typically flanked by extensive, highly charged regions, of largely unknown function. The recently reported human RecQ5, however, has only the core RecQ-homologous region. We describe here the identification of the Drosophila RecQ5 gene. We recovered cDNAs corresponding to three alternative splice forms of the RecQ5 transcript. Two of these generate nearly identical 54 kDa proteins that, like human RecQ5, consist of the helicase core only. The third splice variant encodes a 121 kDa isoform that, like other family members, has a C-terminal extension rich in charged residues. A combination of RACE and cDNA analysis of human RECQ5 demonstrates extensive alternative splicing for this gene also, including some forms lacking helicase motifs and other conserved regions.",1999,"G M Rubin, J J Sekelsky, M H Brodsky, R S Hawley"
Insertions and deletions trigger adaptive walks in Drosophila proteins,22456880,10.1098/rspb.2011.2571,"Maps that relate all possible genotypes or phenotypes to fitness--fitness landscapes--are central to the evolution of life, but remain poorly known. An insertion or a deletion (indel) of one or several amino acids constitutes a substantial leap of a protein within the space of amino acid sequences, and it is unlikely that after such a leap the new sequence corresponds precisely to a fitness peak. Thus, one can expect an indel in the protein-coding sequence that gets fixed in a population to be followed by some number of adaptive amino acid substitutions, which move the new sequence towards a nearby fitness peak. Here, we study substitutions that occur after a frame-preserving indel in evolving proteins of Drosophila. An insertion triggers 1.03 ± 0.75 amino acid substitutions within the protein region centred at the site of insertion, and a deletion triggers 4.77 ± 1.03 substitutions within such a region. The difference between these values is probably owing to a higher fraction of effectively neutral insertions. Almost all of the triggered amino acid substitutions can be attributed to positive selection, and most of them occur relatively soon after the triggering indel and take place upstream of its site. A high fraction of substitutions that follow an indel occur at previously conserved sites, suggesting that an indel substantially changes selection that shapes the protein region around it. Thus, an indel is often followed by an adaptive walk of length that is in agreement with the theory of molecular adaptation.",2012,"Georgii A Bazykin, Alexey S Kondrashov, Evgeny V Leushkin"

Inhibitory control of synaptic and behavioral plasticity by octopaminergic signaling,22553037,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.6517-11.2012,"Adrenergic receptors and their ligands are important regulators of synaptic plasticity and metaplasticity, but the exact mechanisms underlying their action are still poorly understood. Octopamine, the invertebrate homolog of mammalian adrenaline or noradrenaline, plays important roles in modulating behavior and synaptic functions. We previously uncovered an octopaminergic positive-feedback mechanism to regulate structural synaptic plasticity during development and in response to starvation. Under this mechanism, activation of Octß2R autoreceptors by octopamine at octopaminergic neurons initiated a cAMP-dependent cascade that stimulated the development of new synaptic boutons at the Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ). However, the regulatory mechanisms that served to brake such positive feedback were not known. Here, we report the presence of an alternative octopamine autoreceptor, Octß1R, with antagonistic functions on synaptic growth. Mutations in octß1r result in the overgrowth of both glutamatergic and octopaminergic NMJs, suggesting that Octß1R is a negative regulator of synaptic expansion. As Octß2R, Octß1R functioned in a cell-autonomous manner at presynaptic motorneurons. However, unlike Octß2R, which activated a cAMP pathway, Octß1R likely inhibited cAMP production through inhibitory Goα. Despite its inhibitory role, Octß1R was required for acute changes in synaptic structure in response to octopamine and for starvation-induced increase in locomotor speed. These results demonstrate the dual action of octopamine on synaptic growth and behavioral plasticity, and highlight the important role of inhibitory influences for normal responses to physiological stimuli.",2012,"Vivian Budnik, Alex C Koon"

Drosophila americana was previously thought to have a stable demographic history, so that this evidence for a recent population expansion means that previous estimates of selection need revision. There was evidence for natural selection or BGC favouring GC over AT variants in introns, which is stronger for GC-rich than GC-poor introns. By comparing introns and coding sequences, we found evidence for selection on codon usage bias, which is much stronger than the forces acting on GC versus AT basepairs in introns.",2012,"Kai Zeng, Andrea J Betancourt, Sophie Marion de Procé, Brian Charlesworth"

Properties and secretory mechanism of Musca domestica digestive chymotrypsin and its relation with Drosophila melanogaster homologs,22808532,10.1016/j.ibmb.2012.03.005,"Musca domestica larvae present two different digestive chymotryptic activities found in the posterior midgut (PMG): one major soluble activity in the lumen and another minor present in cell membrane fractions. Both soluble and membrane-bound chymotryptic activities have different half lives of thermal inactivation (46 °C) in the presence and absence of 10 mM Triton X-100, indicating that they are two different molecular species. Purified soluble chymotryptic activity has pH optimum 7.4 and a molecular mass of 28 kDa in SDS-PAGE. It does not cleave short substrates, such as Suc-F-MCA, preferring longer substrates, such as Suc-AAPF-MCA, with a primary specificity (kcat/Km) for Phe rather than Tyr and Leu residues. In-gel activity revealed a unique band against S-AAPF-MCA with the same migration as purified chymotrypsin. One chymotrypsinogen-like sequence (MdChy1) was sequenced, cloned and recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli (DE3) Star. MdChy1 is expressed in the proximal posterior midgut (PMG1), as seen by RT-PCR. Expression analysis of other chymotrypsin genes revealed genes expressed at the anterior midgut (AMG) and PMG. Western blot of M. domestica midgut tissues using anti-MdChy1 antiserum showed a single band in samples from AMG and PMG, co-migrating with recombinant and purified enzymes. Immunogold labeling corresponding to Mdchy1 was found in small vesicles (thus indicating exocytosis) and in the lumen of AMG and PMG, corroborating the existence of two similar groups of chymotrypsins. Transcriptomes of M. domestica AMG and whole midgut prepared by pyrosequencing disclosed 41 unique sequences of chymotrypsin-like enzymes (19 probably functional), from which MdChy1 is highly expressed.

Tiny molecular beacons: LNA/2'-O-methyl RNA chimeric probes for imaging dynamic mRNA processes in living cells,22738327,10.1021/cb300178a,"New approaches for imaging dynamic processes involving RNAs in living cells are continuously being developed and optimized. The use of molecular beacons synthesized from 2'-O-methylribonucleotides (which are resistant to cellular nucleases) is an established approach for visualizing native mRNAs in real time. In order to spatially and temporally resolve dynamic steps involving RNA in cells, molecular beacons need to efficiently hybridize to their RNA targets. To expand the repertoire of target sites accessible to molecular beacons, we decreased the length of their probe sequences and altered their backbone by the inclusion of LNA (locked nucleic acid) nucleotides. We named these new LNA/2'-O-methyl RNA chimera oligonucleotides ""tiny molecular beacons"". We analyzed these tiny molecular beacons and found that the incorporation of just a few LNA nucleotides enables these shorter probes to stably anneal to more structured regions of the RNA than is possible with conventional molecular beacons. The ease of synthesis of tiny molecular beacons and the flexibility to couple them to a large variety of fluorophores and quenchers render them optimal for the detection of less abundant and/or highly structured RNAs. To determine their efficiency to detect endogenous mRNAs in live specimens, we designed tiny molecular beacons that were specific for oskar mRNA and microinjected them into living Drosophila melanogaster oocytes. We then imaged the live oocytes via spinning disk confocal microscopy. The results demonstrate that tiny molecular beacons hybridize to target mRNA at faster rates than classically designed molecular beacons and are able to access previously inaccessible target regions.",2012,"Irina E Catrina, Salvatore A E Marras, Diana P Bratu"
Acute ethanol responses in Drosophila are sexually dimorphic,23213244,10.1073/pnas.1218850110,"In mammalian and insect models of ethanol intoxication, low doses of ethanol stimulate locomotor activity whereas high doses induce sedation. Sex differences in acute ethanol responses, which occur in humans, have not been characterized in Drosophila. In this study, we find that male flies show increased ethanol hyperactivity and greater resistance to ethanol sedation compared with females. We show that the sex determination gene transformer (tra) acts in the developing nervous system, likely through regulation of fruitless (fru), to at least partially mediate the sexual dimorphism in ethanol sedation. Although pharmacokinetic differences may contribute to the increased sedation sensitivity of females, neuronal tra expression regulates ethanol sedation independently of ethanol pharmacokinetics. We also show that acute activation of fru-expressing neurons affects ethanol sedation, further supporting a role for fru in regulating this behavior. Thus, we have characterized previously undescribed sex differences in behavioral responses to ethanol, and implicated fru in mediating a subset of these differences.",2012,"Ulrike Heberlein, Anita V Devineni"
Oocyte destruction is activated during viral infection,22173880,10.1002/dvg.22004,"Viral infection has been associated with a starvation-like state in Drosophila melanogaster. Because starvation and inhibiting TOR kinase activity in vivo result in blocked oocyte production, we hypothesized that viral infection would also result in compromised oogenesis. Wild-type flies were injected with flock house virus (FHV) and survival and embryo production were monitored. Infected flies had a dose-responsive loss of fecundity that corresponded to a global reduction in Akt/TOR signaling. Highly penetrant egg chamber destruction mid-way through oogenesis was noted and FHV coat protein was detected within developing egg chambers. As seen with in vivo TOR inhibition, oogenesis was partially rescued in loss of function discs large and merlin mutants. As expected, mutants in genes known to be involved in virus internalization and trafficking [Clathrin heavy chain (chc) and synaptotagmin] survive longer during infection. However, oogenesis was rescued only in chc mutants. This suggests that viral response mechanisms that control fly survival and egg chamber survival are separable. The genetic and signaling requirements for oocyte destruction delineated here represent a novel host-virus interaction with implications for the control of both fly and virus populations.",2012,"Travis C Thomson, Joshua Johnson, Anette Schneemann"
Regulation of circadian behavioral output via a MicroRNA-JAK/STAT circuit,22305007,10.1016/j.cell.2011.12.024,"Although molecular components of the circadian clock are known, mechanisms that transmit signals from the clock and produce rhythmic behavior are poorly understood. We find that the microRNA miR-279 regulates the JAK/STAT pathway to drive rest:activity rhythms in Drosophila. Overexpression of microRNA miR-279 or miR-279 deletion attenuates rest:activity rhythms. Oscillations of the clock protein PERIOD are normal in pacemaker neurons lacking miR-279, suggesting that miR-279 acts downstream of the clock. We identify the JAK/STAT ligand, Upd, as a target of miR-279 and show that knockdown of Upd rescues the behavioral phenotype of miR-279 mutants. Manipulations of the JAK/STAT pathway also disrupt circadian rhythms. In addition, central clock neurons project in the vicinity of Upd-expressing neurons, providing a possible physical connection by which the central clock could regulate JAK/STAT signaling to control rest:activity rhythms.",2012,"Amita Sehgal, Wenyu Luo"
Identification of conserved splicing motifs in mutually exclusive exons of 15 insect species,22537296,10.1186/1471-2164-13-S2-S1,"Background: During alternative splicing, the inclusion of an exon in the final mRNA molecule is determined by nuclear proteins that bind cis-regulatory sequences in a target pre-mRNA molecule. A recent study suggested that the regulatory codes of individual RNA-binding proteins may be nearly immutable between very diverse species such as mammals and insects. The model system Drosophila melanogaster therefore presents an excellent opportunity for the study of alternative splicing due to the availability of quality EST annotations in FlyBase. Methods: In this paper, we describe an in silico analysis pipeline to extract putative exonic splicing regulatory sequences from a multiple alignment of 15 species of insects. Our method, ESTs-to-ESRs (E2E), uses graph analysis of EST splicing graphs to identify mutually exclusive (ME) exons and combines phylogenetic measures, a sliding window approach along the multiple alignment and the Welch's t statistic to extract conserved ESR motifs. Results: The most frequent 100% conserved word of length 5 bp in different insect exons was ""ATGGA"". We identified 799 statistically significant ""spike"" hexamers, 218 motifs with either a left or right FDR corrected spike magnitude p-value < 0.05 and 83 with both left and right uncorrected p < 0.01. 11 genes were identified with highly significant motifs in one ME exon but not in the other, suggesting regulation of ME exon splicing through these highly conserved hexamers. The majority of these genes have been shown to have regulated spatiotemporal expression. 10 elements were found to match three mammalian splicing regulator databases. A putative ESR motif, GATGCAG, was identified in the ME-13b but not in the ME-13a of Drosophila N-Cadherin, a gene that has been shown to have a distinct spatiotemporal expression pattern of spliced isoforms in a recent study. Conclusions: Analysis of phylogenetic relationships and variability of sequence conservation as implemented in the E2E spikes method may lead to improved identification of ESRs. We found that approximately half of the putative ESRs in common between insects and mammals have a high statistical support (p < 0.01). Several Drosophila genes with spatiotemporal expression patterns were identified to contain putative ESRs located in one exon of the ME exon pairs but not in the other.",2012,"Robert Loredo, John Tyree, Patricia Buendia, Shu-Ning Hsu"
"Cuticle refraction microscopy: a rapid and simple method for imaging Drosophila wing topography, an alternative readout of wing planar cell polarity",22218891,10.1007/978-1-61779-510-7_4,"The polarity of hairs on the adult Drosophila wing provides information about the planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling events that occur during pupal wing development. We have recently shown that PCP signaling also determines the orientation of cuticle ridges that traverse the surface of the adult wing membrane; a feature we call the wing membrane topography. Although hair polarity is uniform across the wild-type wing, ridge orientation differs between the anterior and posterior wing. Consequently, mapping wing topography can provide additional information about PCP signaling, rather than simply confirming observations of wing hair polarity. Wing membrane ridges can be imaged using scanning electron microscopy, however, significant preparation time and operator expertise are required. Here, we describe cuticle refraction microscopy, a rapid and simple light microscopy method for imaging Drosophila wing topography.",2012,"Justin Hogan, David Neff, Simon Collier"

A neuropeptide circuit that coordinates sperm transfer and copulation duration in Drosophila,23197833,10.1073/pnas.1218246109,"Innate behaviors are often executed in concert with accompanying physiological programs. How this coordination is achieved is poorly understood. Mating behavior and the transfer of sperm and seminal fluid (SSFT) provide a model for understanding how concerted behavioral and physiological programs are coordinated. Here we identify a male-specific neural pathway that coordinates the timing of SSFT with the duration of copulation behavior in Drosophila. Silencing four abdominal ganglion (AG) interneurons (INs) that contain the neuropeptide corazonin (Crz) both blocked SSFT and substantially lengthened copulation duration. Activating these Crz INs caused rapid ejaculation in isolated males, a phenotype mimicked by injection of Crz peptide. Crz promotes SSFT by activating serotonergic (5-HT) projection neurons (PNs) that innervate the accessory glands. Activation of these PNs in copulo caused premature SSFT and also shortened copulation duration. However, mating terminated normally when these PNs were silenced, indicating that SSFT is not required for appropriate copulation duration. Thus, the lengthened copulation duration phenotype caused by silencing Crz INs is independent of the block to SSFT. We conclude that four Crz INs independently control SSFT and copulation duration, thereby coupling the timing of these two processes.",2012,"Timothy D Tayler, Anne C Hergarden, Diego A Pacheco, Mala Murthy, David J Anderson"
Molecular mechanisms of aging and immune system regulation in Drosophila,22949833,10.3390/ijms13089826,"Aging is a complex process that involves the accumulation of deleterious changes resulting in overall decline in several vital functions, leading to the progressive deterioration in physiological condition of the organism and eventually causing disease and death. The immune system is the most important host-defense mechanism in humans and is also highly conserved in insects. Extensive research in vertebrates has concluded that aging of the immune function results in increased susceptibility to infectious disease and chronic inflammation. Over the years, interest has grown in studying the molecular interaction between aging and the immune response to pathogenic infections. The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is an excellent model system for dissecting the genetic and genomic basis of important biological processes, such as aging and the innate immune system, and deciphering parallel mechanisms in vertebrate animals. Here, we review the recent advances in the identification of key players modulating the relationship between molecular aging networks and immune signal transduction pathways in the fly. Understanding the details of the molecular events involved in aging and immune system regulation will potentially lead to the development of strategies for decreasing the impact of age-related diseases, thus improving human health and life span.",2012,"Ioannis Eleftherianos, Julio Cesar Castillo"
POLO ensures chromosome bi-orientation by preventing and correcting erroneous chromosome-spindle attachments,22389397,10.1242/jcs.092445,"Correct chromosome segregation during cell division requires bi-orientation at the mitotic spindle. Cells possess mechanisms to prevent and correct inappropriate chromosome attachment. Sister kinetochores assume a 'back-to-back' geometry on chromosomes that favors amphitelic orientation but the regulation of this process and molecular components are unknown. Abnormal chromosome-spindle interactions do occur but are corrected through the activity of Aurora B, which destabilizes erroneous attachments. Here, we address the role of Drosophila POLO in chromosome-spindle interactions and show that, unlike inhibition of its activity, depletion of the protein results in bipolar spindles with most chromosomes forming stable attachments with both sister kinetochores bound to microtubules from the same pole in a syntelic orientation. This is partly the result of impaired localization and activity of Aurora B but also of an altered centromere organization with abnormal distribution of centromeric proteins and shorter interkinetochore distances. Our results suggests that POLO is required to promote amphitelic attachment and chromosome bi-orientation by regulating both the activity of the correction mechanism and the architecture of the centromere.",2012,"Tatiana Moutinho-Santos, Claudio E Sunkel, Carlos Conde"
Specific Cooperation Between Imp-α2 and Imp-β/Ketel in Spindle Assembly During Drosophila Early Nuclear Divisions,22384376,10.1534/g3.111.001073,"The multifunctional factors Imp-α and Imp-β are involved in nuclear protein import, mitotic spindle dynamics, and nuclear membrane formation. Furthermore, each of the three members of the Imp-α family exerts distinct tasks during development. In Drosophila melanogaster, the imp-α2 gene is critical during oogenesis for ring canal assembly; specific mutations, which allow oogenesis to proceed normally, were found to block early embryonic mitosis. Here, we show that imp-α2 and imp-β genetically interact during early embryonic development, and we characterize the pattern of defects affecting mitosis in embryos laid by heterozygous imp-α2(D14) and imp-β(KetRE34) females. Embryonic development is arrested in these embryos but is unaffected in combinations between imp-β(KetRE34) and null mutations in imp-α1 or imp-α3. Furthermore, the imp-α2(D14)/imp-β(KetRE34) interaction could only be rescued by an imp-α2 transgene, albeit not imp-α1 or imp-α3, showing the exclusive imp-α2 function with imp-β. Use of transgenes carrying modifications in the major Imp-α2 domains showed the critical requirement of the nuclear localization signal binding (NLSB) site in this process. In the mutant embryos, we found metaphase-arrested mitoses made of enlarged spindles, suggesting an unrestrained activity of factors promoting spindle assembly. In accordance with this, we found that Imp-β(KetRE34) and Imp-β(KetD) bind a high level of RanGTP/GDP, and a deletion decreasing RanGTP level suppresses the imp-β(KetRE34) phenotype. These data suggest that a fine balance among Imp-α2, Imp-β, RanGTP, and the NLS cargos is critical for mitotic progression during early embryonic development.",2012,"Erika Virágh, Mátyás Gorjánácz, Tolga Eichhorn, István Kiss, Sowjanya Kallakuri, Bernard M Mechler, István Török, Tamás Szlanka"
Packaging the fly genome: domains and dynamics,22945596,10.1093/bfgp/els020,Two independent genomic approaches have recently converged to provide insight into the domain organization of the Drosophila genome. Genome-wide mapping of chromosomal proteins and histone modifications has generated detailed maps of the Drosophila chromatin landscape and has led to the identification of a number of different chromatin states and their distribution in domains across the genome. A remarkably similar domain organization is derived from whole genome mapping of chromatin interactions that reveals the segmentation of the genome into structural domains. This review focuses on our current understanding of this domain architecture which provides a foundation for our understanding of the link between chromatin organization and the dynamic activity of the genome.,2012,Rob White
Mechanical force alters morphogenetic movements and segmental gene expression patterns during Drosophila embryogenesis,22470437,10.1371/journal.pone.0033089,"The development of an organism is accompanied by various cellular morphogenetic movements, changes in cellular as well as nuclear morphology and transcription programs. Recent evidence suggests that intra and inter-cellular connections mediated by various adhesion proteins contribute to defining nuclear morphology. In addition, three dimensional organization of the cell nucleus regulate the transcription programs. However the link between cellular morphogenetic movements and its coupling to nuclear function in a developmental context is poorly understood. In this paper we use a point perturbation by tissue level laser ablation and sheet perturbation by application of force using magnetic tweezers to alter cellular morphogenetic movements and probe its impact on nuclear morphology and segmental gene expression patterns. Mechanical perturbations during blastoderm stage in a developing Drosophila embryo resulted in localized alterations in nuclear morphology and cellular movement. In addition, global defects in germ-band (GB) extension and retraction are observed when external force is applied during morphogenetic movements, suggesting a long-range physical coupling within the GB layer of cells. Further local application of force resulted in redistribution of non muscle myosin-II in the GB layer. Finally these perturbations lead to altered segmental gene (engrailed) expression patterns later during the development. Our observations suggest that there exists a tight regulation between nuclear morphology and cellular adhesive connections during morphogenetic movement of cells in the embryo. The observed spatial changes in patterning genes, with perturbation, highlight the importance of nuclear integrity to cellular movement in establishing gene expression program in a developmental system.",2012,"Abhishek Kumar, G V Shivashankar"
Drosophila Pez acts in Hippo signaling to restrict intestinal stem cell proliferation,22305752,10.1016/j.cub.2012.01.019,"The conserved Hippo signaling pathway acts in growth control and is fundamental to animal development and oncogenesis. Hippo signaling has also been implicated in adult midgut homeostasis in Drosophila. Regulated divisions of intestinal stem cells (ISCs), giving rise to an ISC and an enteroblast (EB) that differentiates into an enterocyte (EC) or an enteroendocrine (EE) cell, enable rapid tissue turnover in response to intestinal stress. The damage-related increase in ISC proliferation requires deactivation of the Hippo pathway and consequential activation of the transcriptional coactivator Yorkie (Yki) in both ECs and ISCs. Here, we identify Pez, an evolutionarily conserved FERM domain protein containing a protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) domain, as a novel binding partner of the upstream Hippo signaling component Kibra. Pez function--but not its PTP domain--is essential for Hippo pathway activity specifically in the fly midgut epithelium. Thus, Pez displays a tissue-specific requirement and functions as a negative upstream regulator of Yki in the regulation of ISC proliferation.",2012,"Roland Baumgartner, Suresh K Marada, Hugo Stocker, Ingrid Poernbacher, Kevin Edwards"

We performed divergent selection on replicate populations for only 14 generations, but had considerable power to differentiate alleles that evolved due to selection from those that evolved stochastically. We identified a large number of variants that changed frequency in response to selection for this simple behavior, and they are highly underrepresented on the X chromosome. Though our power was adequate using this experimental technique, the ability to differentiate causal variants from those affected by linked selection requires further development.",2012,"Thomas L Turner, Paige M Miller"
Phosphoinositide metabolism in Drosophila phototransduction: a coffee break discussion leads to 30 years of history,22283140,10.3109/01677063.2011.647144,"The aim of this review is to summarize the history of Dr. Yoshiki Hotta and his collaborators' contributions to the research field of Drosophila phototransduction. The electroretinogram-defective mutants reported in 1970 by Dr. Hotta and Dr. Seymour Benzer in the article entitled ""Genetic dissection of the Drosophila nervous system by means of mosaics"" have attracted the interest of many researchers, and have been used as a great tool to dissect the mechanisms underlying phototransduction. The early collaboration of Dr. Hotta with the group of Dr. Tohru Yoshioka, who was studying the roles of phosphoinositides in the nervous system biochemically, combined biochemical and genetic approaches to phototransduction-defective no receptor potential A (norpA) and retinal degeneration A (rdgA) mutants, which led to the hypothesis that phosphoinositide metabolism regulates phototransduction in Drosophila. This was proven later by the identification of the norpA and rdgA mutant genes, which encode phospholipase C and diacylglycerol kinase, respectively. Thus the collaboration of Dr. Hotta and Dr. Yoshioka laid the foundation of our understanding of the role of phosphoinositide metabolism in Drosophila phototransduction. In addition, a collaboration carried out with the group of Dr. Kazushige Hirosawa on the ultrastructural analyses of retinal degeneration mutants, rdgA and rdgB, led to the discovery of the subcellular membrane organelle called submicrovillar cisternae, which is involved in the phosphoinositide metabolism.

Evolution of foraging behaviour in response to chronic malnutrition in Drosophila melanogaster,22696523,10.1098/rspb.2012.0966,"Chronic exposure to food of low quality may exert conflicting selection pressures on foraging behaviour. On the one hand, more active search behaviour may allow the animal to find patches with slightly better, or more, food; on the other hand, such active foraging is energetically costly, and thus may be opposed by selection for energetic efficiency. Here, we test these alternative hypotheses in Drosophila larvae. We show that populations which experimentally evolved improved tolerance to larval chronic malnutrition have shorter foraging path length than unselected control populations. A behavioural polymorphism in foraging path length (the rover-sitter polymorphism) exists in nature and is attributed to the foraging locus (for). We show that a sitter strain (for(s2)) survives better on the poor food than the rover strain (for(R)), confirming that the sitter foraging strategy is advantageous under malnutrition. Larvae of the selected and control populations did not differ in global for expression. However, a quantitative complementation test suggests that the for locus may have contributed to the adaptation to poor food in one of the selected populations, either through a change in for allele frequencies, or by interacting epistatically with alleles at other loci. Irrespective of its genetic basis, our results provide two independent lines of evidence that sitter-like foraging behaviour is favoured under chronic larval malnutrition.",2012,"Sunitha Narasimha, Tadeusz J Kawecki, Roshan K Vijendravarma"

Activation and repression functions of an SR splicing regulator depend on exonic versus intronic-binding position,21914724,10.1093/nar/gkr713,"SR proteins and related factors play widespread roles in alternative pre-mRNA splicing and are known to promote splice site recognition through their Arg-Ser-rich effector domains. However, binding of SR regulators to some targets results in repression of splice sites through a distinct mechanism. Here, we investigate how activated and repressed targets of the Drosophila SR regulator Transformer2 elicit its differing effects on splicing. We find that, like activation, repression affects early steps in the recognition of splice sites and spliceosome assembly. Repositioning of regulatory elements reveals that Tra2 complexes that normally repress splicing from intronic positions activate splicing when located in an exon. Protein tethering experiments demonstrate that this position dependence is an intrinsic property of Tra2 and further show that repression and activation are mediated by separate effector domains of this protein. When other Drosophila SR factors (SF2 and Rbp1) that activate splicing from exonic positions were tethered intronically they failed to either activate or repress splicing. Interestingly, both activities of Tra2 favor the exonic identity of the RNA sequences that encompass its binding sites. This suggests a model in which these two opposite functions act in concert to define both the position and extent of alternatively spliced exons.",2012,"William Mattox, Manli Shen"
Comparison of parallel high-throughput RNA sequencing between knockout of TDP-43 and its overexpression reveals primarily nonreciprocal and nonoverlapping gene expression changes in the central nervous system of Drosophila,22870402,10.1534/g3.112.002998,"The human Tar-DNA binding protein, TDP-43, is associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and other neurodegenerative disorders. TDP-43 contains two conserved RNA-binding motifs and has documented roles in RNA metabolism, including pre-mRNA splicing and repression of transcription. Here, using Drosophila melanogaster as a model, we generated loss-of-function and overexpression genotypes of Tar-DNA binding protein homolog (TBPH) to study their effect on the transcriptome of the central nervous system (CNS). By using massively parallel sequencing methods (RNA-seq) to profile the CNS, we find that loss of TBPH results in widespread gene activation and altered splicing, much of which are reversed by rescue of TBPH expression. Conversely, TBPH overexpression results in decreased gene expression. Although previous studies implicated both absence and mis-expression of TDP-43 in ALS, our data exhibit little overlap in the gene expression between them, suggesting that the bulk of genes affected by TBPH loss-of-function and overexpression are different. In combination with computational approaches to identify likely TBPH targets and orthologs of previously identified vertebrate TDP-43 targets, we provide a comprehensive analysis of enriched gene ontologies. Our data suggest that TDP-43 plays a role in synaptic transmission, synaptic release, and endocytosis.

The actin-binding protein Canoe/AF-6 forms a complex with Robo and is required for Slit-Robo signaling during axon pathfinding at the CNS midline,22815517,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.6342-11.2012,"Axon guidance is a key process during nervous system development and regeneration. One of the best established paradigms to study the mechanisms underlying this process is the axon decision of whether or not to cross the midline in the Drosophila CNS. An essential regulator of that decision is the well conserved Slit-Robo signaling pathway. Slit guidance cues act through Robo receptors to repel axons from the midline. Despite good progress in our knowledge about these proteins, the intracellular mechanisms associated with Robo function remain poorly defined. In this work, we found that the scaffolding protein Canoe (Cno), the Drosophila orthologue of AF-6/Afadin, is essential for Slit-Robo signaling. Cno is expressed along longitudinal axonal pioneer tracts, and longitudinal Robo/Fasciclin2-positive axons aberrantly cross the midline in cno mutant embryos. cno mutant primary neurons show a significant reduction of Robo localized in growth cone filopodia and Cno forms a complex with Robo in vivo. Moreover, the commissureless (comm) phenotype (i.e., lack of commissures due to constitutive surface presentation of Robo in all neurons) is suppressed in comm, cno double-mutant embryos. Specific genetic interactions between cno, slit, robo, and genes encoding other components of the Robo pathway, such as Neurexin-IV, Syndecan, and Rac GTPases, further confirm that Cno functionally interacts with the Slit-Robo pathway. Our data argue that Cno is a novel regulator of the Slit-Robo signaling pathway, crucial for regulating the subcellular localization of Robo and for transducing its signaling to the actin cytoskeleton during axon guidance at the midline.",2012,"Andreas Prokop, Ana Carmena, Stephan Speicher, Jana Slováková, Natalia Sánchez-Soriano"
Modeling pathogenic mutations of human twinkle in Drosophila suggests an apoptosis role in response to mitochondrial defects,22952820,10.1371/journal.pone.0043954,"The human gene C10orf2 encodes the mitochondrial replicative DNA helicase Twinkle, mutations of which are responsible for a significant fraction of cases of autosomal dominant progressive external ophthalmoplegia (adPEO), a human mitochondrial disease caused by defects in intergenomic communication. We report the analysis of orthologous mutations in the Drosophila melanogaster mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) helicase gene, d-mtDNA helicase. Increased expression of wild type d-mtDNA helicase using the UAS-GAL4 system leads to an increase in mtDNA copy number throughout adult life without any noteworthy phenotype, whereas overexpression of d-mtDNA helicase containing the K388A mutation in the helicase active site results in a severe depletion of mtDNA and a lethal phenotype. Overexpression of two d-mtDNA helicase variants equivalent to two human adPEO mutations shows differential effects. The A442P mutation exhibits a dominant negative effect similar to that of the active site mutant. In contrast, overexpression of d-mtDNA helicase containing the W441C mutation results in a slight decrease in mtDNA copy number during the third instar larval stage, and a moderate decrease in life span in the adult population. Overexpression of d-mtDNA helicase containing either the K388A or A442P mutations causes a mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) defect that significantly reduces cell proliferation.

Formation of Tap/NXT1 heterodimers activates Tap-dependent nuclear mRNA export by enhancing recruitment to nuclear pore complexes,11739738,10.1128/mcb.22.1.245-256.2002,"The Tap protein has been shown to activate the nuclear export of mRNA species bearing retroviral constitutive transport elements and is also believed to play an essential role in the sequence nonspecific export of cellular mRNAs. However, it has remained unclear how Tap activity is regulated in vivo. Here, we report that the small NXT1/p15-1 protein functions as a critical cofactor for Tap-mediated mRNA export in both human and invertebrate cells. In the absence of NXT1 binding, the Tap protein is unable to effectively interact with components of the nuclear pore complex and both Tap nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and the nuclear export of mRNA molecules tethered to Tap are therefore severely attenuated. Formation of a Tap/NXT1 heterodimer enhances nucleoporin binding both in vitro and in vivo and induces the formation of a Tap/NXT1/nucleoporin ternary complex that is likely to be a key intermediate in the process of nuclear mRNA export. The critical importance of NXT1 for the nuclear export of poly(A)(+) RNA is emphasized by the finding that specific inhibition of the expression of the Drosophila homolog of human NXT1, by using RNA interference, results in the nuclear accumulation of poly(A)(+) RNA in cultured insect cells. These data suggest that NXT1 may act as a molecular switch that regulates the ability of Tap to mediate nuclear mRNA export by controlling the interaction of Tap with components of the nuclear pore.",2002,"Hal P Bogerd, Heather L Wiegand, Bryan R Cullen, Glen A Coburn, Yibin Kang, Yan Zeng"
The role of Math1 in inner ear development: Uncoupling the establishment of the sensory primordium from hair cell fate determination,11973280,,"During embryonic development of the inner ear, the sensory primordium that gives rise to the organ of Corti from within the cochlear epithelium is patterned into a stereotyped array of inner and outer sensory hair cells separated from each other by non-sensory supporting cells. Math1, a close homolog of the Drosophila proneural gene atonal, has been found to be both necessary and sufficient for the production of hair cells in the mouse inner ear. Our results indicate that Math1 is not required to establish the postmitotic sensory primordium from which the cells of the organ of Corti arise, but instead is limited to a role in the selection and/or differentiation of sensory hair cells from within the established primordium. This is based on the observation that Math1 is only expressed after the appearance of a zone of non-proliferating cells that delineates the sensory primordium within the cochlear anlage. The expression of Math1 is limited to a subpopulation of cells within the sensory primordium that appear to differentiate exclusively into hair cells as the sensory epithelium matures and elongates through a process that probably involves radial intercalation of cells. Furthermore, mutation of Math1 does not affect the establishment of this postmitotic sensory primordium, even though the subsequent generation of hair cells is blocked in these mutants. Finally, in Math1 mutant embryos, a subpopulation of the cells within the sensory epithelium undergo apoptosis in a temporal gradient similar to the basal-to-apical gradient of hair cell differentiation that occurs in the cochlea of wild-type animals.",2002,"Huda Y Zoghbi, Jane E Johnson, Neil Segil, Ping Chen"
Putative role for a myosin motor in store-operated calcium entry,12398417,10.1385/CBB:37:1:53,"Store-operated calcium (SOC) entry is the most prominent mode of calcium entry in nonexcitable cells, although important questions remain regarding its mechanism(s) of activation and the molecular identity of SOC entry channels. Recent work using Drosophila melanogaster and mammalian cells suggest that myosin may play a central role in regulation of the open state of SOC entry channels. The most direct evidence for such a role for myosin motor function is in the Drosophila rhabdomere, where a myosin homolog appears to terminate channel signaling. Studies directly examining the contribution of myosin to mammalian SOC entry are lacking. However, several indirect lines of evidence support a role for myosin motor function in the control of calcium entry. Both inhibition of myosin light-chain kinase (the kinase responsible for myosin activation) and disruption of filamentous actin (the track for actomyosin motor function) reduces SOC entry and appear to prevent activation of a calcium-selective SOC entry current. Thus, this review summarizes data-emphasizing recent evidence in mammalian systems-implicating myosin motor function in the control of SOC entry.",2002,"Natalie N Bauer, Troy Stevens"
Inhibition of Rho family GTPases by Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor disrupts cardiac morphogenesis and inhibits cardiomyocyte proliferation,11923206,,"Studies of Rho GTPases in Drosophila and Xenopus suggest that Rho family proteins may play an important role in embryogenesis. A reverse genetic approach was employed to explore the role of Rho GTPases in murine cardiac development. Cardiac-specific inhibition of Rho family protein activities was achieved by expressing Rho GDIalpha, a specific GDP dissociation inhibitor for Rho family proteins, using the alpha-myosin heavy chain promoter, active at embryonic day (E)8.0 during morphogenesis of the linear heart tube. RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42 activities were significantly inhibited, as shown by decreased membrane translocation of these proteins in the transgenic hearts. Transgenic F1 mice for each of two independent lines expressing the highest levels of the transgene, died around E10.5. Homozygotes of the middle copy-number lines, in which Rho GDIalpha expression was increased four-fold over normal levels, were also embryonic lethal. Cardiac morphogenesis in these embryos was disrupted, with incomplete looping, lack of chamber demarcation, hypocellularity and lack of trabeculation. Cell proliferation was inhibited in the transgenic hearts, as shown by immunostaining with anti-phosphohistone H3, a marker of mitosis. In addition, ventricular hypoplasia was associated with up-regulation of p21, an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases, and with down-regulation of cyclin A, while cell survival was not affected. These results reveal new biological functions for Rho family proteins as essential determinants of cell proliferation signals at looping and chamber maturation stages in mammalian cardiac development.",2002,"Robert J Schwartz, Kyoko Imanaka-Yoshida, Francesco J DeMayo, Song Zhan, Lu Wang, Michael D Schneider, Lei Wei"
Formation of neuroblasts in the embryonic central nervous system of Drosophila melanogaster is controlled by SoxNeuro,12183372,,"Sox proteins form a family of HMG-box transcription factors related to the mammalian testis determining factor SRY. Sox-mediated modulation of gene expression plays an important role in various developmental contexts. Drosophila SoxNeuro, a putative ortholog of the vertebrate Sox1, Sox2 and Sox3 proteins, is one of the earliest transcription factors to be expressed pan-neuroectodermally. We demonstrate that SoxNeuro is essential for the formation of the neural progenitor cells in central nervous system. We show that loss of function mutations of SoxNeuro are associated with a spatially restricted hypoplasia: neuroblast formation is severely affected in the lateral and intermediate regions of the central nervous system, whereas ventral neuroblast formation is almost normal. We present evidence that a requirement for SoxNeuro in ventral neuroblast formation is masked by a functional redundancy with Dichaete, a second Sox protein whose expression partially overlaps that of SoxNeuro. Genetic interactions of SoxNeuro and the dorsoventral patterning genes ventral nerve chord defective and intermediate neuroblasts defective underlie ventral and intermediate neuroblast formation. Finally, the expression of the Achaete-Scute gene complex suggests that SoxNeuro acts upstream and in parallel with the proneural genes.",2002,"Marita Buescher, William Chia, Fook Sion Hing"
Control of Drosophila imaginal disc development by rotund and roughened eye: differentially expressed transcripts of the same gene encoding functionally distinct zinc finger proteins,11874922,,"The Drosophila rotund gene is required in the wings, antenna, haltere, proboscis and legs. A member of the Rac family of GTPases, denoted the rotund racGAP gene, was previously identified in the rotund region. However, previous studies indicated that rotund racGAP was not responsible for the rotund phenotypes and that the rotund gene had yet to be identified. We have isolated the rotund gene and show that it is a member of the Krüppel family of zinc finger genes. The adjacent roughened eye locus specifically affects the eye and is genetically separable from rotund. However, roughened eye and rotund are tightly linked, and we have therefore also isolated the roughened eye transcript. Intriguingly, we show that roughened eye is part of the rotund gene but is represented by a different transcript. The rotund and roughened eye transcripts result from the utilization of two different promoters that direct expression in non-overlapping domains in the larval imaginal discs. The predicted Rotund and Roughened Eye proteins share the same C-terminal region, including the zinc finger domain, but differ in their N-terminal regions. Each cDNA can rescue only the corresponding mutation and show negative effects when expressed in each others domain of expression. These results indicate that in addition to the differential expression of rotund and roughened eye, their proteins have distinct activities. rotund and roughened eye act downstream of early patterning genes such as dachshund and appear to be involved in Notch signaling by regulating Delta, scabrous and SERRATE:",2002,"Juan P Couso, Susan E St Pierre, Maximo I Galindo, Stefan Thor"
Developmental changes in Drosophila melanogaster following exposure to alternating electromagnetic fields,12210559,10.1002/bem.10042,"This study investigated the biological effects of alternating electromagnetic fields (EMFs) on developmental stages of Drosophila melanogaster eggs and the first, second and third instar larvae stages. D. melanogaster eggs and larval stages were exposed to a 11 mT 50 Hz field produced by a pair of Helmholtz coils. Each stage was exposed to aEMFs for 2, 4, 6 and 8 h. Features of adult flies such as head, thorax, abdomen and other morphological changes were studied and compared. The frequency of abnormal flies was calculated using statistical methods at P <.05. The results obtained from exposing larvae in different stages of development showed a significant increase in the number of abnormal adult flies, whereas no significant increase was observed in the group arising from eggs exposed to aEMFs. Also, it appeared that duration of exposure correlates with the increase in the number of abnormal flies. There was no significant difference in mortality rate and sex distribution of the abnormal flies between field exposed and the control groups.",2002,"Ghadire Mirabolghasemi, Mahnaz Azarnia"
Comparative genomic analysis of equilibrative nucleoside transporters suggests conserved protein structure despite limited sequence identity,12384580,10.1093/nar/gkf564,"Equilibrative nucleoside transporters (ENTs) are a recently characterized and poorly understood group of membrane proteins that are important in the uptake of endogenous nucleosides required for nucleic acid and nucleoside triphosphate synthesis. Despite their central importance in cellular metabolism and nucleoside analog chemotherapy, no human ENT gene has been described and nothing is known about gene structure and function. To gain insight into the ENT gene family, we used experimental and in silico comparative genomic approaches to identify ENT genes in three evolutionarily diverse organisms with completely (or almost completely) sequenced genomes, Homo sapiens, Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster. We describe the chromosomal location, the predicted ENT gene structure and putative structural topologies of predicted ENT proteins derived from the open reading frames. Despite variations in genomic layout and limited ortholog protein sequence identity (< or =27.45%), predicted topologies of ENT proteins are strikingly similar, suggesting an evolutionary conservation of a prototypic structure. In addition, a similar distribution of protein domains on exons is apparent in all three taxa. These data demonstrate that comparative sequence analyses should be combined with other approaches (such as genomic and proteomic analyses) to fully understand structure, function and evolution of protein families.",2002,"Parween Abdulla, Jerry Machado, Narendra Sankar, Imogen R Coe, Arthur J Hilliker"
Suppressor of Fused represses Gli-mediated transcription by recruiting the SAP18-mSin3 corepressor complex,11960000,10.1073/pnas.082096999,"The Suppressor of Fused [Su(fu)] protein plays a conserved role in the regulation of Gli transcription factors of the hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway that controls cell fate and tissue patterning during development. In both Drosophila and mammals, Su(fu) represses Gli-mediated transcription, but the mode of its action is not completely understood. Recent evidence suggests that Su(fu) physically interacts with the Gli proteins and, when overexpressed, sequesters Gli in the cytoplasm. However, Su(fu) also traverses into the nucleus under the influence of a serine-threonine kinase, Fused (Fu), and has the ability to form a DNA-binding complex with Gli, suggesting that it has a nuclear function. Here we report that the mouse homolog of Su(fu) [mSu(fu)] specifically interacts with SAP18, a component of the mSin3 and histone deacetylase complex. In addition, we demonstrate that mSu(fu) functionally cooperates with SAP18 to repress transcription by recruiting the SAP18-mSin3 complex to promoters containing the Gli-binding element. These results provide biochemical evidence that Su(fu) directly participates in modulating the transcriptional activity of Gli.",2002,"J Michael Bishop, Steven Yan Cheng"
Role of histone H3 lysine 27 methylation in Polycomb-group silencing,12351676,10.1126/science.1076997,"Polycomb group (PcG) proteins play important roles in maintaining the silent state of HOX genes. Recent studies have implicated histone methylation in long-term gene silencing. However, a connection between PcG-mediated gene silencing and histone methylation has not been established. Here we report the purification and characterization of an EED-EZH2 complex, the human counterpart of the Drosophila ESC-E(Z) complex. We demonstrate that the complex specifically methylates nucleosomal histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3-K27). Using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we show that H3-K27 methylation colocalizes with, and is dependent on, E(Z) binding at an Ultrabithorax (Ubx) Polycomb response element (PRE), and that this methylation correlates with Ubx repression. Methylation on H3-K27 facilitates binding of Polycomb (PC), a component of the PRC1 complex, to histone H3 amino-terminal tail. Thus, these studies establish a link between histone methylation and PcG-mediated gene silencing.",2002,"Hediye Erdjument-Bromage, Yi Zhang, Li Xia, Ru Cao, Paul Tempst, Hengbin Wang, Liangjun Wang, Richard S Jones"
Little qualitative RNA misexpression in sterile male F1 hybrids of Drosophila pseudoobscura and D. persimilis,12223116,10.1186/1471-2148-2-16,"Background: Although the genetics of hybrid sterility has been the subject of evolutionary studies for over sixty years, no one has shown the reason(s) why alleles that operate normally within species fail to function in another genetic background. Several lines of evidence suggest that failures in normal gene transcription contribute to hybrid dysfunctions, but genome-wide studies of gene expression in pure-species and hybrids have not been undertaken. Here, we study genome-wide patterns of expression in Drosophila pseudoobscura, D. persimilis, and their sterile F1 hybrid males using differential display. Results: Over five thousand amplifications were analyzed, and 3312 were present in amplifications from both of the pure species. Of these, 28 (0.5%) were not present in amplifications from adult F1 hybrid males. Using product-specific primers, we were able to confirm one of nine of the transcripts putatively misexpressed in hybrids. This transcript was shown to be male-specific, but without detectable homology to D. melanogaster sequence. Conclusion: We tentatively conclude that hybrid sterility can evolve without widespread, qualitative misexpression of transcripts in species hybrids. We suggest that, if more misexpression exists in sterile hybrids, it is likely to be quantitative, tissue-specific, and/ or limited to earlier developmental stages. Although several caveats apply, this study was a first attempt to determine the mechanistic basis of hybrid sterility, and one potential candidate gene has been identified for further study.",2002,"Jane Reiland, Mohamed A F Noor"
"Underexpression of Gcm2, a master regulatory gene of parathyroid gland development, in adenomas of primary hyperparathyroidism",12354132,10.1046/j.1365-2265.2002.01627.x,"Objective: Glial cells missing (Gcm) was first identified as a binary switch between neuronal and glial determination in Drosophila. Two homologues of Drosophila Gcm have been identified in mice and humans, namely Gcm1 and Gcm2. Mouse Gcm2 is restricted to parathyroid tissues and Gcm2 was recently identified as a master regulatory gene of parathyroid gland development as Gcm2 knockout mice lack parathyroid glands. Design/patients: To identify Gcm2 transcripts in human non-neural tissues and to examine whether Gcm2 is involved in parathyroid gland tumorigenesis we analysed Gcm2 transcript levels in several non-neural tissues by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and performed real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis on five normal glands, 15 parathyroid adenomas of primary hyperparathyroidism (HPT) and nine hyperplastic glands of secondary HPT. Results: We found high Gcm2 mRNA expression in human parathyroid glands in comparison with other non-neural tissues and underexpression in parathyroid adenomas but not in lesions of HPT secondary to uraemia. Conclusion: Because adenomas demonstrate lower Gcm2 expression than normal glands we suggest that reduced expression of Gcm2 contributes to parathyroid gland tumorigenesis. We speculate that a proper expression level of the Gcm2 transcription factor could be important for maintaining a fully differentiated state of the parathyroid cell.",2002,"Göran Akerström, Pamela Correa, Gunnar Westin"
Cloning and molecular characterization of two mosquito iron regulatory proteins,11891134,10.1016/s0965-1748(01)00138-2,"Iron regulatory proteins (IRPs) control the synthesis of various proteins at the translational level by binding to iron responsive elements (IREs) in the mRNAs. Iron, infection, and stress can alter IRP/IRE binding activity. Insect messenger RNAs for ferritin and succinate dehydrogenase subunit b have IREs that are active translational control sites. We have cloned and sequenced cDNAs encoding proteins from the IRP1 family for the mosquitoes, Aedes aegypti and Anopheles gambiae. Both deduced amino acid sequences show substantial similarity to human IRP1 and Drosophila IRP1A and IRP1B, and all of the residues thought to be involved in aconitase activity and iron-sulfur cluster formation are conserved. Recombinant A. aegypti IRP1 binds to transcripts of the IREs of mosquito or human ferritin subunit mRNAs. No significant change in A. gambiae IRP1 messenger RNA could be detected during the various developmental stages of the life cycle, following iron loading by blood feeding, or after bacterial or parasitic infections. These data suggest that there is no change in gene transcription. Furthermore, bacterial challenge of A. gambiae cells did not change IRP1 protein levels. In contrast, IRP1 binding activity for the IRE was elevated following immune induction. These data show that changes in IRP1/IRE binding activity occur as part of the insect immune response.",2002,"D Zhang, A Wolf, F C Kafatos, G Dimopoulos, J J Winzerling, B Miñana"
A novel acetylcholinesterase gene in mosquitoes codes for the insecticide target and is non-homologous to the ace gene in Drosophila,12396499,10.1098/rspb.2002.2122,"Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is the target of two major insecticide families, organophosphates (OPs) and carbamates. AChE insensitivity is a frequent resistance mechanism in insects and responsible mutations in the ace gene were identified in two Diptera, Drosophila melanogaster and Musca domestica. However, for other insects, the ace gene cloned by homology with Drosophila does not code for the insensitive AChE in resistant individuals, indicating the existence of a second ace locus. We identified two AChE loci in the genome of Anopheles gambiae, one (ace-1) being a new locus and the other (ace-2) being homologous to the gene previously described in Drosophila. The gene ace-1 has no obvious homologue in the Drosophila genome and was found in 15 mosquito species investigated. In An. gambiae, ace-1 and ace-2 display 53% similarity at the amino acid level and an overall phylogeny indicates that they probably diverged before the differentiation of insects. Thus, both genes are likely to be present in the majority of insects and the absence of ace-1 in Drosophila is probably due to a secondary loss. In one mosquito (Culex pipiens), ace-1 was found to be tightly linked with insecticide resistance and probably encodes the AChE OP target. These results have important implications for the design of new insecticides, as the target AChE is thus encoded by distinct genes in different insect groups, even within the Diptera: ace-2 in at least the Drosophilidae and Muscidae and ace-1 in at least the Culicidae. Evolutionary scenarios leading to such a peculiar situation are discussed.",2002,"Nicole Pasteur, Michel Raymond, Philippe Fort, Arnaud Berthomieu, Mylène Weill, Marie Pierre Dubois"
Intron presence-absence polymorphism in Drosophila driven by positive Darwinian selection,12060758,10.1073/pnas.122570299,"Comparisons of intron-exon structures between homologous genes in different eukaryotic species have revealed substantial variation in the number of introns. These observations imply that, in each case, an intron presence-absence polymorphism must have existed in the past. Such a polymorphism, created by a recent intron-loss mutation, is reported here in a eukaryotic organism. This gene structure, detected in the jingwei (jgw) gene, segregates at high frequency (77%) in natural populations of Drosophila teissieri and is associated with a marked change in mRNA levels. Furthermore, the intron loss does not result from a mRNA-mediated mechanism as is usually proposed, but from a partial deletion at the DNA level that also results in the addition of four new amino acids to the JGW protein. Population genetic analyses of the pattern of nucleotide variation surrounding the intron polymorphism indicate the action of positive Darwinian selection on the intron-absent variant. Forward simulations suggest that the intensity of this selection is weak to moderate, roughly equal to the selection intensity on most replacement mutations in Drosophila.",2002,"Frédéric G Brunet, Daniel Lachaise, Manyuan Long, Josep M Comeron, Ana Llopart"

Although synapses were formed at contact sites between the axon terminals and target neurons, underlying cytoplasmic structures were not fully specialized at both pre- and postsynaptic terminals and synaptic vesicles appeared to accumulate at the presynapses.

Clock mechanisms in Drosophila,12111533,10.1007/s00441-002-0569-0,"Mechanisms underlying circadian clock function in Drosophila melanogaster have been revealed by genetic and molecular approaches. Two interlocked transcriptional feedback loops involving at least the period, timeless, Clock,and cycle genes generate molecular oscillations that are believed to control behavioral rhythmicity and other clock outputs. These oscillations are further enhanced and fine-tuned to match the duration of the solar day by post-transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms depending on the PERIOD and TIMELESS proteins and on the protein kinases DOUBLE-TIME and SHAGGY. Light is the principal zeitgeber for synchronizing molecular and behavioral rhythmicity via the blue-light photoreceptor CRYPTOCHROME and the TIMELESS protein. In addition, light seems required for maintaining robust molecular oscillations at least in peripheral clock-gene-expressing tissues like the eyes, antennae, or Malpighian tubules.

Insects appear to have only one multisubstrate deoxyribonucleoside kinase (dNK, EC 2.7.1.145), which prefers pyrimidine nucleosides, but can also phosphorylate purine substrates. When the structures of the human deoxyguanosine kinase (dGK, EC 2.7.1.113) and the dNK from Drosophila melanogaster were compared, a limited number of amino acid residues were identified and proposed to be responsible for the substrate specificity. Three of these key residues in Drosophila dNK were then mutagenized and the mutant enzymes were characterized regarding their ability to phosphorylate native deoxyribonucleosides and nucleoside analogs. The mutations converted the dNK substrate specificity from predominantly pyrimidine specific into purine specific. A similar scenario could have been followed during the evolution of kinases.

Kinesin I-dependent cortical exclusion restricts pole plasm to the oocyte posterior,12134163,10.1038/ncb832,"Microtubules and the plus-end-directed microtubule motor Kinesin I are required for the selective accumulation of oskar mRNA at the posterior cortex of the Drosophila melanogaster oocyte, which is essential to posterior patterning and pole plasm assembly.

Cortical binding of oskar mRNA seems to be dependent on the actin cytoskeleton.

Structural diversity of angiotensin-converting enzyme,16403023,10.1111/j.1742-4658.2005.05069.x,"The crystal structure of a Drosophila angiotensin-converting enzyme (ANCE) has recently been solved, revealing features important for the binding of ACE inhibitors and allowing molecular comparisons with the structure of human testicular angiotensin-converting enzyme (tACE). ACER is a second Drosophila ACE that displays both common and distinctive properties. Here we report further functional differences between ANCE and ACER and have constructed a homology model of ACER to help explain these. The model predicts a lack of the Cl(-)-binding sites, and therefore the strong activation of ACER activity towards enkephalinamide peptides by NaCl suggests alternative sites for Cl(-) binding. There is a marked difference in the electrostatic charge of the substrate channel between ANCE and ACER, which may explain why the electropositive peptide, MKRSRGPSPRR, is cleaved efficiently by ANCE with a low K(m), but does not bind to ACER. Bradykinin (BK) peptides are excellent ANCE substrates. Models of BK docked in the substrate channel suggest that the peptide adopts an N-terminal beta-turn, permitting a tight fit of the peptide in the substrate channel. This, together with ionic interactions between the guanidino group of Arg9 of BK and the side chains of Asp360 and Glu150 in the S(2)' pocket, are possible reasons for the high-affinity binding of BK. The replacement of Asp360 with a histidine in ACER would explain the higher K(m) recorded for the hydrolysis of BK peptides by this enzyme. Other differences in the S(2)' site of ANCE and ACER also explain the selectivity of RXPA380, a selective inhibitor of human C-domain ACE, which also preferentially inhibits ACER.

Mechanisms underlying the sperm quality advantage in Drosophila melanogaster,17133863,,"Contrary to early predictions of sperm competition theory, postcopulatory sexual selection favoring increased investment per sperm (e.g., sperm size, sperm quality) has been demonstrated in numerous organisms. We empirically demonstrate for Drosophila melanogaster that both sperm quality and sperm quantity independently contribute to competitive male fertilization success. In addition to these independent effects, there was a significant interaction between sperm quality and quantity that suggests an internal positive reinforcement on selection for sperm quality, with selection predicted to intensify as investment per sperm increases and the number of sperm competing declines. The mechanism underlying the sperm quality advantage is elucidated through examination of the relationship between female sperm-storage organ morphology and the differential organization of different length sperm within the organ.

Evidence that stem cells reside in the adult Drosophila midgut epithelium,16340959,10.1038/nature04371,"Adult stem cells maintain organ systems throughout the course of life and facilitate repair after injury or disease. A fundamental property of stem and progenitor cell division is the capacity to retain a proliferative state or generate differentiated daughter cells; however, little is currently known about signals that regulate the balance between these processes. Here, we characterize a proliferating cellular compartment in the adult Drosophila midgut. Using genetic mosaic analysis we demonstrate that differentiated cells in the epithelium arise from a common lineage. Furthermore, we show that reduction of Notch signalling leads to an increase in the number of midgut progenitor cells, whereas activation of the Notch pathway leads to a decrease in proliferation. Thus, the midgut progenitor's default state is proliferation, which is inhibited through the Notch signalling pathway. The ability to identify, manipulate and genetically trace cell lineages in the midgut should lead to the discovery of additional genes that regulate stem and progenitor cell biology in the gastrointestinal tract.",2006,"Norbert Perrimon, Craig A Micchelli"

Drosophila neuromuscular junctions were tested for effects of two known cAMP-dependent effectors: hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic nucleotide-regulated channels (HCNCs) and guanine nucleotide exchange protein activated by cAMP (Epac). Forskolin-induced enhancement of synaptic transmission was drastically reduced by a blocker of HCNCs, but not completely eliminated. A specific agonist for Epac modestly enhanced synaptic potentials. This agonist also stabilized their amplitudes in the presence of a blocker of HCNCs. The observations implicate HCNCs and Epac in cAMP-dependent potentiation that does not require cAMP-dependent protein kinase, indicating that additional previously unexplored factors contribute to synaptic plasticity in Drosophila. Genetic and molecular techniques available for Drosophila can be used to define the underlying molecular basis for cAMP-dependent synaptic potentiation.",2006,"H L Atwood, U Cheung, R S Zucker"
Compensatory proliferation in Drosophila imaginal discs requires Dronc-dependent p53 activity,16920621,10.1016/j.cub.2006.07.046,"Background: The p53 transcription factor directs a transcriptional program that determines whether a cell lives or dies after DNA damage. Animal survival after extensive cellular damage often requires that lost tissue be replaced through compensatory growth or regeneration. In Drosophila, damaged imaginal disc cells can induce the proliferation of neighboring viable cells, but how this is controlled is not clear. Here we provide evidence that Drosophila p53 (dp53) has a previously unidentified role in coordinating the compensatory growth response to tissue damage. Results: We find that dp53, the sole p53 ortholog in Drosophila, is required for each component of the response to cellular damage, including two separate cell-cycle arrests, changes in patterning gene expression, cell proliferation, and growth. We demonstrate that these processes are regulated by dp53 in a manner that is independent of DNA-damage sensing but that requires the initiator caspase Dronc. Our results indicate that once induced, dp53 amplifies and sustains the response through a positive feedback loop with Dronc and the apoptosis-inducing factors Hid and Reaper. Conclusions: How cell death and cell proliferation are coordinated during development and after stress is a fundamental question that is critical for an understanding of growth regulation. Our data suggest that dp53 may carry out an ancestral function that promotes animal survival through the coordination of responses leading to compensatory growth after tissue damage.",2006,"Laura A Johnston, Brent S Wells, Eri Yoshida"
Identification of novel chondroitin proteoglycans in Caenorhabditis elegans: embryonic cell division depends on CPG-1 and CPG-2,16785326,10.1083/jcb.200603003,"Vertebrates produce multiple chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans that play important roles in development and tissue mechanics. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the chondroitin chains lack sulfate but nevertheless play essential roles in embryonic development and vulval morphogenesis. However, assignment of these functions to specific proteoglycans has been limited by the lack of identified core proteins. We used a combination of biochemical purification, Western blotting, and mass spectrometry to identify nine C. elegans chondroitin proteoglycan core proteins, none of which have homologues in vertebrates or other invertebrates such as Drosophila melanogaster or Hydra vulgaris. CPG-1/CEJ-1 and CPG-2 are expressed during embryonic development and bind chitin, suggesting a structural role in the egg. RNA interference (RNAi) depletion of individual CPGs had no effect on embryonic viability, but simultaneous depletion of CPG-1/CEJ-1 and CPG-2 resulted in multinucleated single-cell embryos. This embryonic lethality phenocopies RNAi depletion of the SQV-5 chondroitin synthase, suggesting that chondroitin chains on these two proteoglycans are required for cytokinesis.",2006,"John R Yates, Karen Oegema, Jeffrey D Esko, Sara K Olson, Joseph R Bishop"
Expression pattern of Bombyx vasa-like (BmVLG) protein and its implications in germ cell development,16261344,10.1007/s00427-005-0033-8,"Germ cell development in the silkworm Bombyx mori is interesting in that the species has no recognizable germ plasm, and its germ cells appear first on the ventral side of the embryo, not on the posterior pole as in Drosophila melanogaster. We previously reported the isolation of a vasa homologue (BmVLG) from B. mori and revealed the specific expression of transcript in the germ cells. In this paper, we describe the embryonic expression pattern of BmVLG protein. Consistent with the lack of recognizable germ plasm, the protein is not localized in freshly laid eggs, and its specific expression is first detectable several hours after energids penetrate the periplasm. This is in contrast to D. melanogaster, where germ cell lineage can be traced with anti-vasa antibody just after the formation of pole cells as they sequester vasa-positive germ (pole) plasm during cellularization. It is also revealed that, within the first few hours of their appearance when extensive cell movement does not seem to occur, stained cells are sometimes widely dispersed along the midline, which eventually may lead to the formation of ectopic germ cells. The implications of these results for germ cell development are discussed.",2006,"Hajime Nakao, Masami Shimoda, Masatsugu Hatakeyama, Toshio Kanda, Jae Min Lee"
"Lgl, Pins and aPKC regulate neuroblast self-renewal versus differentiation",16357871,10.1038/nature04299,"How a cell chooses to proliferate or to differentiate is an important issue in stem cell and cancer biology. Drosophila neuroblasts undergo self-renewal with every cell division, producing another neuroblast and a differentiating daughter cell, but the mechanisms controlling the self-renewal/differentiation decision are poorly understood. Here we tested whether cell polarity genes, known to regulate embryonic neuroblast asymmetric cell division, also regulate neuroblast self-renewal. Clonal analysis in larval brains showed that pins mutant neuroblasts rapidly fail to self-renew, whereas lethal giant larvae (lgl) mutant neuroblasts generate multiple neuroblasts. Notably, lgl pins double mutant neuroblasts all divide symmetrically to self-renew, filling the brain with neuroblasts at the expense of neurons. The lgl pins neuroblasts show ectopic cortical localization of atypical protein kinase C (aPKC), and a decrease in aPKC expression reduces neuroblast numbers, suggesting that aPKC promotes neuroblast self-renewal. In support of this hypothesis, neuroblast-specific overexpression of membrane-targeted aPKC, but not a kinase-dead version, induces ectopic neuroblast self-renewal. We conclude that cortical aPKC kinase activity is a potent inducer of neuroblast self-renewal.",2006,"Kristin J Robinson, Chris Q Doe, Cheng-Yu Lee"
Tandem Sp1/Sp3 sites together with an Ets-1 site cooperate to mediate alpha11 integrin chain expression in mesenchymal cells,16300938,10.1016/j.matbio.2005.10.002,"Alpha11beta1 integrin is a collagen receptor, which is expressed in a highly regulated manner in a specific subset of ectomesenchymally and mesodermally derived cells. We previously established that a 3 kb region upstream of the transcription start site of the ITGA11 gene efficiently induced alpha11 transcription in a cell-type specific manner. Using the human fibrosarcoma cell line HT1080 and human skin fibroblasts, we now report that the majority of the activity in the proximal promoter resides in a region spanning nt +25 to nt -176. Mutation and deletion analyses using luciferase reporter assays showed that tandem low affinity Sp1/Sp3 binding sites, together with an Ets-1-like binding site, were needed for the proximal promoter activity in mesenchymal cells. EMSAs and supershift assays showed that Sp1 and Sp3 both bind to the Sp1/Sp3 binding sites, whereas occupation of the Ets-1 binding site appears to be Sp3-dependent. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays verified that Sp1, Sp3 and Ets-1 can bind the promoter in vivo. In heterologous Drosophila SL2 cells, Sp1, Sp3 and Ets-1 all transactivated the alpha11 promoter, with Sp1 being the most efficient activator. The lack of any synergistic effect of Sp1/Sp3 and Ets-1 in SL2 cells indicates that an Ets family member other than Ets-1 might be involved in regulating alpha11 transcription in mesenchymal cells. The central role of Sp1 in regulating alpha11 RNA transcription was further verified by the ability of the Sp1 inhibitor mithramycin A to efficiently attenuate alpha11 RNA and protein levels in primary fibroblasts. The proximal promoter itself was able to confer cell-type specific transcription on HT1080 cells and embryonic fibroblasts but not on U2OS and JAR cells. We speculate that the ""mesenchymal signature"" of alpha11 integrin gene expression is controlled by the activity of Sp1/Sp3, fibroblast-specific combinations of Ets family members and yet unidentified enhancer-binding transcription factors.",2006,"Rainer Heuchel, Malgorzata Barczyk, Donald Gullberg, Ning Lu, Wan-Ming Zhang"
Heteromerization of innexin gap junction proteins regulates epithelial tissue organization in Drosophila,16436513,10.1091/mbc.e05-11-1059,"Gap junctions consist of clusters of intercellular channels, which enable direct cell-to-cell communication and adhesion in animals. Whereas deuterostomes, including all vertebrates, use members of the connexin and pannexin multiprotein families to assemble gap junction channels, protostomes such as Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans use members of the innexin protein family. The molecular composition of innexin-containing gap junctions and the functional significance of innexin oligomerization for development are largely unknown. Here, we report that heteromerization of Drosophila innexins 2 and 3 is crucial for epithelial organization and polarity of the embryonic epidermis. Both innexins colocalize in epithelial cell membranes. Innexin3 is mislocalized to the cytoplasm in innexin2 mutants and is recruited into ectopic expression domains defined by innexin2 misexpression. Conversely, RNA interference (RNAi) knockdown of innexin3 causes mislocalization of innexin2 and of DE-cadherin, causing cell polarity defects in the epidermis. Biochemical interaction studies, surface plasmon resonance analysis, transgenesis, and biochemical fractionation experiments demonstrate that both innexins interact via their C-terminal cytoplasmic domains during the assembly of heteromeric channels. Our data provide the first molecular and functional demonstration that innexin heteromerization occurs in vivo and reveal insight into a molecular mechanism by which innexins may oligomerize into heteromeric gap junction channels.",2006,"Martin Knieps, Sonja Herrmann, Birgit Löer, Corinna Lehmann, Hildegard Lechner, Michael Hoch, Reinhard Bauer, Michael Famulok"
"Loss of glial lazarillo, a homolog of apolipoprotein D, reduces lifespan and stress resistance in Drosophila",16581513,10.1016/j.cub.2006.03.024,"The vertebrate Apolipoprotein D (ApoD) is a lipocalin secreted from subsets of neurons and glia during neural development and aging . A strong correlation exists between ApoD overexpression and numerous nervous system pathologies as well as obesity, diabetes, and many forms of cancer . However, the exact relationship between the function of ApoD and the pathophysiology of these diseases is still unknown. We have generated loss-of-function Drosophila mutants for the Glial Lazarillo (GLaz) gene , a homolog of ApoD in the fruit fly, mainly expressed in subsets of adult glial cells. The absence of GLaz reduces the organism's resistance to oxidative stress and starvation and shortens male lifespan. The mutant flies exhibit a smaller body mass due to a lower amount of neutral lipids stored in the fat body. Apoptotic neural cell death increases in aged flies or upon paraquat treatment, which also impairs neural function as assessed by behavioral tests. The higher sensitivity to oxidative stress and starvation and the reduced fat storage revert to control levels when a GFP-GLaz fusion protein is expressed under the control of the GLaz natural promoter. Finally, GLaz mutants have a higher concentration of lipid peroxidation products, pointing to a lipid peroxidation protection or scavenging as the mechanism of action for this lipocalin. In agreement with Walker et al. (, in this issue of Current Biology), who analyze the effects of overexpressing GLaz, we conclude that GLaz has a protective role in stress situations and that its absence reduces lifespan and accelerates neurodegeneration.",2006,"Xiaohui Wang, Diego Sanchez, Maria D Ganfornina, Laura Torroja, Begoña López-Arias, Inmaculada Canal, Michael J Bastiani"
Milton controls the early acquisition of mitochondria by Drosophila oocytes,16887820,10.1242/dev.02514,"Mitochondria in many species enter the young oocyte en mass from interconnected germ cells to generate the large aggregate known as the Balbiani body. Organelles and germ plasm components frequently associate with this structure. Balbiani body mitochondria are thought to populate the germ line, ensuring that their genomes will be inherited preferentially. We find that milton, a gene whose product was previously shown to associate with Kinesin and to mediate axonal transport of mitochondria, is needed to form a normal Balbiani body. In addition, germ cells mutant for some milton or Kinesin heavy chain (Khc) alleles transport mitochondria to the oocyte prematurely and excessively, without disturbing Balbiani body-associated components. Our observations show that the oocyte acquires the majority of its mitochondria by competitive bidirectional transport along microtubules mediated by the Milton adaptor. These experiments provide a molecular explanation for Balbiani body formation and, surprisingly, show that viable fertile offspring can be obtained from eggs in which the normal program of mitochondrial acquisition has been severely perturbed.",2006,"Rachel T Cox, Allan C Spradling"
Myostatin regulates cardiomyocyte growth through modulation of Akt signaling,16763166,10.1161/01.RES.0000231290.45676.d4,"Myostatin is a highly conserved, potent negative regulator of skeletal muscle hypertrophy in many species, from rodents to humans, although its mechanisms of action are incompletely understood. Transcript profiling of hearts from a genetic model of cardiac hypertrophy revealed dramatic upregulation of myostatin, not previously recognized to play a role in the heart. Here we show that myostatin abrogates the cardiomyocyte growth response to phenylephrine in vitro through inhibition of p38 and the serine-threonine kinase Akt, a critical determinant of cell size in many species from drosophila to mammals. Evaluation of male myostatin-null mice revealed that their cardiomyocytes and hearts overall were slightly smaller at baseline than littermate controls but exhibited more exuberant growth in response to chronic phenylephrine infusion. The increased cardiac growth in myostatin-null mice corresponded with increased p38 phosphorylation and Akt activation in vivo after phenylephrine treatment.

Here we present a genome-wide study of gene expression changes during hypoxia and then functionally test a subset of these genes for roles in survival and recovery from hypoxia. We found 79 genes with increased mRNA levels when adult flies were treated with 0.5% O2 for 6 h. A subset of these genes had detectably increased levels in as short as 1 h of low-oxygen treatment. Mild hypoxia levels resulted in an increase in transcription levels for only 20 genes. Viability during hypoxia and recovery time from hypoxia-induced paralysis was examined in flies with a reduction in activity in hypoxia-response genes.

In particular, they stress that recent experiments by Lucchetta [Nature (London) 434, 1134 (2005)], where embryos whose anterior and posterior halves develop at different temperatures still show excellent precision in the hb boundary, are in good agreement with such a model. We would like to show here that this conclusion is unwarranted. This is because the experiments of Lucchetta were done at different temperatures from those studied in the model. Since in other temperature combinations the model does not produce precise boundaries and there are no systematic trends in these deviations, a comparison to the experiment is not possible. Furthermore, we would like to point out that any correlated bigradient model should also take into account the fluctuations of the bicoid profile within an embryo. When forming correlated bigradients of experimental profiles from an online library, we observe that these intraembryo variations destroy robustness of the hb boundary even in the wild-type situation.",2006,"Tinri Aegerter-Wilmsen, Christof M Aegerter"

We now extend the model to include a recently demonstrated feedback loop between the TOC1 homologues PSEUDO-RESPONSE REGULATOR 7 (PRR7), PRR9 and LHY and CCA1. This three-loop network explains the rhythmic phenotype of toc1 mutant alleles. Model predictions fit closely to new data on the gi;lhy;cca1 mutant, which confirm that GI is a major contributor to Y function.

Androcam is a tissue-specific light chain for myosin VI in the Drosophila testis,16790438,10.1074/jbc.M602094200,"Myosin VI, a ubiquitously expressed unconventional myosin, has roles in a broad array of biological processes. Unusual for this motor family, myosin VI moves toward the minus (pointed) end of actin filaments. Myosin VI has two light chain binding sites that can both bind calmodulin (CaM). However unconventional myosins could use tissue-specific light chains to modify their activity. In the Drosophila testis, myosin VI is important for maintenance of moving actin structures, called actin cones, which mediate spermatid individualization. A CaM-related protein, Androcam (Acam), is abundantly expressed in the testis and like myosin VI, accumulates on these cones. We have investigated the possibility that Acam is a testis-specific light chain of Drosophila myosin VI. We find that Acam and myosin VI precisely colocalize at the leading edge of the actin cones and that myosin VI is necessary for this Acam localization. Further, myosin VI and Acam co-immunoprecipitate from the testis and interact in yeast two-hybrid assays. Finally Acam binds with high affinity to peptide versions of both myosin VI light chain binding sites. In contrast, although Drosophila CaM also shows high affinity interactions with these peptides, we cannot detect a CaM/myosin VI interaction in the testis. We conclude that Acam and not CaM acts as a myosin VI light chain in the Drosophila testis and hypothesize that it may alter the regulation of myosin VI in this tissue.",2006,"Kathryn G Miller, Rebecca A Simonette, Stephen R Martin, Kathleen M Beckingham, Peter M Bayley, Yung-Sheng R Lee, Bridget N T Gruender, Deborah J Frank"

As such, Paf1 is directly involved in transcription elongation via histone H2B ubiquitination and histone H3 methylation. The PD2 sequence is highly conserved from Drosophila to humans with up to 98% identity between rodent and human, suggesting the functional importance of PD2/hPaf1 to maintain cellular homeostasis. PD2 is a modular protein composed of RNA recognition motif, DEAD-boxes, an aspartic/serine (DS)-domain, a regulator of the chromosome condensation domain and myc-type helix-loop-helix domains.

In contradiction to this simple model, we show that dsx, as well as fruM and non-sex-specific retained (retn), affect both male and female sexual behaviors. In females, both retn and dsxF contribute to female receptivity, and both genes act to repress male-like courtship activity in the presence or absence of fruM. In males, consistent with the opposing functions of dsxM and dsxF, dsxM acts as a positive factor for male courtship. retn also acts counter to fruM in the development of the male-specific muscle of Lawrence.

After the shrimp were challenged with pathogenic bacteria via oral infection, the expression level of MjCAT was upregulated, and the enzyme activity was increased in the intestine. ROS level was also increased in the intestine at early time after oral infection and recovered rapidly.

Loss of a Clueless-dGRASP complex results in ER stress and blocks Integrin exit from the perinuclear endoplasmic reticulum in Drosophila larval muscle,25862246,10.1242/bio.201511551,"Drosophila Clueless (Clu) and its conserved orthologs are known for their role in the prevention of mitochondrial clustering. Here, we uncover a new role for Clu in the delivery of integrin subunits in muscle tissue. In clu mutants, αPS2 integrin, but not βPS integrin, abnormally accumulates in a perinuclear endoplasmic reticulum (ER) subdomain, a site that mirrors the endogenous localization of Clu. Loss of components essential for mitochondrial distribution do not phenocopy the clu mutant αPS2 phenotype. Conversely, RNAi knockdown of the Drosophila Golgi reassembly and stacking protein GRASP55/65 (dGRASP) recapitulates clu defects, including the abnormal accumulation of αPS2 and larval locomotor activity. Both Clu and dGRASP proteins physically interact and loss of Clu displaces dGRASP from ER exit sites, suggesting that Clu cooperates with dGRASP for the exit of αPS2 from a perinuclear subdomain in the ER. We also found that Clu and dGRASP loss of function leads to ER stress and that the stability of the ER exit site protein Sec16 is severely compromised in the clu mutants, thus explaining the ER accumulation of αPS2. Remarkably, exposure of clu RNAi larvae to chemical chaperones restores both αPS2 delivery and functional ER exit sites. We propose that Clu together with dGRASP prevents ER stress and therefore maintains Sec16 stability essential for the functional organization of perinuclear early secretory pathway. This, in turn, is essential for integrin subunit αPS2 ER exit in Drosophila larval myofibers.",2015,"Erika R Geisbrecht, Catherine Rabouille, Zong-Heng Wang"

We have characterized maheshvara (mahe), a novel gene in Drosophila melanogaster that encodes a putative DEAD box protein that is highly conserved across taxa and belongs to the largest group of RNA helicase. A dynamic pattern of mahe expression along with the maternal accumulation of its transcripts is seen during early stages of embryogenesis. In addition, a strong expression is also seen in the developing nervous system. Ectopic expression of mahe in a wide range of tissues during development results in a variety of defects, many of which resemble a typical Notch loss-of-function phenotype. We illustrate that ectopic expression of mahe in the wing imaginal discs leads to loss of Notch targets, Cut and Wingless. Interestingly, Notch protein levels are also lowered, whereas no obvious change is seen in the levels of Notch transcripts. In addition, mahe overexpression can significantly rescue ectopic Notch-mediated proliferation of eye tissue. Further, we illustrate that mahe genetically interacts with Notch and its cytoplasmic regulator deltex in trans-heterozygous combination. Coexpression of Deltex and Mahe at the dorso-ventral boundary results in a wing-nicking phenotype and a more pronounced loss of Notch target Cut. Taken together we report identification of a novel evolutionary conserved RNA helicase mahe, which plays a vital role in regulation of Notch signaling.",2015,"Ashim Mukherjee, Satya Surabhi, Pradeep K Bhaskar, Bhawana Maurya, Mousumi Mutsuddi, Bipin K Tripathi"
"A Circadian Clock Gene, Cry, Affects Heart Morphogenesis and Function in Drosophila as Revealed by Optical Coherence Microscopy",26348211,10.1371/journal.pone.0137236,"Circadian rhythms are endogenous, entrainable oscillations of physical, mental and behavioural processes in response to local environmental cues such as daylight, which are present in the living beings, including humans. Circadian rhythms have been related to cardiovascular function and pathology. However, the role that circadian clock genes play in heart development and function in a whole animal in vivo are poorly understood. The Drosophila cryptochrome (dCry) is a circadian clock gene that encodes a major component of the circadian clock negative feedback loop. Compared to the embryonic stage, the relative expression levels of dCry showed a significant increase (>100-fold) in Drosophila during the pupa and adult stages. In this study, we utilized an ultrahigh resolution optical coherence microscopy (OCM) system to perform non-invasive and longitudinal analysis of functional and morphological changes in the Drosophila heart throughout its post-embryonic lifecycle for the first time. The Drosophila heart exhibited major morphological and functional alterations during its development. Notably, heart rate (HR) and cardiac activity period (CAP) of Drosophila showed significant variations during the pupa stage, when heart remodeling took place. From the M-mode (2D + time) OCM images, cardiac structural and functional parameters of Drosophila at different developmental stages were quantitatively determined. In order to study the functional role of dCry on Drosophila heart development, we silenced dCry by RNAi in the Drosophila heart and mesoderm, and quantitatively measured heart morphology and function in those flies throughout its development. Silencing of dCry resulted in slower HR, reduced CAP, smaller heart chamber size, pupal lethality and disrupted posterior segmentation that was related to increased expression of a posterior compartment protein, wingless. Collectively, our studies provided novel evidence that the circadian clock gene, dCry, plays an essential role in heart morphogenesis and function.",2015,"Xianxu Zeng, Zhan Zhang, Diane E Capen, Rudolph E Tanzi, Mary L McKee, Aneesh Alex, Chao Zhou, Rebecca E Tate, Airong Li"
FAM150A and FAM150B are activating ligands for anaplastic lymphoma kinase,26418745,10.7554/eLife.09811,"Aberrant activation of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) has been described in a range of human cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer and neuroblastoma (Hallberg and Palmer, 2013). Vertebrate ALK has been considered to be an orphan receptor and the identity of the ALK ligand(s) is a critical issue. Here we show that FAM150A and FAM150B are potent ligands for human ALK that bind to the extracellular domain of ALK and in addition to activation of wild-type ALK are able to drive 'superactivation' of activated ALK mutants from neuroblastoma. In conclusion, our data show that ALK is robustly activated by the FAM150A/B ligands and provide an opportunity to develop ALK-targeted therapies in situations where ALK is overexpressed/activated or mutated in the context of the full length receptor.",2015,"Patricia Mendoza, Ruth H Palmer, Georg Wolfstetter, Amy W Hsu, Fredrik Hugosson, Kathrin Pfeifer, Hongbing Zhang, Yasuo Yamazaki, Bengt Hallberg, Ganesh Umapathy, Jikui Guan, Ateequrrahman Mohammed, Robert Halenbeck"
Estimating Orientation of Flying Fruit Flies,26173128,10.1371/journal.pone.0132101,"The recently growing interest in studying flight behaviours of fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster, has highlighted the need for developing tools that acquire quantitative motion data. Despite recent advance of video tracking systems, acquiring a flying fly's orientation remains a challenge for these tools. In this paper, we present a novel method for estimating individual flying fly's orientation using image cues. Thanks to the line reconstruction algorithm in computer vision field, this work can thereby focus on the practical detail of implementation and evaluation of the orientation estimation algorithm. The orientation estimation algorithm can be incorporated into tracking algorithms. We rigorously evaluated the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed algorithm by running experiments both on simulation data and on real-world data.

[Modelling of Drosophila gap gene network under Bcd morphogen variation],26016019,,"Expression patterns of segmentation genes are formed under the influence of maternal transcription factor gradients, which initiate spatially localized expression in the cascade of segmentation genes. Bcd is one of these activators. We have studied one model of regulation in the gap gene network by varying the concentration of this protein. We have shown that the known gap gene network topology is not sufficient to explain experimental data on the shifts exhibited by the hb anterior expression domain by change in Bcd concentration in the embryo. As the result of modeling with these experimental data taken into account, a new topology is obtained that determines the correct shifts of the hb expression domain. These results suggest that interactions among the three hb, Kr and gt genes are key regulatory factors for the valid behaviour of the hb expression pattern with Bcd concentration changes. This study made it possible to specify the limits of validity for phenomenological models of gene networks.",2015,"S A Andreev, V V Gursky, M G Samsonova"

The L. cuprina hsp60 gene/protein expression pattern was analyzed in various tissues, either at normal temperature (25±1°C) or after exposure to heat stress (42°C). The analysis of nucleotide sequence of Lchsp60 gene revealed absence of intron and the nuclear localizing signal (NLS). The deduced amino acid sequence showed presence of unique conserved sequences, such as those for mitochondrial localization, ATP binding, etc. Unlike Drosophila, Lucilia showed presence of only one isoform, i.e., hsp60A. Phylogenetic analysis of hsp60 gene homologues from different species revealed Lchsp60 to have >88.36% homology with D. melanogaster, 76.86% with L. sericata, 58.31% with mice, 57.99% with rat, and 57.72% with human.

Temporally distinct phosphorylations differentiate Tau-dependent learning deficits and premature mortality in Drosophila,25524708,10.1093/hmg/ddu726,"Abnormally phosphorylated Tau protein, the major component of neurofibrillary tangles, is critical in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and related Tauopathies. We used Drosophila to examine the role of key disease-associated phosphorylation sites on Tau-mediated neurotoxicity. We present evidence that the late-appearing phosphorylation on Ser(238) rather than hyperphosphorylation per se is essential for Tau toxicity underlying premature mortality in adult flies. This site is also occupied at the time of neurodegeneration onset in a mouse Tauopathy model and in damaged brain areas of confirmed Tauopathy patients, suggesting a similar critical role on Tau toxicity in humans. In contrast, occupation of Ser(262) is necessary for Tau-dependent learning deficits in adult Drosophila. Significantly, occupation of Ser(262) precedes and is required for Ser(238) phosphorylation, and these temporally distinct phosphorylations likely reflect conformational changes. Because sequential occupation of Ser(262) and Ser(238) is required for the progression from Tau-mediated learning deficits to premature mortality in Drosophila, they may also play similar roles in the escalating symptom severity in Tauopathy patients, congruent with their presence in damaged regions of their brains.",2015,"Efthimios M C Skoulakis, Katerina Papanikolopoulou"

Acknowledging selection at sub-organismal levels resolves controversy on pro-cooperation mechanisms,26714105,10.7554/eLife.10106,"Cooperators who pay a cost to produce publically-available benefits can be exploited by cheaters who do not contribute fairly. How might cooperation persist against cheaters? Two classes of mechanisms are known to promote cooperation: 'partner choice', where a cooperator preferentially interacts with cooperative over cheating partners; and 'partner fidelity feedback', where repeated interactions between individuals ensure that cheaters suffer as their cooperative partners languish (see, for example, Momeni et al., 2013). However when both mechanisms can act, differentiating them has generated controversy. Here, I resolve this controversy by noting that selection can operate on organismal and sub-organismal 'entities' such that partner fidelity feedback at sub-organismal level can appear as partner choice at organismal level. I also show that cooperation between multicellular eukaryotes and mitochondria is promoted by partner fidelity feedback and partner choice between sub-organismal entities, in addition to being promoted by partner fidelity feedback between hosts and symbionts, as was previously known.",2015,Wenying Shou
"A novel vertebrates Toll-like receptor counterpart regulating the anti-microbial peptides expression in the freshwater crayfish, Procambarus clarkii",25573502,10.1016/j.fsi.2014.12.038,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play an important role in regulation of anti-microbial peptides (AMPs) expression. A novel vertebrates TLR counterpart named PcToll, was firstly identified from the freshwater crayfish, Procambarus clarkii. Phylogenetic analysis showed that PcToll together with Drosophila melanogaster and Anopheles gambiae Toll9 were clustered with human Tolls. PcToll was mainly expressed in hepatopancreas and gills and it also could be detected in hemocytes, heart, stomach and intestine. PcToll was upregulated in hemocytes and gills post 24 h Vibrio anguillarum challenge. In hepatopancreas and intestine, the highest expression level of PcToll could be observed at 12 h V. anguillarum challenge. In hemocytes, PcToll went up post 24 h Staphylococcus aureus challenge and in gills, the expression level of PcToll showed no obvious change from 2 to 24 h S. aureus challenge. In hepatopancreas post 12 h S. aureus challenge, PcToll was upregulated and it showed obvious upregulation post 12 h S. aureus challenge in intestine. RNAi results showed that PcToll was involved in regulation of crustins (Cru1, Cru2), anti-lipopolysaccharide factor 2 (ALF2) and lysozyme 1 (Lys1) expression. Overexpression of PcToll in Drosophila S2 cells could induce Drosophila Attacin (Atta), Metchnikowin (Mtk), Drosomycin (Drs) and shrimp Penaeidin (PEN4) expression.

In the present study, we investigated the possible association of 13 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at these 10 loci with the prevalence of hypertension or their association with blood pressure (BP) in community-dwelling individuals in Japan. The study subjects comprised 6,027 individuals (2,250 subjects with essential hypertension, 3,777 controls) who were recruited into the Inabe Health and Longevity Study, a longitudinal genetic epidemiological study on atherosclerotic, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. The subjects were recruited from individuals who visited the Health Care Center of Inabe General Hospital for an annual health checkup, and they are followed up each year (mean follow‑up period, 5 years).

In this context, specificity relies on a versatile usage of conserved short linear motifs (SLiMs), which, surprisingly, often restrains the interaction potential of Hox proteins. This novel buffering activity of SLiMs was observed in different tissues and found in Hox proteins from cnidarian to mouse species. Although these interactions remain to be analysed in the context of endogenous Hox regulatory activities, our observations challenge the traditional role assigned to SLiMs and provide an alternative concept to explain how Hox interactome specificity could be achieved during the embryonic development.",2015,"Ana Rogulja-Ortmann, Amélie Dard, Marilyne Duffraisse, Bruno Hudry, Samir Merabet, Marjorie Heim, Manon Baëza, Séverine Viala, Christine Brun"

We recently demonstrated that mutant Huntingtin aggregates spread between cells within the Drosophila brain resulting in non-cell autonomous loss of a pair of large neurons in the posterior protocerebrum. However, the full extent of neuronal loss throughout the brain was not determined. Here we examine the effects of driving expression of mutant Huntingtin in Olfactory Receptor Neurons (ORNs) by using a marker for cleaved caspase activity to monitor neuronal apoptosis as a function of age. We find widespread caspase activity in various brain regions over time, demonstrating that non-cell autonomous damage is widespread.

Analysis of gene expression during aging of CGNs in culture: implication of SLIT2 and NPY in senescence,26047956,10.1007/s11357-015-9789-6,"Senescence is the major key factor that leads to the loss of neurons throughout aging. Cellular senescence is not the consequence of single cause, but there are multiple aspects which may induce senescence in a cell. Various causes such as gene expression, molecular interactions and protein processing and chromatin organization are described as causal factor for senescence. It is well known that the damage to the nuclear or mitochondrial DNA contributes to the aging either directly by inducing the apoptosis/cellular senescence or indirectly by altering cellular functions. The significant nuclear DNA damage with the age is directly associated with the continuous declining in DNA repair. The continuous decline in expression of topoisomerase 2 beta (Topo IIβ) in cultured cerebellar granule neurons over time indicated the decline in the repair of damage DNA. DNA Topo IIβ is an enzyme that is crucial for solving topological problems of DNA and thus has an important role in DNA repair. The enzyme is predominantly present in non-proliferating cells such as neurons. In this paper, we have studied the genes which were differentially expressed over time in cultured cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) and identified potential genes associated with the senescence. Our results showed that the two genes neuropeptide Y (Npy) and Slit homolog 2 (Drosophila) (Slit2) gradually increase during aging, and upon suppression of these two genes, there was gradual increase in cell viability along with restoration of the expression of Topo IIβ and potential repair proteins.",2015,"Anand K Kondapi, Pankaj Singh Dholaniya, Anil Chekuri, K Preeti Gupta"

This discovery, along with the link between rDNA, aging, and disease, high-lights the importance of understanding how natural rDNA copy number variation arises. Pursuing the relationship between rDNA expression and stability, we have discovered that increased dietary yeast concentration, emulating periods of dietary excess during life, results in somatic rDNA instability and copy number reduction. Modulation of Insulin/TOR signaling produces similar results, indicating a role for known nutrient sensing signaling pathways in this process. Furthermore, adults fed elevated dietary yeast concentrations produce offspring with fewer rDNA copies demonstrating that these effects also occur in the germline, and are transgenerationally heritable.

Parental age influences developmental stability of the progeny in Drosophila,25673675,10.1098/rspb.2014.2437,"The stochastic nature of biochemical processes is a source of variability that influences developmental stability. Developmental instability (DI) is often estimated through fluctuating asymmetry (FA), a parameter that deals with within-individual variation in bilateral structures. A relevant goal is to shed light on how environment, physiology and genotype relate to DI, thus providing a more comprehensive view of organismal development. Using Drosophila melanogaster isogenic lines, we investigated the effect of parental age, parental diet and offspring heterozygosity on DI. In this work, we have uncovered a clear relationship between parental age and offspring asymmetry. We show that asymmetry of the progeny increases concomitantly with parental age. Moreover, we demonstrate that enriching the diet of parents mitigates the effect of age on offspring symmetry. We show as well that increasing the heterozygosity of the progeny eliminates the effect of parental age on offspring symmetry. Taken together, our results suggest that diet, genotype and age of the parents interact to determine offspring DI in wild populations. These findings provide us with an avenue to understand the mechanisms underlying DI.",2015,"Betina Colines, Esteban R Hasson, Nicolás Frankel, Nahuel Cabrera Rodríguez, Valeria Carreira"
Bouvardin is a Radiation Modulator with a Novel Mechanism of Action,26414509,10.1667/RR14068.1,"Protein synthesis is essential for growth, proliferation and survival of cells. Translation factors are overexpressed in many cancers and in preclinical models, their experimental inhibition has been shown to inhibit cancer growth. Differential regulation of translation also occurs upon exposure to cancer-relevant stressors such as hypoxia and ionizing radiation. The failure to regulate translation has been shown to interfere with recovery after genotoxic stress. These findings suggest that modulation of translation, alone or in conjunction with genotoxins, may be therapeutic in oncology. Yet, only two drugs that directly inhibit translation are FDA-approved for oncology therapies used today. We have previously identified the protein synthesis inhibitor, bouvardin in a screen for small molecule enhancers of ionizing radiation in Drosophila melanogaster . Bouvardin was independently identified in a screen for selective inhibitors of engineered human breast cancer stem cells. Here we report the effect of bouvardin treatment in preclinical models of head and neck cancer (HNC) and glioma, two cancer types for which radiation therapy is the most common treatment. Our data show that bouvardin treatment blocked translation elongation on human ribosomes and suggest that it did so by blocking the dissociation of elongation factor 2 from the ribosome. Bouvardin and radiation enhanced the induction of clonogenic death in HNC and glioma cells, although by different mechanisms.

Fatiguing exercise initiated later in life reduces incidence of fibrillation and improves sleep quality in Drosophila,26206392,10.1007/s11357-015-9816-7,"As the human body ages, the risk of heart disease and stroke greatly increases. While there is evidence that lifelong exercise is beneficial to the heart's health, the effects of beginning exercise later in life remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate whether exercise training started later in life is beneficial to cardiac aging in Drosophila. We examined 4-week-old wild-type virgin female flies that were exposed to exercise periods of either 1.5, 2.0, or 2.5 h per day, 5 days a week for 2 weeks. Using M-mode traces to analyze cardiac function by looking at parameters including heart rate, rhythmicity, systolic and diastolic diameter, and interval and fractional shortening, we found that cardiac function declined with age, shown by an increase in the number of fibrillation events and a decrease in fractional shortening. About 2.0 and 2.5 h of exercise per day displayed a reduced incidence of fibrillation events, and only physical exercise lasting 2.5-h period increased fractional shortening and total sleep time in Drosophila. These data suggested that training exercise needs to be performed for longer duration to exert physiological benefits for the aging heart. Additionally, climbing ability to assess the exercise-induced muscle fatigue was also measured. We found that 2.0 and 2.5 h of exercise caused exercise-induced fatigue, and fatiguing exercise is beneficial for cardiac and healthy aging overall.

"Integrated 3D view of postmating responses by the Drosophila melanogaster female reproductive tract, obtained by micro-computed tomography scanning",26041806,10.1073/pnas.1505797112,"Physiological changes in females during and after mating are triggered by seminal fluid components in conjunction with female-derived molecules. In insects, these changes include increased egg production, storage of sperm, and changes in muscle contraction within the reproductive tract (RT). Such postmating changes have been studied in dissected RT tissues, but understanding their coordination in vivo requires a holistic view of the tissues and their interrelationships. Here, we used high-resolution, multiscale micro-computed tomography (CT) scans to visualize and measure postmating changes in situ in the Drosophila female RT before, during, and after mating. These studies reveal previously unidentified dynamic changes in the conformation of the female RT that occur after mating. Our results also reveal how the reproductive organs temporally shift in concert within the confines of the abdomen. For example, we observed chiral loops in the uterus and in the upper common oviduct that relax and constrict throughout sperm storage and egg movement. We found that specific seminal fluid proteins or female secretions mediate some of the postmating changes in morphology. The morphological movements, in turn, can cause further changes due to the connections among organs. In addition, we observed apparent copulatory damage to the female intima, suggesting a mechanism for entry of seminal proteins, or other exogenous components, into the female's circulatory system. The 3D reconstructions provided by high-resolution micro-CT scans reveal how male and female molecules and anatomy interface to carry out and coordinate mating-dependent changes in the female's reproductive physiology.",2015,"Frank W Avila, Mark L Riccio, Alexandra L Mattei, Mariana F Wolfner"
"Mapping a mutator, mu2, which increases the frequency of terminal deletions in Drosophila melanogaster",7808410,10.1007/BF00282222,"A mutator, mu2, in Drosophila melanogaster has been identified recently that potentiates the recovery of terminal deficiencies.

These deficiencies identify the map position of mu2 as 62B11-C1. A yeast artificial chromosome spanning this region has been subcloned into lambda phage, and the positions of deficiency breakpoints on either side of the mu2 gene have been identified within the subclones.

The mago nashi locus encodes an essential product required for germ plasm assembly in Drosophila,8026338,,"In Drosophila, the localization of maternal determinants to the posterior pole of the oocyte is required for abdominal segmentation and germ cell formation. These processes are disrupted by maternal effect mutations in ten genes that constitute the posterior group. Here, the molecular analysis of one posterior group gene, mago nashi, is presented. Restriction fragment length polymorphisms and transcript alterations associated with mago nashi mutations were used to identify the mago nashi locus within a chromosomal walk. The mago nashi locus was sequenced and found to encode a 147 amino acid protein with no similarity to proteins of known or suspected function. The identification of the mago nashi locus was confirmed by sequencing mutant alleles and by P element-mediated transformation. Nonsense mutations in mago nashi, as well as a deletion of the 5' coding sequences, result in zygotic lethality. The original mago nashi allele disrupts the localization of oskar mRNA and staufen protein to the posterior pole of the oocyte during oogenesis; anterior localization of bicoid mRNA is unaffected by the mutation. These results demonstrate that mago nashi encodes an essential product necessary for the localization of germ plasm components to the posterior pole of the oocyte.",1994,"R E Boswell, P A Newmark"
"[Variability of rDNA genes, detected as a result of analyzing a pseudogene nucleotide sequence in Drosophila melanogaster]",8188052,,"A pseudogene bearing the bulk of the 18S RNA gene was detected outside the rDNA cluster. It comprised irregularly distributed nucleotide substitutions as well as short insertions and deletions. No sequence alterations were observed in the 5' region of the pseudogene, whereas the frequency of substitutions and alterations per nucleotide number in the 3' region and in the middle of the sequence was 7.6% and 1.8%, respectively. The observed sharp irregularity in distribution of substitutions and alterations was considered the result of successive recombinations between the functional 18S rRNA gene and its diverged or damaged variants. This phenomenon provides experimental evidence that recombinations between the pseudogene and functioning repeats of rDNA are implicated in the mechanism of rDNA sequence correction. A segment of the pseudogene sequence was shown to contain substitutions primarily in regions coding for single-strand parts of the RNA molecule. The same segment contained a deletion and an insertion of a nucleotide, approximating it to the most of the studied eukaryotic 18S rRNA sequences. These observations allowed us to supposed that a structural rDNA variant, a fragment of which appears in the pseudogene sequence, is present in the genome. The data obtained suggest both the presence of 18S rDNA variants, and recombination between them, determining the concerted evolution of rRNA genes.",1994,"V A Gvozdev, I P Arman, G L Kogan, E V Benevolenskaia, M D Balakireva, D Filipp"
Behavioural correlates of selection for oviposition by Drosophila melanogaster females in a patchy environment,8077111,10.1038/hdy.1994.105,"The behaviour of females from lines selected for high (H) and low (L) aggregated oviposition was compared in an environment consisting of discrete patches of resource available for larval development. Oviposition behaviour was influenced by the conformation and by the texture of the substrate, but this does not account for the selective differences in levels of aggregation which are under genetic control. The distribution of males of both selected populations tends to be overdispersed across resource patches. This observation is consistent with male territorial behaviour. The dispersal patterns of females of the two selected populations differ significantly. H females show a contagious distribution whereas the distribution for L females is more nearly random. Differences in adult female dispersion are likely to be a significant factor contributing to aggregated oviposition. The level of aggregated oviposition affects the pattern of progeny survival when the unit of resource in each patch is small.",1994,"K Connolly, B Burnet, G Ruiz-Dubreuil"
Translational repression as a conserved mechanism for the regulation of embryonic polarity,7980473,10.1002/bies.950161003,"The mechanisms used to establish embryonic polarity are still largely unknown. A recent paper(1) describes the expression pattern of the gene glp-1, which is required for induction events during development of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Although glp-1 RNA is found throughout the early embryo, Glp-1 protein is only expressed in anterior cells. This negative translational regulation in posterior cells is shown to be mediated through sequences in the glp-1 3'untranslated region (3'UTR). Thus in nematodes, as in Drosophila, translational repression is one mechanism used to establish the embryonic anterior-posterior axis.",1994,D Curtis
"Misexpression of the Drosophila argos gene, a secreted regulator of cell determination",7925030,,"I have examined the effects on cells in the developing eye of over-expressing the argos gene. Transgenic flies carrying argos expressed under hsp70 and sevenless control sequences were analysed. All cell types in the developing eye (except bristles) are sensitive to argos concentration: over-expression leads to too few cells forming, the opposite phenotype to that seen in argos loss-of-function mutants. This effect was only seen with HS-argos flies: sev-argos flies, which over-express the protein at a lower level are not affected, suggesting that a considerable over-expression is required to disrupt cell fate. However, sev-argos is able to rescue argos eye mutations completely, indicating that the normal expression pattern is not critical for wild-type eye development. By transfecting argos into tissue culture cells, I show that the protein is secreted in a soluble form.",1994,M Freeman

Expression of the polyhomeotic locus in development of Drosophila melanogaster,28305949,10.1007/BF00188692,"The polyhomeotic (ph) gene of Drosophila melanogaster encodes a chromatin protein required for negative regulation of homeotic genes, and is a member of the Polycomb group of genes. The distribution of ph mRNA and protein was determined in embryos, imaginal discs, and ovaries. Distribution of ph protein and mRNA coincided, except in early embryogogenesis. During blastoderm, ph mRNA is present in anterior and posterior domains that are themselves subdivided into stripes. During germ band extension, a segmentally repeated striped pattern of mRNA expression is seen. ph protein is first detected as a nuclear protein during cell cycle 10, and is ubiquitously expressed. ph protein stains more heavily in the ectodermal mitotic domains described by Foe (1989). Later, ph mRNA and protein expression is concentrated in the neuronal cell bodies of the central nervous system, and can also be detected in the peripheral nervous system. In imaginal discs, ph expression is non-uniform in metathoracic discs, but appears more regular in other imaginal discs. The ph mRNA is found in the germarium and in stages 1-10 in nurse cells and follicle cells, but we do not detect it in oocytes.

USING HITCHHIKING GENES TO STUDY ADAPTATION AND DIVERGENCE DURING SPECIATION WITHIN THE DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER SPECIES COMPLEX,28565154,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1994.tb02222.x,"Several studies of intraspecific and interspecific DNA sequence variation from Drosophila loci have revealed a pattern of low intraspecific variation from genomic regions of low recombination. The mechanisms consistently invoked to explain these patterns are the selective sweep of advantageous mutations together with genetic hitchhiking of linked loci. To examine the effect of selective sweeps on genetic divergence during speciation, we studied two loci in different genomic regions thought to be subject to selective sweeps. We obtained DNA sequences from 1.1kb pair portions of the fourth chromosome locus cubitus interruptus Dominant (ciD ) and from the asense locus near the telomere of the X chromosome. At ciD , we found very low variation among multiple lines of Drosophila mauritiana and D. sechellia. This finding is consistent with an earlier report of very low variation in D. melanogaster and D. simulans at ciD and supports the conclusion of selective sweeps and genetic hitchhiking on the nonrecombining fourth chromosome. The pattern of variation found at asense suggests that a selective sweep has occurred recently at the tip of the X chromosome in D. simulans, but not in D. melanogaster or D. mauritiana. The data from ciD and asense are compared with data from three X chromosome loci (period, zeste, and yolk protein 2) that experience normal levels of recombination. By examining estimated genealogies and the rates at which different classes of mutations have accumulated, we conclude that selective sweeps are common occurrences on the fourth chromosome but less common near the tip of the X chromosome. An interesting pattern of low variation at ciD among D. simulans, D. mauritiana, and D. sechellia suggests that a selective sweep may have occurred among these forms even after divergence into separate species had begun.",1994,"Jody Hey, Richard M Kliman, Holly Hilton"
I factors in Drosophila melanogaster: transposition under control,7813907,10.1007/BF01435243,"I factors are responsible for the I-R system of hybrid dysgenesis in Drosophila melanogaster. They belong to the LINE class of mobile elements, which transpose via reverse transcription of a full-length RNA intermediate. I factors are active members of the I element family, which also contains defective I elements that are immobilized within peri-centromeric heterochromatin and represent very old components of the genome. Active I factors have recently invaded natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster, giving rise to inducer strains. Reactive strains, devoid of active I factors, derive from old laboratory stocks established before the invasion. Transposition of I factors is activated at very high frequencies in the germline of hybrid females issued from crosses between females from reactive strains and males from inducer strains. It results in the production of high rates of mutations and chromosomal rearrangements as well as in a particular syndrome of sterility. The frequency of transposition of I factors is dependent on the amount of full-length RNA that is synthesized from an internal promoter. This full-length RNA serves both as an intermediate of transposition and presumably as a messenger for protein synthesis. Regulators of transposition apparently affect transcription initiation from the internal promoter. The data presented here lead to the proposal of a tentative model for transposition.",1994,"A Pélisson, I Busseau, A Bucheton, M C Chaboissier"
Transcription of repetitive DNA sequences in the lampbrush loop pair Nooses formed by sterile alleles of fertility gene Q on the Y chromosome of Drosophila hydei,7969035,10.1007/BF00282756,"The Y chromosomal lampbrush loop-forming male fertility genes of Drosophila consist mainly of repetitive DNA sequences that do not code for proteins. We investigated whether differences in the transcription of these sequences can be detected in male-sterile alleles of male fertility gene Q, which forms the loop pair Nooses. The loop consists, for approximately two-thirds, of repeats of the Y-specific ay1 family of repetitive DNA sequences. Of the remaining one-third, at least one-half is represented by defective retrotransposons of the gypsy family. Both sequence types are interspersed throughout the loop. Using both ay1 and gypsy sequences as probes for transcript in situ hybridization, we show that, at the level of the light microscope, transcription of neither sequence is detectably affected in the loops formed by a male-sterile allele of gene Q. We conclude that the transcription of ay1 and gypsy is required, but not sufficient for the function of gene Q.",1994,"W Hennig, R Brand, R Hochstenbach"

When the Con A- and antibody-Sepharose bound fractions were examined, four glycoproteins with carbohydrate antigens recognized by anti-HRP antiserum were identified in all the tissue.

Sequence-specific DNA binding of individual cut repeats of the human CCAAT displacement/cut homeodomain protein,7914370,10.1073/pnas.91.16.7757,"CCAAT displacement protein (CDP), a nuclear protein of 180-190 kDa, contains a triplicated motif, the cut domain, similar (80-90% conserved) to three repeats of 60-65 amino acids first identified in Drosophila cut, a homeo-domain protein involved in cell-fate decisions in development. Cut repeats bind DNA and exhibit subtle differences in target-site recognition. DNA sequences specifically bound by cut repeats were isolated by PCR-mediated DNA target-site selection. Sequences selected for cut repeat 2 and 3 (CR2 and CR3) binding are A+T-rich and favor an ATA motif with similar, but not identical, flanking base preferences. CR2 and CR3 discriminate among similar target sequences. CR1, which is more divergent from CR2 and CR3, displays the most restricted pattern of DNA sequence recognition. Methylation interference analysis demonstrates different protein-DNA contacts for CR1 and CR3 binding to a target sequence. Thus, CDP/cut is a complex protein whose DNA-binding properties reflect the combinatorial interaction of four domains (three cut repeats and one homeodomain) with target DNA sequences.",1994,"E J Neufeld, S H Orkin, B Aufiero"

The gene codes for a component of cuticlin, the insoluble residue of nematode cuticles. Conceptual translation of cut-2 reveals a 231-amino acid secreted protein which, like CUT-1, begins with a putative signal peptide of 16 residues. The central part of the protein consists of 13 repetitions of a short hydrophobic motif, which is often degenerated with substitutions and deletions. Parts of this motif are present also in CUT-1 (Caenorhabditis elegans) as well as in several protein components of the larval cuticle and of the eggshell layers of various insects (Locusta migratoria, Ceratitis capitata and Drosophila species). These sequence similarities are related to the similar functions of these proteins: they are all components of extracellular insoluble protective layers. Immunolocalisation and transcription analysis suggest that CUT-2 contributes to the cuticles of all larval stages and that it is not stage-specific. Analysis by reverse transcriptase-PCR suggests that it is not stage-specific. Analysis by reverse transcriptase-PCR suggests that transcription is not continuous throughout larval development but occurs in peaks which precede the moults. Dityrosine has been detected in the cuticle of nematodes and of insects; formation of dityrosine bridges may be one of the cross-linking mechanisms contributing to the insolubility of cuticlins. Recombinant, soluble CUT-2 is shown to be an excellent substrate for an in vitro cross-linking reaction, catalysed by horseradish peroxidase in the presence of H2O2, which results in the formation of insoluble, high-molecular weight CUT-2 and of dityrosine.",1994,"P Bazzicalupo, F Lassandro, M Sebastiano, F Zei"

The molecular and population genetics of cyclodiene insecticide resistance,8025556,10.1016/0965-1748(94)90026-4,"Cyclodiene resistance has accounted for over 60% of reported cases of insecticide resistance. Understanding of this resistance can therefore help us answer questions relating to the mechanism and origin of representative resistance-associated mutations, questions fundamental to the molecular and populations genetics of pesticide resistance. The cyclodiene resistance gene Rdl (resistance to dieldrin) was cloned from a mutant of the model insect Drosophila resistant to cyclodienes and picrotoxinin. Rdl codes for a subunit of a novel class of GABA gated chloride ion channels and resistance is correlated with replacement of the same amino acid residue in a wide range of species from different insect orders. This single amino acid replacement Ala302 > Ser, within the proposed lining of the chloride ion channel, also confers insensitivity to the blocking action of cyclodienes and picrotoxinin on GABA gated chloride ion channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes. The resistance mechanism involves both changes in cyclodiene binding site affinity and also a change in the rate of receptor desensitization which destabilizes the cyclodiene-favored conformation. Documentation of the resistance associated mutation has allowed for the design of a PCR based molecular monitoring technique. This technique gives more accurate estimates of resistance gene frequency from smaller sample sizes and has shown the frequency of resistance in apparently unselected populations of Drosophila to be as high as 1%. We are still uncertain as to why resistance persists in the apparent absence of selection pressure and any severe reduction in the fitness of resistant strains, besides a paralytic phenotype at high temperature, remains undocumented.",1994,R H Ffrench-Constant

"Prediction and verification of microRNA targets by MovingTargets, a highly adaptable prediction method",15943864,10.1186/1471-2164-6-88,"Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) mediate a form of translational regulation in animals. Hundreds of animal miRNAs have been identified, but only a few of their targets are known. Prediction of miRNA targets for translational regulation is challenging, since the interaction with the target mRNA usually occurs via incomplete and interrupted base pairing. Moreover, the rules that govern such interactions are incompletely defined. Results: MovingTargets is a software program that allows a researcher to predict a set of miRNA targets that satisfy an adjustable set of biological constraints. We used MovingTargets to identify a high-likelihood set of 83 miRNA targets in Drosophila, all of which adhere to strict biological constraints. We tested and verified 3 of these predictions in cultured cells, including a target for the Drosophila let-7 homolog. In addition, we utilized the flexibility of MovingTargets by relaxing the biological constraints to identify and validate miRNAs targeting tramtrack, a gene also known to be subject to translational control dependent on the RNA binding protein Musashi. Conclusion: MovingTargets is a flexible tool for the accurate prediction of miRNA targets in Drosophila. MovingTargets can be used to conduct a genome-wide search of miRNA targets using all Drosophila miRNAs and potential targets, or it can be used to conduct a focused search for miRNAs targeting a specific gene. In addition, the values for a set of biological constraints used to define a miRNA target are adjustable, allowing the software to incorporate the rules used to characterize a miRNA target as these rules are experimentally determined and interpreted.",2005,"Craig Burgler, Paul M Macdonald"

Because SNAI family proteins are implicated in EMT during embryogenesis and carcinogenesis, SNAI family genes are potent targets of pharmacogenomics. Here, comparative genomics analyses and comparative proteomics analyses on SNAI family orthologs were performed. Rat Snai3 gene, consisting of three exons, was identified within rat genome sequence AC111791.4. Zebrafish snai1a (NM_131066.1) was identified as SNAI1 ortholog. Chicken ChEST362l17 (CR407272.1), Xenopus slug (AF368041.1), and zebrafish zgc92564 (NM_001008581.1) were identified as SNAI2 orthologs. Chicken snail (NM_ 205142.1), Xenopus snail (BC056857.1), and zebrafish snai1b (NM_130989.1) were identified as SNAI3 orthologs.

As in mammals, arousal thresholds in flies increase with sleep deprivation. Furthermore, changes in brain electrical activity accompany the change from wake to sleep states. Not only do flies and vertebrates share these behavioral and physiological traits of sleep, but they are likely to share at least some genetic mechanisms underlying the regulation of sleep as well.

Characterization of a cloned temperature-sensitive construct of the diphtheria toxin A domain,15709768,10.1021/bi048317p,"Our goal was to determine how the DTM mutant construct of the A domain of diphtheria toxin (DTx) causes temperature-sensitive effects in Drosophila and yeast [Bellen, H. J., D'Evelyn, D., Harvey, M., Elledge, S. J. (1992) Development 114, 787-796]. Because DTM fortuitously bears the same point mutation as found in the A chain of CRM197, an ADP-ribosyltransferase (ADPrT)-deficient form of DTx, we hypothesized that the dramatic low-temperature-sensitive effects did not stem from ADP-ribosylation of elongation factor 2 (EF-2). To rule out acquisition of ADPrT activity at low temperatures, we assayed mutant forms of the A domain of DTx produced by in vitro transcription/translation and found that DTM has no ability to ADP-ribosylate EF-2 at 18 or 30 degrees C. Because the DTM gene results in a protein with a 23-amino acid missense carboxy-terminal extension, we also constructed a form without this extension. Assays for nuclease activity revealed that nuclease activity comigrated with the two distinguishable E. coli-cloned mutant proteins DTM and DTM-23, regardless of whether electrophoresis was conducted under denaturing or nondenaturing conditions in gels embedded with DNA. Studies with CRM197 showed that Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) promote single-strand DNA nicks, whereas Mn(2+) promotes double-strand DNA breaks. Evidence that the cation-dependent nuclease and NAD-dependent ADPrT enzymic sites are distinct is that NAD protected only the A domain of DTx from proteolytic cleavage, whereas DNA protected the A domains of both DTx and CRM197.

The strong conservation of innate immunity systems in organisms from Drosophila to mammals, and the ease with which Drosophila can be manipulated genetically, makes this fly a good model system for investigating the mechanisms of virulence of a number of medically important pathogens. Potentially damaging endogenous and/or exogenous challenges sensed by specific receptors initiate signals via the Toll and/or Imd signaling pathways. These in turn activate the transcription factors Dorsal, Dorsal-related immune factor (Dif) and Relish, culminating in transcription of genes involved in the production of antimicrobial peptides, melanization, phagocytosis, and the cytoskeletal rearrangement required for appropriate responses.

Here we show that codon bias and recombination rate are correlated strongly and negatively on the X chromosome, and that this correlation cannot be explained by indirect relationships with other known determinants of codon bias. This is in dramatic contrast to the weak positive correlation found on the autosomes.

Miscoordination of the communicative signals will lead to disasters like cancer and other fatal diseases. The JAK/STAT signal transduction pathway is one of the pathways, which was first identified in vertebrates and is highly conserved throughout evolution. Studying the JAK/STAT signal transduction pathway in Drosophila provides an excellent opportunity to understand the molecular mechanism of the cell regulation during development and tumor formation.

Genetic regions that interact with loss- and gain-of-function phenotypes of deltex implicate novel genes in Drosophila Notch signaling,15650868,10.1007/s00438-004-1098-1,"The Notch signaling pathway is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that regulates many cell fate decisions. The deltex (dx) gene encodes an E3-ubiquitin ligase that binds to the intracellular domain of the Notch protein and regulates Notch signaling in a positive manner. However, it is still not clear how Dx does this. We generated a transgenic line, GMR-dx, which overexpresses dx in the developing Drosophila eye disc. The GMR-dx line showed a rough-eye phenotype, specific transformation of a photoreceptor cell (R3 to R4), and a rotation defect in the ommatidia. This phenotype was suppressed in combination with a dx loss-of-function mutant, indicating that it was due to a dx gain-of-function. We previously reported that overexpression of Dx results in the stabilization of Notch in late endosomes. Here, we found that three motifs in Dx, a region that binds to Notch, a proline-rich motif and a RING-H2 finger, were required for this stabilization, although the relative activity of these variants in this assay did not always correspond to the severity of the rough-eye phenotype. In an attempt to identify novel genes of the Notch pathway, we tested a large collection of chromosomal deficiencies for the ability to modify the eye phenotypes of the GMR-dx line. Twelve genomic segments that enhanced the rough-eye phenotype of GMR-dx were identified. To evaluate the specificity of these interactions, we then determined whether the deletions also interacted with the wing phenotypes associated with a loss-of-function mutation of dx, dx24. Analyses based on whole-genome information allowed us to conclude that we have identified two novel loci that probably include uncharacterized genes involved in Dx-mediated Notch signaling.",2005,"Kazuya Hori, Tatsunori Seki, Kenji Matsuno, Takashi J Fuwa"
One neuron--multiple receptors: increased complexity in olfactory coding?,15914726,10.1126/stke.2852005pe25,"Olfaction--the sense of smell--is responsible for detecting molecules of immense structural variety. Precise recognition of such diverse stimuli requires a massive receptor repertoire. This functional challenge has been met by simultaneous expression of a multitude of odor-detecting receptors that all belong to the superfamily of heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein (G protein)-coupled receptors. Studies conducted over the past decade have led to the assumption that an individual olfactory sensory neuron expresses only a single odorant receptor, consequently giving rise to the ""one receptor-one neuron"" hypothesis. This idea is attractive because of its simplicity and has served as the basis for models of olfactory coding. However, recent reports regarding Drosophila have found exceptions to the rule that could have important implications for the logic of olfactory coding.",2005,"Trese Leinders-Zufall, Marc Spehr"
Expression and function of Toll-like receptor on T cells,15950961,10.1016/j.cellimm.2005.04.019,"Toll is the founder of a group of pattern recognition receptors, which play a critical role in the innate immunity in Drosophila. At least 13 distinct Toll-like receptors (TLRs), recognising pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMPs), have now been identified in humans. Most investigations on TLRs have focused on cells of the innate system. We report here that naïve human T cells expressed high levels of cell surface TLR2 after activation by anti-T cell receptor (TCR) antibody and interferon-alpha. Activated cells produced elevated levels of cytokines in response to the TLR2 ligand, bacterial lipopeptide (BLP). Furthermore, CD4(+)CD45RO(+) memory T cells from peripheral blood constitutively expressed TLR2 and produced IFNgamma in response to BLP. BLP also markedly enhanced the proliferation and IFNgamma production by CD45RO(+) T cells in the presence of IL-2 or IL-15. Thus, TLR2 serves as a co-stimulatory receptor for antigen-specific T cell development and participates in the maintenance of T cell memory. This suggests that pathogens, via their PAMPs, may contribute directly to the perpetuation and activation of long term T cell memory in both antigen dependent and independent manner.",2005,"Damo Xu, Mousa Komai-Koma, Foo Y Liew"
Genetic coadaptation of the amylase gene system in Drosophila melanogaster: evidence for the selective advantage of the lowest AMY activity and of its epistatic genetic background,15800131,10.1093/jhered/esi051,"In natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster, an amylase isozyme with the lowest alpha-amylase activity (AMY(1,1)) is predominant. To evaluate the selective significance of AMY(1,1) and its regulatory factor(s), we examined selection experiments in laboratory populations on two distinct food environments. After 300 generations, AMY(1,1) became predominant (89%) in a glucose (a product of AMY)-rich environment, while an isozyme with higher alpha-amylase activity, AMY(1,6), became predominant (83%) in a starch (substrate)-rich environment. We found that the identical alleles of the amylase (Amy) gene, which encodes each of AMY(1,1) and AMY(1,6), were shared between the two populations in the different food environments, employing the nucleotide sequencing of the duplicated Amy genes. Nevertheless, AMY(1,6) homozygotes selected in the starch-rich environment had a twofold higher AMY enzyme activity than those selected in the glucose-rich environment, suggesting a coadaptation of the coding region and its regulatory factor(s) on the genetic background. Such a difference in AMY enzyme activity was not detected between AMY(1,1) homozygotes, suggesting that the effect of the genetic background is epistatic. Our results indicate that natural selection is working on the Amy gene system as a whole for flies to adapt to the various food environments of local populations.",2005,"T Yamazaki, S Yoshizumi, H Araki, N Inomata"
Disruption of synaptic development and ultrastructure by Drosophila NSF2 alleles,15912502,10.1002/cne.20603,"First identified as the cytosolic component that restored intra-Golgi vesicle trafficking following N-ethylmaleimide poisoning, N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) was later shown to be an ATPase that participates in many vesicular trafficking events. Current models hold that NSF disassembles postfusion SNARE protein complexes, allowing them to participate in further rounds of vesicle cycling. To further understand the role of NSF in neural function, we have embarked on genetic studies of Drosophila NSF2. In one approach, we employed transgenic flies that carry a dominant-negative form of NSF2 (NSF(E/Q)). When expressed in neurons this construct suppresses synaptic transmission, increases activity-dependent fatigue of transmitter release, and reduces the functional size of the pool of vesicles available for release. Unexpectedly, it also induced pronounced overgrowth of the neuromuscular junction. The aim of the present study was twofold. First, we sought to determine if the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) overgrowth phenotype is present throughout development. Second, we examined NSF2(E/Q) larval synapses by serial section electron microscopy in order to determine if there are ultrastructural correlates to the observed physiological and morphological phenotypes. We indeed found that the NMJ overgrowth phenotype is present at the embryonic neuromuscular synapse. Likewise, at the ultrastructural level, we found considerable alterations in the number and distribution of synapses and active zones, whereas the number of vesicles present was not changed. From these data we conclude that a primary phenotype of the NSF2(E/Q) transgene is a developmental one and that alteration in the number and distribution of active zones contributes to the NSF2(E/Q) physiological phenotype.",2005,"Bryan A Stewart, Joanne Pearce, Martha Bajec, Radhika Khorana"
Histone acetylation regulates both transcription initiation and elongation of hsp22 gene in Drosophila,15607742,10.1016/j.bbrc.2004.11.118,"Histone acetylation is associated with transcriptional activation of many genes. However, the role of acetylation in transcriptional regulation of heat shock protein genes (hsp) still remains an obscure issue. Here we examined the effects of histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDIs), trichostatin A, and sodium butyrate, on changes in acetylation level of core histones and on expression of hsp22 gene in Drosophila melanogaster. The results showed that both HDIs elevated the acetylation level of histone H3. By using the chromatin immunoprecipitation, we located the HDI-induced H3 hyperacetylation at both the promoter and the downstream of RNA polymerase II of the transcribing hsp22 gene. Meanwhile, the elevated acetylation level increased the accessibility of heat shock factor to target cis-acting regulatory sites. We conclude that histone acetylation stimulates the transcription initiation and promotes the transcription elongation, thereby up-regulating both basal and inducible expression of hsp22 in D. melanogaster.",2005,"Baiqu Huang, Xia Chen, Hui Sun, Yanmei Zhao, Dan Tao, Weifeng Huang, Jun Lu"
Dopaminergic modulation of arousal in Drosophila,16005288,10.1016/j.cub.2005.05.025,"Background: Arousal levels in the brain set thresholds for behavior, from simple to complex. The mechanistic underpinnings of the various phenomena comprising arousal, however, are still poorly understood. Drosophila behaviors have been studied that span different levels of arousal, from sleep to visual perception to psychostimulant responses. Results: We have investigated neurobiological mechanisms of arousal in the Drosophila brain by a combined behavioral, genetic, pharmacological, and electrophysiological approach. Administration of methamphetamine (METH) suppresses sleep and promotes active wakefulness, whereas an inhibitor of dopamine synthesis promotes sleep. METH affects courtship behavior by increasing sexual arousal while decreasing successful sexual performance. Electrophysiological recordings from the medial protocerebrum of wild-type flies showed that METH ingestion has rapid and detrimental effects on a brain response associated with perception of visual stimuli. Recordings in genetically manipulated animals show that dopaminergic transmission is required for these responses and that visual-processing deficits caused by attenuated dopaminergic transmission can be rescued by METH. Conclusions: We show that changes in dopamine levels differentially affect arousal for behaviors of varying complexity. Complex behaviors, such as visual perception, degenerate when dopamine levels are either too high or too low, in accordance with the inverted-U hypothesis of dopamine action in the mammalian brain. Simpler behaviors, such as sleep and locomotion, show graded responses that follow changes in dopamine level.",2005,"Ralph J Greenspan, Rozi Andretic, Bruno van Swinderen"

Screening a cDNA library prepared from silk-producing glands of the black widow spider, we have identified a new bHLH transcription factor named SGSF. Within the bHLH region, SGSF showed considerable conservation with other HLH proteins, including Drosophila melanogaster achaete and scute, as well as three HLH proteins identified by gene prediction programs. The expression pattern of SGSF was restricted to a subset of silk-producing glands, which include the tubuliform and major ampullate glands. SGSF was capable of binding an E-box element as a heterodimer with the E protein, E47, but was unable to bind this motif as a homodimer. SGSF was demonstrated to be a nuclear transcription factor capable of attenuating the transactivation of E47 homodimers in mammalian cells. SGSF represents the first example of a silk gland-restricted bHLH protein, and its expression pattern suggests that SGSF plays a role in regulating differentiation of cells in the spider that control silk gland formation or egg case silk gene expression.",2005,"Craig A Vierra, Amardeep Sembhi, William Thayer, Anne M F Moore, Trang Le, Kristin Kohler, Keshav Vasanthavada"
Bunched sets a boundary for Notch signaling to pattern anterior eggshell structures during Drosophila oogenesis,16223477,10.1016/j.ydbio.2005.09.019,"Organized boundaries between different cell fates are critical in patterning and organogenesis. In some tissues, long-range signals position a boundary, and local Notch signaling maintains it. How Notch activity is restricted to boundary regions is not well understood. During Drosophila oogenesis, the long-range signals EGF and Dpp regulate expression of bunched (bun), which encodes a homolog of mammalian transcription factors TSC-22 and GILZ. Here, we show that bun establishes a boundary for Notch signaling in the follicle cell epithelium. Notch signaling is active in anterior follicle cells and is required for concurrent follicle cell reorganizations including centripetal migration and operculum formation. bun is required in posterior columnar follicle cells to repress the centripetal migration fate, including gene expression, cell shape changes and accumulation of cytoskeletal components. bun mutant clones adjacent to the centripetally migrating follicle cells showed ectopic Notch responses. bun is necessary, but not sufficient, to down-regulate Serrate protein levels throughout the follicular epithelium. These data indicate that Notch signaling is necessary, but not sufficient, for centripetal migration and that bun regulates the level of Notch stimulation to position the boundary between centripetally migrating and stationary columnar follicle cells.",2005,"Alejandra Jaeger, Jeanne S Peterson, Laurel A Raftery, Leonard Dobens"
"Centrophobism/thigmotaxis, a new role for the mushroom bodies in Drosophila",15547935,10.1002/neu.20111,"Insects, like vertebrates, exhibit spatially complex locomotor activity patterns when foraging or navigating. Open field studies recently showed that Drosophila avoids central zones and stays at the periphery, an effect that can be interpreted as centrophobism and/or thigmotaxis. In this study, we further characterized this phenomenon and studied the responsible underlying neural mechanisms. The implication of the Drosophila mushroom bodies (MBs) in olfactory learning and memory processes is well documented. In an open field situation in which fly locomotor activity is recorded by video tracking, we show that center avoidance is greatly diminished in flies with hydroxyurea-ablated MBs, suggesting a new role for these structures. Furthermore, the temperature-sensitive allele of the dynamin gene shibire was expressed in various enhancer-trap P[GAL4] lines, disrupting synaptic transmission in different MB lobes. Specifically blocking the gamma lobes alters centrophobism/thigmotaxis while blocking the alpha/beta lobes does not, suggesting a functional specialization of MB lobes. Drosophila may serve as a new model system for elucidating the genetic and neural bases of such complex phenomena as centrophobism/thigmotaxis.",2005,"Jean-René Martin, Morgane Besson"
The RNA-binding protein Squid is required for the establishment of anteroposterior polarity in the Drosophila oocyte,16291786,10.1242/dev.02159,"The heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) Squid (Sqd) is a highly abundant protein that is expected to bind most cellular RNAs. Nonetheless, Sqd plays a very specific developmental role in dorsoventral (DV) axis formation during Drosophila oogenesis by localizing gurken (grk) RNA. Here, we report that Sqd is also essential for anteroposterior (AP) axis formation. We identified sqd in a screen for modifiers of the Protein Kinase A (PKA) oogenesis polarity phenotype. The AP defects of sqd mutant oocytes resemble those of PKA mutants in several ways. In both cases, the cytoskeletal reorganization at mid-oogenesis, which depends on a signal from the posterior follicle cells, does not produce a correctly polarized microtubule (MT) network. This causes the posterior determinant, oskar (osk) RNA, to localize to central regions of the oocyte, where it is ectopically translated. Additionally, MT-dependent anterior movement of the oocyte nucleus and the grk-dependent specification of posterior follicle cells are unaffected in both mutants. However, in contrast to PKA mutants, sqd mutants do not retain a discrete posterior MT organizing center (MTOC) capable of supporting ectopic posterior localization of bicoid (bcd) RNA. sqd mutants also display several other phenotypes not seen in PKA mutants; these probably result from the disruption of MT polarity in earlier stages of oogenesis. Loss of Sqd does not affect polarity in follicle cells, wings or eyes, indicating a specific role in the determination of MT polarity within the germline.",2005,"Daniel Kalderon, Josefa Steinhauer"
Tid1 negatively regulates the migratory potential of cancer cells by inhibiting the production of interleukin-8,16204048,10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-4422,"Tid1 is the human homologue of the Drosophila tumor suppressor, Tid56. Reducing the expression of Tid1 in MDA-MB231 breast cancer cells enhanced their migration without affecting their survival or growth rate. From microarray screening, we discovered that after Tid1 depletion, the mRNA level of interleukin-8 (IL-8) was significantly increased in these cancer cells, which consequently increased secretion of IL-8 protein by 3.5-fold. The enhanced migration of these Tid1-knockdown cells was blocked by reducing the IL-8 expression or by adding an IL-8 neutralizing antibody to the culture medium, suggesting that enhancement of cell motility in these Tid1-deficient cells is dependent on the de novo synthesis of IL-8. Subsequently, we found that abrogating the nuclear factor kappaB binding site in the IL-8 promoter completely blocked the Tid1 depletion-induced IL-8 expression in the breast cancer cells. As increased IL-8 levels are known to promote tumor metastasis, we tested the effect of Tid1 knockdown on tumor metastasis and found that Tid1 depletion enhanced the metastasis of breast cancer cells in animals. Together, these results indicate that Tid1 negatively regulates the motility and metastasis of breast cancer cells, most likely through attenuation of nuclear factor kappaB activity on the promoter of the IL8 gene.",2005,"Sung-Woo Kim, Jeng-Fan Lo, Gwendal Lazennec, Jiing-Dwan Lee, Young Yang, Rong Xiang, Masaaki Hayashi, Colleen Fearns"

A correlation between the levels of E75 expression and the levels of available heme suggest a possible role as a heme sensor. The oxidation state of the heme iron also determines whether E75 can interact with its heterodimer partner DHR3, suggesting an additional role as a redox sensor.

Human expanded polyglutamine androgen receptor mutants in neurodegeneration as a novel ligand target,16079302,10.1124/jpet.105.087643,"Androgen receptor (AR) plays key roles in various biological events, including pathological processes such as prostate cancer, androgen-insensitive syndrome, and spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA). SBMA is caused by mutation of the expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) stretches in the AR gene. Recently, we established a Drosophila SBMA model that expresses the expanded polyQ hAR mutant in eyes, which monitors neurodegeneration as a rough eye phenotype. In addition, we showed that androgen binding to the mutant hAR causes structural alterations, leading to the onset of neurodegeneration in the fly eyes. In the present study, we examined whether the ligand-induced neurodegeneration via the hAR mutant is coupled with the known ligand-induced transactivation function of hAR. By testing several known AR antagonists and several of their structure-related compounds, we unexpectedly found that none of the AR ligands antagonized the hAR mutant neurodegeneration function, and surprisingly, compound 4-(4,4-dimethyl-2,5-dioxo-1-imidazolidinyl)-2-trifluoromethylbenzonitrile (RU56279) was more potent in inducing neurodegeneration. However, in vitro and in vivo mammalian assays showed that RU56279 exhibited the expected antagonistic activity with the same potency as those of the other compounds.

Hox genes and their candidate downstream targets in the developing central nervous system,16075387,10.1007/s10571-005-3971-9,"1. Homeobox (Hox) genes were originally discovered in the fruit fly Drosophila, where they function through a conserved homeodomain as transcriptional regulators to control embryonic morphogenesis. Since then over 1000 homeodomain proteins have been identified in several species. In vertebrates, 39 Hox genes have been identified as homologs of the original Drosophila complex, and like their Drosophila counterparts they are organized within chromosomal clusters. Vertebrate Hox genes have also been shown to play a critical role in embryonic development as transcriptional regulators. 2. Both the Drosophila and vertebrate Hox genes have been shown to interact with various cofactors, such as the TALE homeodomain proteins, in recognition of consensus sequences within regulatory elements of their target genes. These protein-protein interactions are believed to contribute to enhancing the specificity of target gene recognition in a cell-type or tissue- dependent manner. The regulatory activity of a particular Hox protein on a specific regulatory element is highly variable and dependent on its interacting partners within the transcriptional complex. 3. In vertebrates, Hox genes display spatially restricted patterns of expression within the developing CNS, both along the anterioposterior and dorsoventral axis of the embryo. Their restricted gene expression is suggestive of a regulatory role in patterning of the CNS, as well as in cell specification. Determining the precise function of individual Hox genes in CNS morphogenesis through classical mutational analyses is complicated due to functional redundancy between Hox genes. 4. Understanding the precise mechanisms through which Hox genes mediate embryonic morphogenesis requires the identification of their downstream target genes. Although Hox genes have been implicated in the regulation of several pathways, few target genes have been shown to be under their direct regulatory control. Development of methodologies used for the isolation of target genes and for the analysis of putative targets will be beneficial in establishing the genetic pathways controlled by Hox factors. 5. Within the developing CNS various cell adhesion molecules and signaling molecules have been identified as candidate downstream target genes of Hox proteins. These targets play a role in processes such as cell migration and differentiation, and are implicated in contributing to neuronal processes such as plasticity and/or specification. Hence, Hox genes not only play a role in patterning of the CNS during early development, but may also contribute to cell specification and identity.",2005,"A J Nazarali, Z N Akin"
Seizure suppression by gain-of-function escargot mutations,15654097,10.1534/genetics.104.036558,"Suppressor mutations provide potentially powerful tools for examining mechanisms underlying neurological disorders and identifying novel targets for pharmacological intervention. Here we describe mutations that suppress seizures in a Drosophila model of human epilepsy. A screen utilizing the Drosophila easily shocked (eas) ""epilepsy"" mutant identified dominant suppressors of seizure sensitivity. Among several mutations identified, neuronal escargot (esg) reduced eas seizures almost 90%. The esg gene encodes a member of the snail family of transcription factors. Whereas esg is normally expressed in a limited number of neurons during a defined period of nervous system development, here normal esg was expressed in all neurons and throughout development. This greatly ameliorated both the electrophysiological and the behavioral epilepsy phenotypes of eas. Neuronal esg appears to act as a general seizure suppressor in the Drosophila epilepsy model as it reduces the susceptibility of several seizure-prone mutants. We observed that esg must be ectopically expressed during nervous system development to reduce seizure susceptibility in adults. Furthermore, induction of esg in a small subset of neurons (interneurons) will reduce seizure susceptibility. A combination of microarray and computational analyses revealed 100 genes that represent possible targets of neuronal esg.

The 'lipid raft' microdomain proteins reggie-1 and reggie-2 (flotillins) are scaffolds for protein interaction and signalling,15649135,10.1042/bss0720109,"Reggie-1 and reggie-2 are two evolutionarily highly conserved proteins which are up-regulated in retinal ganglion cells during regeneration of lesioned axons in the goldfish optic nerve. They are located at the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane and are considered to be 'lipid raft' constituents due to their insolubility in Triton X-100 and presence in the 'floating fractions'; hence they were independently named flotillins. According to our current view, the reggies subserve functions as protein scaffolds which form microdomains in neurons, lymphocytes and many other cell types across species as distant as flies and humans. These microdomains are of a surprisingly constant size of less than or equal to 0.1 mm in all cell types, whereas the distance between them is variable. The microdomains co-ordinate signal transduction of specific cell-surface proteins and especially of GPI (glycosylphosphatidylinositol)-anchored proteins into the cell, as is demonstrated for PrP(c) (cellular prion protein) in T-lymphocytes. These cells possess a pre-formed reggie cap scaffold consisting of densely packed reggie microdomains. PrP(c) is targeted to the lymphocyte reggie cap when activated by antibody cross-linking, and induces a distinct Ca(2+) signal. In developing zebrafish, reggies become concentrated in neurons and axon tracts, and their absence, after morpholino antisense RNA-knockdown, results in deformed embryos with reduced brains. Likewise, defects in Drosophila eye morphogenesis occur upon reggie overexpression in mutant flies. The defects observed in the organism, as well as in single cells in culture, indicate a morphogenetic function of the reggies, with emphasis on the nervous system. This complies with their role as scaffolds for the formation of multiprotein complexes involved in signalling across the plasma membrane.",2005,"Claudia A O Stuermer, Helmut Plattner"
"In Drosophila melanogaster, the rolling pebbles isoform 6 (Rols6) is essential for proper Malpighian tubule morphology",16169193,10.1016/j.mod.2005.07.001,"During myoblast fusion, cell-cell recognition along with cell migration and adhesion are essential biological processes. The factors involved in these processes include members of the immunoglobulin superfamily like Sticks and stones (Sns), Dumbfounded (Duf) and Hibris (Hbs), SH3 domain-containing adaptor molecules like Myoblast city (Mbc) and multidomain proteins like Rolling pebbles (Rols). For rolling pebbles, two differentially expressed transcripts have been defined (rols7 and rols6). However, to date, only a muscle fusion phenotype has been described and assigned to the lack of the mesoderm-specific expressed rols7 transcript. Here, we show that a loss of the second rolling pebbles transcript, rols6, which is expressed from the early bud to later embryonic stages during Malpighian tubule (MpT) development, leads to an abnormal MpT morphology that is not due to defects in cell determination or proliferation but to aberrant morphogenesis. In addition, when Myoblast city or Rac are knocked out, a similar phenotype is observed. Myoblast city and Rac are essentially involved in the development of the somatic muscles and were proposed to be interaction partners of Rols7. Because of the predicted structural similarities of the Rols7 and Rols6 proteins, we argue that genetic interaction of rols6, mbc and rac might lead to proper MpT morphology.

These two periods correspond to kinetochore alignment at metaphase and to mitosis exit, respectively. We also demonstrated that these two delays are the consequence of damage specifically induced by Tat on kinetochore alignment and on the timing of sister chromatid segregation at anaphase. Furthermore, we show that the expression of Tat in Drosophila larvae brain cells produces a significant percentage of polyploid and aneuploid cells. The results reported here indicate that Tat impairs the mitotic process and that Tat-tubulin interaction appears to be responsible for the observed defects. The presence of polyploid and aneuploid cells is consistent with a delay or arrest in the M phase of a substantial fraction of the cells expressing Tat, suggesting that mitotic spindle checkpoints are overridden following Tat expression.",2005,"Valeria Naim, Franca Gigliani, Donatella Ponti, Piero A Battaglia, Serenella Venanzi, Rossana Psaila"

A central part of the evolutionary analysis of biological systems remains to decipher the causal connections between organism-wide (or genome-wide) attributes (e.g., mRNA abundance, protein length, codon bias, recombination rate, genomic position, mutation rate, etc) as well as their role-together with mutation, selection, and genetic drift-in shaping patterns of evolutionary variation in any of the attributes themselves. Here we combine genome-wide evolutionary analysis of protein and gene expression data to highlight fundamental relationships among genomic attributes and their associations with the evolution of both protein sequences and gene expression levels. Our results show that protein divergence is positively coupled with both gene expression polymorphism and divergence. We show moreover that although the number of protein-protein interactions in Drosophila is negatively associated with protein divergence as well as gene expression polymorphism and divergence, protein-protein interactions cannot account for the observed coupling between regulatory and structural evolution. Furthermore, we show that proteins with higher rates of amino acid substitutions tend to have larger sizes and tend to be expressed at lower mRNA abundances, whereas genes with higher levels of gene expression divergence and polymorphism tend to have shorter sizes and tend to be expressed at higher mRNA abundances. Finally, we show that protein length is negatively associated with both number of protein-protein interactions and mRNA abundance and that interacting proteins in Drosophila show similar amounts of divergence. We suggest that protein sequences and gene expression are subjected to similar evolutionary dynamics, possibly because of similarity in the fitness effect (i.e., strength of stabilizing selection) of disruptions in a gene's protein sequence or its mRNA expression. We conclude that, as more and better data accumulate, understanding the causal connections among biological traits and how they are integrated over time to constrain or promote structural and regulatory evolution may finally become possible.",2005,"Bernardo Lemos, Colin D Meiklejohn, Daniel L Hartl, Brian R Bettencourt"
Par-3 controls tight junction assembly through the Rac exchange factor Tiam1,15723052,10.1038/ncb1226,"The par (partitioning-defective) genes express a set of conserved proteins that function in polarization and asymmetric cell division. Par-3 has multiple protein-interaction domains, and associates with Par-6 and atypical protein kinase C (aPKC). In Drosophila, Par-3 is essential for epithelial cell polarization. However, its function in mammals is unclear. Here we show that depletion of Par-3 in mammalian epithelial cells profoundly disrupts tight junction assembly. Expression of a carboxy-terminal fragment plus the third PDZ domain of Par-3 partially rescues junction assembly, but neither Par-6 nor aPKC binding is required. Unexpectedly, Rac is constitutively activated in cells lacking Par-3, and the assembly of tight junctions is efficiently restored by a dominant-negative Rac mutant. The Rac exchange factor Tiam1 (ref. 7) binds directly to the carboxy-terminal region of Par-3, and knockdown of Tiam1 enhances tight junction formation in cells lacking Par-3. These results define a critical function for Par-3 in tight junction assembly, and reveal a novel mechanism through which Par-3 engages in the spatial regulation of Rac activity and establishment of epithelial polarity.",2005,"Xinyu Chen, Ian G Macara"
Generation and characterization of FMR1 knockout zebrafish,19936290,10.1371/journal.pone.0007910,"Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is one of the most common known causes of inherited mental retardation. The gene mutated in FXS is named FMR1, and is well conserved from human to Drosophila. In order to generate a genetic tool to study FMR1 function during vertebrate development, we generated two mutant alleles of the fmr1 gene in zebrafish. Both alleles produce no detectable Fmr protein, and produce viable and fertile progeny with lack of obvious phenotypic features. This is in sharp contrast to published results based on morpholino mediated knock-down of fmr1, reporting defects in craniofacial development and neuronal branching in embryos. These phenotypes we specifically addressed in our knock-out animals, revealing no significant deviations from wild-type animals, suggesting that the published morpholino based fmr1 phenotypes are potential experimental artifacts. Therefore, their relation to fmr1 biology is questionable and morpholino induced fmr1 phenotypes should be avoided in screens for potential drugs suitable for the treatment of FXS. Importantly, a true genetic zebrafish model is now available which can be used to study FXS and to derive potential drugs for FXS treatment.",2009,"Rob Willemsen, Judith R Brouwer, Ben A Oostra, Herma van der Linde, Marjo J den Broeder, René F Ketting"
Poly-N-methylated amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) C-terminal fragments reduce Abeta toxicity in vitro and in Drosophila melanogaster,19908889,10.1021/jm901092h,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), an age related neurodegenerative disorder, threatens to become a major health-economic problem.

The C-terminal part plays an important role in Abeta aggregation, but most Abeta aggregation inhibitors have targeted the central region around residues 16-23. Herein, we synthesized hexapeptides with varying extents of N-methylation based on residues 32-37 of Abeta, to target its C-terminal region. We measured the peptides' abilities to retard beta-sheet and fibril formation of Abeta and to reduce Abeta neurotoxicity.

The biogenesis and function of PIWI proteins and piRNAs: progress and prospect,19575643,10.1146/annurev.cellbio.24.110707.175327,"The evolutionarily conserved Argonaute/PIWI (AGO/PIWI, also known as PAZ-PIWI domain or PPD) family of proteins is crucial for the biogenesis and function of small noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs). This family can be divided into AGO and PIWI subfamilies. The AGO proteins are ubiquitously present in diverse tissues. They bind to small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs). In contrast, the PIWI proteins are predominantly present in the germline and associate with a novel class of small RNAs known as PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs). Tens of thousands of piRNA species, typically 24-32 nucleotide (nt) long, have been found in mammals, zebrafish, and Drosophila. Most piRNAs appear to be generated from a small number of long single-stranded RNA precursors that are often encoded by repetitive intergenic sequences in the genome. PIWI proteins play crucial roles during germline development and gametogenesis of many metazoan species, from germline determination and germline stem cell (GSC) maintenance to meiosis, spermiogenesis, and transposon silencing. These diverse functions may involve piRNAs and may be achieved via novel mechanisms of epigenetic and posttranscriptional regulation.",2009,"Travis Thomson, Haifan Lin"
What was the set of ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like conjugating enzymes in the eukaryote common ancestor?,19452197,10.1007/s00239-009-9225-6,"Ubiquitin (Ub)-conjugating enzymes (E2) are key enzymes in ubiquitination or Ub-like modifications of proteins. We searched for all proteins belonging to the E2 enzyme super-family in seven species (Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Arabidopsis thaliana) to identify families and to reconstruct each family's phylogeny. Our phylogenetic analysis of 207 genes led us to define 17 E2 families, with 37 E2 genes, in the human genome. The subdivision of E2 into four classes did not correspond to the phylogenetic tree. The sequence signature HPN (histidine-proline-asparagine), followed by a tryptophan residue at 16 (up to 29) amino acids, was highly conserved. When present, the active cysteine was found 7 to 8 amino acids from the C-terminal end of HPN. The secondary structures were characterized by a canonical alpha/beta fold. Only family 10 deviated from the common organization because the proteins were devoid of enzymatic activity. Family 7 had an insertion between beta strands 1 and 2; families 3, 5 and 14 had an insertion between the active cysteine and the conserved tryptophan. The three-dimensional data of these proteins highlight a strong structural conservation of the core domain. Our analysis shows that the primitive eukaryote ancestor possessed a diversified set of E2 enzymes, thus emphasizing the importance of the Ub pathway. This comprehensive overview of E2 enzymes emphasizes the diversity and evolution of this superfamily and helps clarify the nomenclature and true orthologies.

We used Cre-LoxP conditional gene targeting to knock down Rac1 expression in mouse rod photoreceptors and found protection against light-induced photoreceptor death compared with WT litter-mates.

These results implicate both neuronal Rac1 and NADPH oxidase in cell death in this model of CNS degeneration.

Sulfation of eggshell components by Pipe defines dorsal-ventral polarity in the Drosophila embryo,19540119,10.1016/j.cub.2009.05.050,"Drosophila embryonic dorsal-ventral (DV) polarity is controlled by a group of sequentially acting serine proteases located in the fluid-filled perivitelline space between the embryonic membrane and the eggshell, which generate the ligand for the Toll receptor on the ventral side of the embryo. Spatial control of the protease cascade relies on the Pipe sulfotransferase, a fly homolog of vertebrate glycosaminoglycan-modifying enzymes, which is expressed in ventral cells of the follicular epithelium surrounding the developing oocyte. Here we show that the vitelline membrane-like (VML) protein undergoes Pipe-dependent sulfation and, consistent with a role in conveying positional information from the egg chamber to the embryo, becomes incorporated into the eggshell at a position corresponding to the location of the follicle cells from which it was secreted. Although VML influences embryonic DV pattern in a sensitized genetic background, VML is not essential for DV axis formation, suggesting that there is redundancy in the composition of the Pipe enzymatic target. Correspondingly, we find that additional structural components of the vitelline membrane undergo Pipe-dependent sulfation. In identifying the elusive targets of Pipe, this work points to the vitelline membrane as the source of signals that generate the Drosophila DV axis.",2009,"Leslie M Stevens, Zhenyu Zhang, David Stein"

To understand the sorting process, we developed a system to observe single-molecule motility in a cellular context. We followed myosin classes V, VI, and X on triton-extracted actin cytoskeletons from Drosophila S2, mammalian COS-7, and mammalian U2OS cells. We find that these cells vary considerably in their global traffic patterns. The S2 and U2OS cells have regions of actin that either enhance or inhibit specific myosin classes. U2OS cells allow for 1 motor class, myosin VI, to move along stress fiber bundles, while motility of myosin V and X are suppressed. Myosin X motors are recruited to filopodia and the lamellar edge in S2 cells, whereas myosin VI motility is excluded from the same regions. Furthermore, we also see different velocities of myosin V motors in central regions of S2 cells, suggesting regional control of motor motility by the actin cytoskeleton. We also find unexpected features of the actin cytoskeletal network, including a population of reversed filaments with the barbed-end toward the cell center.

Abi plays an opposing role to Abl in Drosophila axonogenesis and synaptogenesis,19675132,10.1242/dev.033324,"Abl tyrosine kinase (Abl) regulates axon guidance by modulating actin dynamics. Abelson interacting protein (Abi), originally identified as a kinase substrate of Abl, also plays a key role in actin dynamics, yet its role with respect to Abl in the developing nervous system remains unclear.

However, reducing abi gene dosage by half substantially rescues Abl mutant phenotypes in pupal lethality, axonal guidance defects and locomotion deficits. Moreover, we show that mutations in Abl increase synaptic growth and spontaneous synaptic transmission frequency at the neuromuscular junction. Double heterozygosity for abi and enabled (ena) also suppresses the synaptic overgrowth phenotypes of Abl mutants, suggesting that Abi acts cooperatively with Ena to antagonize Abl function in synaptogenesis. Intriguingly, overexpressing Abi or Ena alone in cultured cells dramatically redistributed peripheral F-actin to the cytoplasm, with aggregates colocalizing with Abi and/or Ena, and resulted in a reduction in neurite extension. However, co-expressing Abl with Abi or Ena redistributed cytoplasmic F-actin back to the cell periphery and restored bipolar cell morphology.

Molecular evolution and functional diversification of fatty acid desaturases after recurrent gene duplication in Drosophila,19307313,10.1093/molbev/msp057,"Frequent gene duplications in the genome incessantly supply new genetic materials for functional innovation presumably driven by positive Darwinian selection. This mechanism in the desaturase gene family has been proposed to be important in triggering the pheromonal diversification in insects. With the recent completion of a dozen Drosophila genomes, a genome-wide perspective is possible. In this study, we first identified homologs of desaturase genes in 12 Drosophila species and noted that while gene duplication events are relatively frequent, gene losses are not scarce, especially in the desat1-desat2-desatF clade. By reconciling the gene tree with species phylogeny and the chromosomal synteny of the sequenced Drosophila genomes, at least one gene loss in desat2 and a minimum of six gene gains (resulting in seven desatF homologs, alpha-eta), three gene losses and one relocation in desatF were inferred. Upon branching off the ancestral desat1 lineage, both desat2 and desatF gained novel functions through accelerating protein evolution. The amino acid residues under positive selection located near the catalytic sites and the C-terminal region might be responsible for altered substrate selectivity between closely related species. The association between the expression pattern of desatF-alpha and the chemical composition of cuticular hydrocarbons implies that the ancestral function of desatF-alpha is the second desaturation at the four carbons after the first double bond in diene synthesis, and the shift from bisexual to female-specific expression in desatF-alpha occurred in the ancestral lineage of Drosophila melanogaster subgroup. A relationship between the number of expressed desatF homologs and the diene diversification has also been observed. These results suggest that the molecular diversification of fatty acid desaturases after recurrent gene duplication plays an important role in pheromonal diversity in Drosophila.",2009,"Chuan-Chan Wang, Cheng-Ruei Lee, Shun-Chern Tsaur, Chau-Ti Ting, Shu Fang, Kuang-Hsi Chu"

This enhancer element is unusually rich in general regulatory sequences related to DNA recognition by multiple classes of eukaryotic transcription factors, including the DM motifs, homeodomain, and high mobility group box. Whereas free DNA is often crystallized as an A-form double helix, Dsx(A) was crystallized as B-DNA and thus provides a model for the prebound conformation of diverse regulatory DNA complexes. Sequence-dependent conformational properties that extend features of shorter B-DNA fragments with respect to double helical parameters, groove widths, hydration, and binding of divalent metal ions are observed. The structure also exhibits a sequence-dependent pattern of isotropic thermal B-factors, suggesting possible variation in the local flexibility of the DNA backbone.

DNA damage responses in Drosophila nbs mutants with reduced or altered NBS function,19395318,10.1016/j.dnarep.2009.03.004,"The MRN complex, composed of MRE11, RAD50 and NBS, plays important roles in responding to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs).

To study functions of Drosophila NBS in DNA damage responses, we used a separation-of-function mutation that causes loss of the forkhead-associated (FHA) domain. Loss of the FHA domain resulted in hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation and defects in gap repair by homologous recombination, but had only a small effect on the DNA damage checkpoint response and did not impair DSB repair by end joining. We also found that heterozygosity for an nbs null mutation caused reduced gap repair and loss of the checkpoint response to low-dose irradiation.

Our phenotypic analysis, following the disruption of these two pathways, suggests that they function in a sequential manner. Suppressor of cyclic AMP receptor (SCAR) activity is required before the formation of pores in the membranes of fusing cells, whereas Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASp) promotes the expansion of nascent pores and completion of the fusion process. Genetic epistasis experiments are consistent with this step-wise temporal progression. Our observations further imply a separate, Rac-dependent role for the SCAR complex in promoting myoblast migration. In keeping with the sequential utilization of the two systems, we observe abnormal accumulations of filamentous actin at the fusion sites when both pathways are disrupted, resembling those present when only SCAR-complex function is impaired. This observation further suggests that actin-filament accumulation at the fusion sites might not depend on Arp2/3 activity altogether.",2009,"Boaz Gildor, Ben-Zion Shilo, R'ada Massarwa, Eyal D Schejter"
Variation of Leptopilina boulardi success in Drosophila hosts: what is inside the black box?,19773070,10.1016/S0065-308X(09)70006-5,"Interactions between Drosophila hosts and parasitoid wasps are among the few examples in which occurrence of intraspecific variation of parasite success has been studied in natural populations. Such variations can originate from three categories of factors: environmental, host and parasitoid factors. Under controlled laboratory conditions, it is possible to focus on the two last categories, and, using specific reference lines, to analyze their respective importance. Parasitoid and host contributions to variations in parasite success have largely been studied in terms of evolutionary and mechanistic aspects in two Drosophila parasitoids, Asobara tabida and, in more details, in Leptopilina boulardi. This chapter focuses on the physiological and molecular aspects of L. boulardi interactions with two Drosophila host species, while most of the evolutionary hypotheses and models are presented in Chapter 11 of Dupas et al.",2009,"D Colinet, C Anselme, Y Carton, M Poirié, A Dubuffet, S Dupas"
"dbx mediates neuronal specification and differentiation through cross-repressive, lineage-specific interactions with eve and hb9",19710170,10.1242/dev.037242,"Individual neurons adopt and maintain defined morphological and physiological phenotypes as a result of the expression of specific combinations of transcription factors. In particular, homeodomain-containing transcription factors play key roles in determining neuronal subtype identity in flies and vertebrates. dbx belongs to the highly divergent H2.0 family of homeobox genes. In vertebrates, Dbx1 and Dbx2 promote the development of a subset of interneurons, some of which help mediate left-right coordination of locomotor activity. Here, we identify and show that the single Drosophila ortholog of Dbx1/2 contributes to the development of specific subsets of interneurons via cross-repressive, lineage-specific interactions with the motoneuron-promoting factors eve and hb9 (exex). dbx is expressed primarily in interneurons of the embryonic, larval and adult central nervous system, and these interneurons tend to extend short axons and be GABAergic. Interestingly, many Dbx(+) interneurons share a sibling relationship with Eve(+) or Hb9(+) motoneurons. The non-overlapping expression of dbx and eve, or dbx and hb9, within pairs of sibling neurons is initially established as a result of Notch/Numb-mediated asymmetric divisions. Cross-repressive interactions between dbx and eve, and dbx and hb9, then help maintain the distinct expression profiles of these genes in their respective pairs of sibling neurons. Strict maintenance of the mutually exclusive expression of dbx relative to that of eve and hb9 in sibling neurons is crucial for proper neuronal specification, as misexpression of dbx in motoneurons dramatically hinders motor axon outgrowth.",2009,"Beth A Wilson, James B Skeath, Yi Zhu, Haluk Lacin"
Isolation of seven unique biogenic amine receptor clones from the honey bee by library scanning,9535160,10.1046/j.1365-2583.1998.72059.x,"The biogenic amine receptor genes constitute an ancient and highly divergent family within the larger superfamily of G-protein-coupled receptors. These receptors play a central role in modulating nerve cell activity and thus behaviour. Because the honey bee offers numerous advantages for behavioural studies we endeavoured to isolate as many members of this gene family as possible from the bee. We compared numerous approaches to gene isolation and found that PCR amplification from small subfractions of cDNA or genomic DNA libraries enabled us to isolate clones that are otherwise undetectable. In total we isolated seven biogenic amine receptor clones and identified five additional related sequences by low-stringency Southern hybridization. Two clones, AmBAR4 and AmBAR6, are 84% and 72% identical to the Drosophila 5-HT2 and D1b receptors, respectively, and probably represent orthologous genes. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that AmBAR5 clusters loosely with a variety of tyramine and octopamine receptors with which it shares <66% identity. The other four clones, AmBAR1, AmBAR2, AmBAR3 and AmBAR7, are weakly to moderately related (28-45% identical) to Drosophila dopaminergic or mammalian adrenergic receptors and probably represent receptors of these classes whose orthologues have not previously been isolated from any insect. The honey bee clones expand the size of the known insect biogenic amine receptor gene family to sixteen members. Therefore the size of the biogenic amine receptor gene family of insects approaches that of vertebrates. This is true despite the reduced behavioural and genetic complexity of the insects relative to vertebrate animals.",1998,"P R Ebert, D P Toma, J E Rowland"

The reduction in the level of the Rga product results in a complex modulation of white mRNA both positively and negatively, depending on the developmental stage. In addition to white, Rga also affects the expression of several other tested genes, with one of them, Vinculin, being regulated in a strong sex-specific manner. Rga was cloned by transposon tagging. Its predicted product lacks any recognized nucleic acid-binding motif but is homologous to a global negative transcriptional regulator, CDC36 (NOT2), from yeast. Rga also acts as a suppressor of position effect variegation, suggesting that a possible function of Rga could be mediation of an interaction between chromatin proteins and the transcriptional complex.",1998,"E V Benevolenskaya, M V Frolov, J A Birchler"
"Mobile genetic elements, chiasmata, and the unique organization of beta-heterochromatin",9678343,10.1159/000014965,"Beta-heterochromatin in Drosophila and the Syrian hamster share a similar DNA organization, few unique sequences, and scrambled repeats of mobile elements without tandem repetition. DNA in alpha-heterochromatin is tandemly repetitious, and we now show that the repeat unit can either contain or lack a mobile element. The tandem repeat organization of alpha-heterochromatin is presumably due to a concertina-like mechanism of unequal exchange between repeat units. Although both heterochromatin types are late replicating and can incorporate mobile retroposons, the sequence distinction between the two heterochromatins appears to be due to a property conferred by chiasmata upon the process of homologous recombination in beta-heterochromatin but not in alpha-heterochromatin. Chiasmata seem to suppress the concertina mechanism of unequal exchange and impart to beta-heterochromatin its nontandem, scrambled repeat organization.",1998,"J Jurka, V V Kapitonov, G P Holmquist"
Response of the timeless protein to light correlates with behavioral entrainment and suggests a nonvisual pathway for circadian photoreception,9697865,10.1016/s0896-6273(00)80528-0,"The period (per) and timeless (tim) genes are required for circadian behavioral rhythms in Drosophila. The current model for how these rhythms entrain to light is based upon the light induced decrease in timeless protein (TIM) levels. We show here that the TIM response to light correlates with the effect of light on the behavioral rhythm. To identify components of the entrainment pathway, we also assayed the TIM response in flies with mutant visual systems. Flies that lacked eyes displayed a normal response in lateral neurons. The TIM response to a light pulse was attenuated in flies that were mutant for the transient receptor potential (trp) and trp-like (trpl) genes, which are required for calcium conductance in the visual transduction cascade. The reduced TIM response was accompanied by a reduced phase shift in the behavioral rhythm, but neither response was completely eliminated, and the trpl;trp flies entrain to light-dark cycles, suggesting that these genes perturb some aspect of circadian entrainment when mutated but are not essential for it. The TIM response was also unaffected in ninaE flies that lack the rhodopsin protein (rh1). These results support the hypothesis that circadian entrainment does not rely on the visual system and likely involves a dedicated pathway for photoreception.",1998,"Z Yang, H S Su, A Sehgal, M Emerson"

This bizarre condition, called hypercephaly, is rare, but has evolved independently among several insect orders and is most common in flies (Diptera). Earlier studies of geometrical optics and behavior have led to various hypotheses about possible adaptive advantages of eye stalks, such as enhanced stereoscopic vision while other hypothesis suggest that eye stalks are an outcome of sexual selection. Here, we focus on how these curious distortions of head/eye morphology are accompanied by changes in the neural organization of the visual system of Cyrtodiopsis quinqueguttata. Histological examinations reveal that the optic lobes, lamina (La), medulla (Me), lobula (Lo), and lobula plate (LP) are contained entirely within the fly's eye bulbs, which are located at the distal ends of the eye stalks. We report that the organization of the peripheral visual system (La and Me) is similar to that of other Diptera (e.g., Musca and Drosophila), but deeper visual areas (Lo and LP) have been more strongly modified. For example, in both the lobula and lobula plate, fewer but larger giant collector neurons are found. The most pronounced difference is the reduction in the number of wide-field vertical cells of the lobula plate, where there are only four relatively large fibers, as opposed to 11 in Musca. The ""fewer but larger"" neural organization may enhance the conduction velocities of these cells, but may result in a loss of spatial resolution. At the base of the eye bulb, axon bundles collect and form a long optic nerve that extends the length of the eye stalk. We suggest that this organization of the diopsid visual system provides evidence for the costs of possessing long eye stalks.",1998,"E K Buschbeck, R R Hoy"
Circadian clock function in isolated eyestalk tissue of crayfish,9802237,10.1098/rspb.1998.0507,"Electrical mass response of crayfish photoreceptors (electroretinogram) was recorded continuously for up to seven days in isolated preparations that consisted of the retina and lamina ganglionaris.

Acclimatization of animals to reversed light/dark cycles resulted in a phase reversal of the rhythm in vitro. The per (period) gene of Drosophila has been implicated in the genesis of rhythms in insects and in vertebrates.

Neocentromere activity of structurally acentric mini-chromosomes in Drosophila,9425896,10.1038/ng0198-30,"Chromosome fragments that lack centromeric DNA (structurally acentric chromosomes) are usually not inherited in mitosis and meiosis. We previously described the isolation, after irradiation of a Drosophila melanogaster mini-chromosome, of structurally acentric mini-chromosomes that display efficient mitotic and meiotic transmission despite their small size (under 300 kb) and lack of centromeric DNA. Here we report that these acentric mini-chromosomes bind the centromere-specific protein ZW10 and associate with the spindle poles in anaphase. The sequences in these acentric mini-chromosomes were derived from the tip of the X chromosome, which does not display centromere activity or localize ZW10, even when separated from the rest of the X. We conclude that the normally non-centromeric DNAs present in these acentric mini-chromosomes have acquired centromere function, and suggest that this example of 'neocentromere' formation involves appropriation of a self-propagating centromeric chromatin structure. The potential relevance of these observations to the identity, propagation and function of normal centromeres is discussed.",1998,"B C Williams, M L Goldberg, T D Murphy, G H Karpen"

Less prominent and completely reversed circadian rhythms of rBMAL1 mRNA were observed in the piriform and parietal cortices. The hybridization signals of rBMAL1 mRNA were also detected in the olfactory bulb, hippocampus, and cerebellum. Since the product of rBMAL1 was recently demonstrated to dimerize with the protein of a mammalian clock gene, Clock, and the protein complex was shown to bind the E Box in the promoter region of mPer1 (a mouse homologue to Drosophila clock gene, Per), rBMAL1 possibly plays a critical role in the clock mechanism generating the circadian oscillation in rats.",1998,"Y Tanahashi, M Nomura, H Abe, S Honma, M Ikeda, K Honma, M Namihira"

Fluid secretion assays demonstrated sensitivity to the chloride channel blockers 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoic acid, diphenylamine-2-carboxylate, anthracene-9-carboxylic acid, and niflumic acid. Electrophysiological analysis showed that the calcium-mediated increase in anion conductance was blocked by the same agents. Vibrating probe analysis revealed a small number of current density hot spots, coincident with ""stellate"" cells, that were abolished by low-chloride saline or the same chloride channel blockers. GAL-4-targeted expression of an aequorin transgene revealed that the neurohormone leucokinin elicits a rapid increase in intracellular calcium levels in stellate cells that precedes the fastest demonstrable physiological effect. Taken together, these data show that leucokinins act on stellate cells through intracellular calcium to increase transcellular chloride conductance through channels.

"The K box, a conserved 3' UTR sequence motif, negatively regulates accumulation of enhancer of split complex transcripts",9735368,,"Cell-cell interactions mediated by the Notch receptor play an essential role in the development of the Drosophila adult peripheral nervous system (PNS). Transcriptional activation of multiple genes of the Enhancer of split Complex [E(spl)-C] is a key intracellular response to Notch receptor activity. Here we report that most E(spl)-C genes contain a novel sequence motif, the K box (TGTGAT), in their 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs). We present three lines of evidence that demonstrate the importance of this element in the post-transcriptional regulation of E(spl)-C genes. First, K box sequences are specifically conserved in the orthologs of two structurally distinct E(spl)-C genes (m4 and m8) from a distantly related Drosophila species. Second, the wild-type m8 3' UTR strongly reduces accumulation of heterologous transcripts in vivo, an activity that requires its K box sequences. Finally, m8 genomic DNA transgenes lacking these motifs cause mild gain-of-function PNS defects and can partially phenocopy the genetic interaction of E(spl)D with Notchspl. Although E(spl)-C genes are expressed in temporally and spatially specific patterns, we find that K box-mediated regulation is ubiquitous, implying that other targets of this activity may exist. In support of this, we present sequence analyses that implicate genes of the iroquois Complex (Iro-C) and engrailed as additional targets of K box-mediated regulation.",1998,"E C Lai, J W Posakony, C Burks"
Wingless repression of Drosophila frizzled 2 expression shapes the Wingless morphogen gradient in the wing,9630221,10.1016/s0092-8674(00)81438-5,"In Drosophila wing imaginal discs, the Wingless (Wg) protein acts as a morphogen, emanating from the dorsal/ventral (D/V) boundary of the disc to directly define cell identities along the D/V axis at short and long range. Here, we show that high levels of a Wg receptor, Drosophila frizzled 2 (Dfz2), stabilize Wg, allowing it to reach cells far from its site of synthesis. Wg signaling represses Dfz2 expression, creating a gradient of decreasing Wg stability moving toward the D/V boundary. This repression of Dfz2 is crucial for the normal shape of Wg morphogen gradient as well as the response of cells to the Wg signal. In contrast to other ligand-receptor relationships where the receptor limits diffusion of the ligand, Dfz2 broadens the range of Wg action by protecting it from degradation.",1998,"K M Cadigan, R Nusse, E J Rulifson, M P Fish"
Inferences on genome-wide deleterious mutation rates in inbred populations of Drosophila and mice,9720282,,"A theoretical analysis was carried out on the mutation load observed in long-maintained inbred lines from two experiments with Drosophila and mice. The rate of decline in fitness and its sampling distribution were predicted for both experiments using Monte Carlo simulation with a range of mutational parameters and models. The predicted rates of change in fitness were compared to the empirical observed rates, which were close to zero. The classical hypothesis of many deleterious mutations (about one event per genome per generation) of small effect (1-2%) resulting in a mutation pressure for fitness of about 1% per generation is incompatible with the data. Recent estimates suggesting an overall mutation pressure for fitness traits of about 0.1% are, however, compatible with the observed load.",1998,"P D Keightley, A Caballero"
A mutant Drosophila homolog of mammalian Clock disrupts circadian rhythms and transcription of period and timeless,9630223,10.1016/s0092-8674(00)81440-3,"We report the identification, characterization, and cloning of a novel Drosophila circadian rhythm gene, dClock.

Furthermore, these flies express low levels of the two clock proteins, PERIOD (PER) and TIMELESS (TIM), due to low per and tim transcription. Mapping and cloning of the Jrk gene indicates that it encodes the Drosophila homolog of mouse Clock. The mutant phenotype results from a premature stop codon that eliminates much of the putative activation domain of this bHLH-PAS transcription factor, thus explaining the dominant features of Jrk.

The aim of this study was to examine this possibility by characterizing the properties of TLE2 and extending the analysis of TLE1. It is shown here that TLE2 and TLE1 are transcriptional repressors that contain two separate repression domains, located either within a Gln-rich amino terminal region or within an internal domain characterized by an abundance of Ser, Thr, and Pro residues. In addition, both TLE2 and TLE1 can homo- and heterodimerize through a short region that is part of their amino-terminal transcription repression domains. Finally, TLE2 interacts and is co-expressed with mammalian HES proteins in both neural and non-neural tissues.

Germline transmission of mariner from one of three surviving birds confirmed transposition. Analysis of the first-generation (G1) chicks showed that they each contained between one and three copies of mariner. Six different transposition events were represented in the G1 birds, and the transposition was catalyzed by expression of the mariner element's transposase gene.

Oocyte polarity depends on regulation of gurken by Vasa,9521910,,"Vasa, a DEAD box mRNA helicase similar to eIF4A, is involved in pole plasm assembly in the Drosophila oocyte and appears to regulate translation of oskar and nanos mRNAs.

We find that vasa is required for the establishment of both anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral polarity of the oocyte. The polarity defects of vasa mutants appear to be caused by a reduction in the amount of Gurken protein at stages of oogenesis critical for the establishment of polarity. Vasa is required for translation of gurken mRNA during early oogenesis and for achieving wild-type levels of gurken mRNA expression later in oogenesis. A variety of early oogenesis phenotypes observed in vasa ovaries, which cannot be attributed to the defect in gurken expression, suggest that vasa also affects expression of other mRNAs.",1998,"A Ephrussi, A Guichet, P Zavorszky, P Tomancak"

The interaction of GAGA with triplex DNA cannot, however, stimulate transcription in vitro. The affinity of GAGA for triplexes of the purine motif, such as a d[AG(GA.TC)]22 intermolecular triplex, is significantly lower. The DNA binding domain of GAGA is sufficient for efficient binding to triplex DNA. Based on the reported solution structure of the complex of GAGA-DNA binding domain with double-stranded DNA, a model for its interaction with triplex DNA is proposed in which most of the protein-DNA contacts observed in duplex DNA are maintained, especially those occurring through the minor groove.

Mutually repressive interactions between the gap genes giant and Krüppel define middle body regions of the Drosophila embryo,1893878,,"The gap genes play a key role in establishing pair-rule and homeotic stripes of gene expression in the Drosophila embryo.

We show that Krüppel and giant are expressed in complementary, non-overlapping sets of cells in the early embryo. These complementary patterns depend on mutually repressive interactions between the two genes. Ectopic expression of giant in early embryos results in the selective repression of Krüppel, and advanced-stage embryos show cuticular defects similar to those observed in Krüppel- mutants. This result and others suggest that the strongest regulatory interactions occur among those gap genes expressed in nonadjacent domains.

The basic region of the widely expressed helix-loop-helix protein E12 is conserved at 8 of these 12 residues and can mediate DNA binding when placed in myogenin, but it cannot activate myogenesis. Replacement of each of the four nonconserved residues of the myogenin basic region with the corresponding residues of E12 reveals two adjacent amino acids (Ala86-Thr) that can impart muscle specificity to the basic region.

The Drosophila extramacrochaetae protein antagonizes sequence-specific DNA binding by daughterless/achaete-scute protein complexes,1764999,,"In Drosophila, a group of regulatory proteins of the helix-loop-helix (HLH) class play an essential role in conferring upon cells in the developing adult epidermis the competence to give rise to sensory organs. Proteins encoded by the daughterless (da) gene and three genes of the achaete-scute complex (AS-C) act positively in the determination of the sensory organ precursor cell fate, while the extramacrochaetae (emc) and hairy (h) gene products act as negative regulators. In the region upstream of the achaete gene of the AS-C, we have identified three 'E box' consensus sequences that are bound specifically in vitro by hetero-oligomeric complexes consisting of the da protein and an AS-C protein. We have used this DNA-binding activity to investigate the biochemical basis of the negative regulatory function of emc. Under the conditions of our experiments, the emc protein, but not the h protein, is able to antagonize specifically the in vitro DNA-binding activity of da/AS-C and putative da/da protein complexes. We interpret these results as follows: the heterodimerization capacity of the emc protein (conferred by its HLH domain) allows it to act in vivo as a competitive inhibitor of the formation of functional DNA-binding protein complexes by the da and AS-C proteins, thereby reducing the effective level of their transcriptional regulatory activity within the cell.",1991,"H M Ellis, J W Posakony, M Van Doren"
Mitochondrial DNA sequence divergence in the Melanogaster and oriental species subgroups of Drosophila,1920452,10.1007/BF02193630,"The nucleotide sequence of a segment of the mitochondrial DNA from three Drosophila species (D. erecta, D. eugracilis, and D. takahashii), belonging to different subgroups of the melanogaster group has been determined. The segment encompasses three complete tRNA genes (tRNAtrp, tRNAcys, and tRNAtyr) and portions of two protein-coding genes: the subunit 2 of the NADH dehydrogenase (ND2) and the subunit 1 of the cytochrome oxidase (COI). Comparisons also involve homologous sequences already known for four other Drosophila species of the melanogaster group. Length differences were confined in the intergenic region where a long stretch of AT repeats was observed in one of the species analyzed. The three tRNA genes exhibit very different evolutionary rates, the most slowly evolving one, tRNAtyr, is adjacent to the 5' end of COI; tRNAs in similar positions have been previously shown to evolve slowly because they are probably involved in transcript processing. Although the rate of synonymous substitutions was very similar between ND2 and COI genes there were strong discrepancies between them in terms of the number of nonsynonymous substitutions. Differences have also been found in G + C content of the genes, which are likely to be linked to different selective pressures. There is a reduction in G + C content in the region where selective constraints are reduced. This suggests the existence of different levels of constraints along the sequenced segment. An overall analysis of the types of substitutions showed a decrease in A + T content during the course of evolution of the species.",1991,"L Nigro, M Solignac, P M Sharp"
Comparison of several promoters and polyadenylation signals for use in heterologous gene expression in cultured Drosophila cells,1656386,10.1093/nar/19.18.5037,"We have directly compared the ability of four promoters and three polyadenylation (poly(A)) signals to direct heterologous gene expression in stably transfected Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells. We compared two constitutive Drosophila promoters, the actin 5C distal promoter and the alpha 1-tubulin promoter, with the tightly regulated Drosophila metallothionein (Mtn) promoter and the Bombyx mori fibroin promoter. We find that the actin 5C and induced Mtn promoters generate comparable high levels of RNA and protein in this system. The alpha 1-tubulin promoter generates about four-fold lower levels, and the fibroin promoter shows no detectable activity in S2 cells. Interestingly, genes expressed from the constitutive actin 5C and alpha 1-tubulin promoters are consistently present at three- to four-fold lower copy numbers than genes expressed from the inducible Mtn promoter or the inactive fibroin promoter. Poly(A) signals of both mammalian (SV40) and Drosophila (Mtn) origin efficiently directed stable RNA synthesis in S2 cells, and, as in mammalian cells, the SV40 late poly(A) signal was more efficient than the SV40 early poly(A) signal. Thus the process of polyadenylation appears to be conserved between mammalian and Drosophila cells.",1991,"M Ivey-Hoyle, M L Angelichio, J A Beck, H Johansen"
Chromosomal polymorphism and patterns of viability in natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster from cellar and vineyard,1774189,10.1038/hdy.1991.94,"Two neighbouring natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster have been analysed, one from a cellar habitat and the other from a vineyard outside. An extensive study of inversion polymorphism in the two populations has been carried out. Furthermore, the relationship between inversion polymorphism and the viability of the second chromosome has been studied. The data regarding the total frequency of inversion-carrying chromosomes indicate a lower frequency in the cellar population than in the vineyard population. Some possibilities that could explain the behaviour of the chromosomes from the cellar in relation to the peculiar environment of this habitat are discussed. New endemic inversions have been detected in both populations. With respect to the fitness component studied, no differences seem to exist between the cellar and vineyard populations. The frequencies of lethal-carrying chromosomes were the same in the two populations (0.267). There were no significant differences between the distribution patterns of the two populations for homozygote or for heterozygote viabilities.

As an essential step toward the understanding of the mechanisms involved in the immune response, we have isolated and characterized the lysozyme gene from Cecropia. The complete nucleotide sequence of the gene as well as the immediate flanking sequences have been determined. The gene includes three exons. Its first intron contains a repetitive sequence. In the evolutionary aspect, the Cecropia lysozyme gene and two vertebrate lysozyme genes have been found to maintain a similar organization pattern of exons. The lysozyme gene has been found to be strongly induced by lipopolysaccharides and a phorbol ester as well as bacteria. In the induction by bacteria, the lysozyme transcript appears at about 2 h, reaches to the maximum level at about 24 h, and then declines. Comparison of the 5'-flanking sequences with several other genes involved in the immune response of H. cecropia and Drosophila melanogaster revealed a kappa B-like consensus sequence.

Unexpectedly, flies transformed with such constructs are viable, despite spatial and temporal mis-regulation of pair-rule expression caused by the fusion genes. We show that fusion gene expression is transcriptionally regulated, such that ectopic expression is suppressed when pattern is established, and present evidence indicating that interstripe hb-ftz expression is repressed by eve. These results are considered in terms of redundant control of pair-rule gene striping.

Balanced translocation 12/13 and situs abnormalities: homology of early pattern formation in man and lower organisms?,2063904,10.1002/ajmg.1320380420,"Studies in ""lower"" organisms have identified a set of homologous sequences expressed in oocytes and early embryos that is critical for pattern formation. Mutations in such genes may exhibit maternal effect--they cause abnormalities in the fetus only when present in the mother. We report on a mother and child with identical, apparently balanced translocations having the breakpoints 12q13.1 and 13p13. The fetus had multiple anomalies including bilateral trilobar lungs, complex heart defect, malrotation of the gut, and asplenia, while the mother was entirely normal. Several hypotheses are advanced to explain this variable expression including transection of a gene with maternal effect--lateral asymmetry in the fetus is influenced by the maternal genotype. This explanation would account for the higher transmission of congenital heart disease to offspring by affected females noted in several studies. The human counterparts of 2 loci (int-1 and HOX 3) involved in Drosophila early pattern formation are located near the translocation breakpoint 12q13.1. If one of these genes is responsible for situs abnormality, then university of positional code (but not of embryologic mechanism) is suggested for higher metazoans.",1991,"S M Zneimer, L C Gilstrap, G N Wilson, N R Schneider, J P Stout"

Gene activation in the amphibian mesoderm,1742502,,"Cell potency is progressively restricted in amphibian development by a series of cellular interactions called inductions. The mesoderm is believed to develop in response to the earliest known induction, in which vegetal cells of the blastula divert overlying animal hemisphere cells away from epidermal and towards mesodermal fates. We describe two early markers of mesodermal differentiation in Xenopus laevis, both mRNAs that encode DNA-binding proteins of the helix-loop-helix family. One is a frog homologue of MyoD, a gene that in transfection experiments can convert cultured fibroblasts into myoblasts. Xenopus MyoD (XMyoD) is expressed in the early myotomes, from which the axial musculature develops. The accumulation of XMyoD RNA precedes that of transcripts from the cardiac actin gene, until now the earliest known marker of the muscle lineage, this result indicating that XMyoD could play a role in initiating muscle differentiation in normal development. We show by microinjection of synthetic RNA that XMyoD can indeed activate muscle-specific gene expression in animal cap cells, which would normally form only ectoderm. However, the XMyoD-injected animal caps did not produce differentiated muscle, suggesting that additional specific factors are required for full myogenesis. The other mRNA is a relative of the twist gene of Drosophila, which is required for mesodermal differentiation in flies. This gene (Xtwi) is expressed widely in the early frog mesoderm, but not, however, in the myotomes, where XMyoD is expressed. Later, the Xtwi gene is activated, in response to a second induction, in the developing neural crest.",1991,"J B Gurdon, N D Hopwood"
Unequal crossing-over within the B duplication of Drosophila melanogaster: a molecular analysis,1647352,10.1017/s0016672300029165,"The B mutation is associated with a tandem duplication of 16A1-16A7. It is unstable, mutating to wild type and to a more extreme form at a frequency of one in 1000 to 3000. The reversion to wild type is associated with the loss of one copy of the duplication, whereas the mutation to extreme B is associated with a triplication of the region. The instability of B has been attributed to unequal crossing-over between the two copies of the duplication. Recent molecular data show that there is a transposable element, B104, between the two copies of the duplication and support the hypothesis that this element generated the duplication via a recombination event. These data suggest that unequal crossing-over within the duplication may not be the cause of the instability of B. Instead, the instability may be caused by a recombination event involving the B104 element. This issue was addressed using probes for the DNA on either side of the B104 element at the B breakpoint. All of the data indicate that the B104 element is not involved in the instability of B and support the original unequal crossing-over model.",1991,S I Tsubota

In human cells, the mono-acetylated isoform H4Ac1 is acetylated predominantly at just one of the four possible lysine residues, lysine 16. This is the first step in the progressive acetylation of H4. In contrast, in Drosophila, H4Ac1 is acetylated at lysines 5, 8, or 12 with approximately equal frequency.

Interallelic complementation at the Drosophila melanogaster gastrulation defective locus defines discrete functional domains of the protein,11606540,,"The gastrulation defective (gd) locus encodes a novel serine protease that is involved in specifying the dorsal-ventral axis during embryonic development. Mutant alleles of gd have been classified into three complementation groups, two of which exhibit strong interallelic (intragenic) complementation. To understand the molecular basis of this interallelic complementation, we examined the complementation behavior of additional mutant alleles and sequenced alleles in all complementation groups. The data suggest that there are two discrete functional domains of Gd. A two-domain model of Gd suggesting that it is structurally similar to mammalian complement factors C2 and B has been previously proposed. To test this model we performed SP6 RNA microinjection to assay for activities associated with various domains of Gd. The microinjection data are consistent with the complement factor C2/B-like model. Site-directed mutagenesis suggests that Gd functions as a serine protease. An allele-specific interaction between an autoactivating form of Snake (Snk) and a gd allele altered in the protease domain suggests that Gd directly activates Snk in a protease activation cascade.

Misexpression of Xsiah-2 induces a small eye phenotype in Xenopus,11335112,10.1016/s0925-4773(01)00332-x,"Recent data demonstrate a structural and functional conservation of factors crucial for the development of the insect and the vertebrate eye. We isolated Xenopus siah-2, a protein with 67% identity to Drosophila sina (seven in absentia) and 85% identity to the mouse and human siah-2 proteins. Sina is required in Drosophila for the R7 photoreceptor cell formation during eye development, because it down regulates proteins that inhibit R7 differentiation via the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway. Nothing is known about the developmental function of the siah protein in vertebrates. We show that in Xenopus siah-2 is expressed maternally and is later restricted to the brain, spinal cord and the developing and mature eye. To demonstrate that the vertebrate factor participates in the process of eye formation we over expressed Xsiah-2 during Xenopus development and observed the formation of a small eye phenotype. The vertebrate counterpart of a C-terminal loss of function sina mutant, that causes a deficiency of the R7 photoreceptor cells in Drosophila, induces in Xenopus also smaller eyes. The small eyes are characterized by a reduced size of the lens, the retina and the pigmented epithelium. As this phenotype has been also described for flies expressing sina ectopically, the data demonstrate the functional and structural conservation of Xsiah-2 and sina in metazoan eye development.",2001,"S Senkel, S Bogdan, G U Ryffel, E Pogge v  Strandmann, F Esser"

The comparative genomics of polyglutamine repeats: extreme differences in the codon organization of repeat-encoding regions between mammals and Drosophila,11428462,10.1007/s002390010153,"Polyglutamine repeats within proteins are common in eukaryotes and are associated with neurological diseases in humans. Many are encoded by tandem repeats of the codon CAG that are likely to mutate primarily by replication slippage. However, a recent study in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has indicated that many others are encoded by mixtures of CAG and CAA which are less likely to undergo slippage. Here we attempt to estimate the proportions of polyglutamine repeats encoded by slippage-prone structures in species currently the subject of genome sequencing projects. We find a general excess over random expectation of polyglutamine repeats encoded by tandem repeats of codons. We nevertheless find many repeats encoded by nontandem codon structures. Mammals and Drosophila display extreme opposite patterns. Drosophila contains many proteins with polyglutamine tracts but these are generally encoded by interrupted structures. These structures may have been selected to be resistant to slippage. In contrast, mammals (humans and mice) have a high proportion of proteins in which repeats are encoded by tandem codon structures.

"Localization of a mammalian homolog of diaphanous, mDia1, to the mitotic spindle in HeLa cells",11171383,,"mDia1 is a mammalian homolog of Drosophila diaphanous and works as an effector of the small GTPase Rho. It is a member of the formin homology (FH) proteins and contains the Rho-binding domain and an FH3 region in its N terminus, an FH1 region containing polyproline stretches in the middle and an FH2 region in the C terminus. Several lines of evidence indicate that mDia1 and diaphanous are essential in cytokinesis. mDia1 is present in a large amount in the cytoplasm of both interphase and mitotic cells. Using the instantaneous fixation method that preferentially extracts soluble components, we have analyzed localization of mDia1 in mitotic HeLa cells. Immunocytochemistry using polyclonal anti-mDia1 antibody revealed specific immunofluorescence localized to the mitotic spindle. This localization was seen from prophase to telophase. Western blot analysis also detected anti-mDia1 immunoreactivity in the mitotic spindle fraction isolated from mitotic HeLa cells. Consistently, expression of full-length mDia1 as a fusion protein with green fluorescence protein (GFP) revealed the GFP fluorescence again in the mitotic spindle in HeLa cells. Expression of GFP fusions of various truncated mutants of mDia1 identified that this localization is determined by a 173 amino acid-long sequence between the Rho-binding domain and the FH1 region, which contains the C-terminal part of the FH3 region. Point mutation analysis revealed that Leu(434) and Leu(455) in the FH3 region are essential in localization to the mitotic spindle. Neither electroporation of botulinum C3 exoenzyme nor microinjection of Val14RhoA into mitotic cells affected the localization of endogenous mDia1 to the mitotic spindle, suggesting that mDia1 localizes to the mitotic spindle independent of Rho activity. The present study has thus established the mDia1 localization in the mitotic spindle. This localization suggests a role of mDia1 in the spindle-cleavage furrow interaction during cell division.",2001,"N Watanabe, T Ishizaki, A Fujita, T Kato, Y Morishima, S Narumiya"

Real-time imaging of cell-cell adherens junctions reveals that Drosophila mesoderm invagination begins with two phases of apical constriction of cells,11171319,,"Invagination of the epithelial cell sheet of the prospective mesoderm in Drosophila gastrulation is a well-studied, relatively simple morphogenetic event that results from dynamic cell shape changes and cell movements. However, these cell behaviors have not been followed at a sufficiently short time resolution. We examined mesoderm invagination in living wild-type embryos by real-time imaging of fluorescently labeled cell-cell adherens junctions, which are located at the apical zones of cell-cell contact. Low-light fluorescence video microscopy directly visualized the onset and progression of invagination. In an initial period of approximately 2 minutes, cells around the ventral midline reduced their apical surface areas slowly in a rather synchronous manner. Next, the central and more lateral cells stochastically accelerated or initiated their apical constriction, giving rise to random arrangements of cells with small and relatively large apices. Thus, we found that mesoderm invagination began with slow synchronous and subsequent fast stochastic phases of cell apex constriction. Furthermore, we showed that the mesoderm invagination of folded gastrulation mutant embryos lacked the normal two constriction phases, and instead began with asynchronous, feeble cell shape changes. Our observations suggested that Folded gastrulation-mediated signaling enabled synchronous activation of the contractile cortex, causing competition among the individual mesodermal cells for apical constriction.

Using the two-hybrid system, we have screened a D. melanogaster embryo cDNA library for proteins that interact with DmCKIIalpha. One of the cDNAs isolated in this screen encodes m7, a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)-type transcription factor encoded by the Enhancer of split complex (E(spl)C), which regulates neurogenesis. m7 interacts with DmCKIIalpha but not with DmCKIIbeta, suggesting that this interaction is specific for the catalytic subunit of DmCKII. In addition to m7, we demonstrate that DmCKIIalpha also interacts with two other E(spl)C-derived bHLH proteins, m5 and m8, but not with other members, such as m3 and mC. Consistent with the specificity observed for the interaction of DmCKIIalpha with these bHLH proteins, sequence alignment suggests that only m5, m7, and m8 contain a consensus site for phosphorylation by CKII within a subdomain unique to these three proteins. Accordingly, these three proteins are phosphorylated by DmCKIIalpha, as well as by the alpha2beta2 holoenzyme purified from Drosophila embryos. In line with the prediction of a single consensus site for CKII, replacement of Ser(159) of m8 with either Ala or Asp abolishes phosphorylation, identifying this residue as the site of phosphorylation. We also demonstrate that m8 forms a direct physical complex with purified DmCKII, corroborating the observed two-hybrid interaction between these proteins. Finally, substitution of Ser(159) of m8 with Ala attenuates interaction with DmCKIIalpha, whereas substitution with Asp abolishes the interaction. These studies constitute the first demonstration that DmCKII interacts with and phosphorylates m5, m7, and m8 and suggest a biochemical and/or structural basis for the functional equivalency of these bHLH proteins that is observed in the context of neurogenesis.",2001,"R L Trott, Z Paroush, M Kalive, A P Bidwai"
Mammalian Golgi-associated Bicaudal-D2 functions in the dynein-dynactin pathway by interacting with these complexes,11483508,10.1093/emboj/20.15.4041,"Genetic analysis in Drosophila suggests that Bicaudal-D functions in an essential microtubule-based transport pathway, together with cytoplasmic dynein and dynactin. However, the molecular mechanism underlying interactions of these proteins has remained elusive. We show here that a mammalian homologue of Bicaudal-D, BICD2, binds to the dynamitin subunit of dynactin. This interaction is confirmed by mass spectrometry, immunoprecipitation studies and in vitro binding assays. In interphase cells, BICD2 mainly localizes to the Golgi complex and has properties of a peripheral coat protein, yet it also co-localizes with dynactin at microtubule plus ends. Overexpression studies using green fluorescent protein-tagged forms of BICD2 verify its intracellular distribution and co-localization with dynactin, and indicate that the C-terminus of BICD2 is responsible for Golgi targeting. Overexpression of the N-terminal domain of BICD2 disrupts minus-end-directed organelle distribution and this portion of BICD2 co-precipitates with cytoplasmic dynein. Nocodazole treatment of cells results in an extensive BICD2-dynactin-dynein co-localization. Taken together, these data suggest that mammalian BICD2 plays a role in the dynein- dynactin interaction on the surface of membranous organelles, by associating with these complexes.",2001,"F Grosveld, N Galjart, R Willemsen, C I De Zeeuw, P Visser, B R Dortland, C C Hoogenraad, S A Howell, A Akhmanova"
Cooperative action of antioxidant defense systems in Drosophila,11525742,10.1016/s0960-9822(01)00393-1,"Molecular oxygen is key to aerobic life but is also converted into cytotoxic byproducts referred to as reactive oxygen species (ROS). Intracellular defense systems that protect cells from ROS-induced damage include glutathione reductase (GR), thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), superoxide dismutase (Sod), and catalase (Cat). Sod and Cat constitute an evolutionary conserved ROS defense system against superoxide; Sod converts superoxide anions to H(2)O(2), and Cat prevents free hydroxyl radical formation by breaking down H(2)O(2) into oxygen and water. As a consequence, they are important effectors in the life span determination of the fly Drosophila. ROS defense by TrxR and GR is more indirect. They transfer reducing equivalents from NADPH to thioredoxin (Trx) and glutathione disulfide (GSSG), respectively, resulting in Trx(SH)(2) and glutathione (GSH), which act as effective intracellular antioxidants. TrxR and GR were found to be molecularly conserved. However, the single GR homolog of Drosophila specifies TrxR activity, which compensates for the absence of a true GR system for recycling GSH. We show that TrxR null mutations reduce the capacity to adequately protect cells from cytotoxic damage, resulting in larval death, whereas mutations causing reduced TrxR activity affect pupal eclosion and cause a severe reduction of the adult life span. We also provide genetic evidence for a functional interaction between TrxR, Sod1, and Cat, indicating that the burden of ROS metabolism in Drosophila is shared by the two defense systems.",2001,"J P Phillips, H Jäckle, F Missirlis"

Their possible roles in the control of expression and processing of the 5S rRNA precursor molecule are discussed.",2001,"H Kress, U Swida, S Maletz, K Bechler"
Mechanism of the fluorescent light induced suppression of Curly phenotype in Drosophila melanogaster,11536279,10.1002/bem.65,"A dominant mutation Curly (Cy), frequently used as a marker on the second chromosome in Drosophila melanogaster, was previously shown to be suppressed by several factors, including larval crowding, low temperature, and fluorescent light. While the first two factors affect this mutation only partially, fluorescent tube exposed flies exhibit an almost completely suppressed (wild type) phenotype. This suppressive effect is the result of a combination of the electric field and light, both factors being produced by common fluorescent tubes. In this study, experiments were carried out to clarify the basic mechanism of this unique phenomenon. Two fluorescent tube sensitive stages of Drosophila development were found in the second half of embryonic development and first half of the pupal stage. Riboflavin, which is administered to Drosophila larvae with yeast, and decomposed by light, seems to play a key role in this phenomenon. In a medium lacking riboflavin caused by light exposure, Cy expression is inhibited by the action of electric field. Positive results of experiments with lithium ions, which block the opening of Ca(2+) channels, support the hypothesis that electromagnetic fields may alter ion currents during ontogenic development of Drosophila, and thus influence, expression of the Cy gene. Also, fluorescent light induces an overexpression of a specific protein in the imaginal wing disc of Cy pupae.",2001,"L Jindrák, J Pavelka"
Polo kinase and Asp are needed to promote the mitotic organizing activity of centrosomes,11283617,10.1038/35070110,"Interfering with the activity of polo-like kinases can lead to the formation of monopolar spindles. Polo-like kinases also regulate mitotic entry, activation of the anaphase-promoting complex and the necessary preconditions for cytokinesis. Similarities between the phenotypes of the Drosophila mutants asp and polo point towards a common role in spindle pole function. The abnormal spindles of asp mutants are bipolar but have disorganized broad poles at which gamma-tubulin has an abnormal distribution. Moreover, the synergism or of polo1 aspE3 double mutants indicates a possible involvement of these genes in a common process. Asp is a microtubule-associated protein of relative molecular mass 220,000 (Mr 220K) found at the face of the centrosome that contacts spindle microtubules. In partially purified centrosomes, it is required with gamma-tubulin to organize microtubule asters. Here, we show that Asp is the previously identified Mr 220K substrate of Polo kinase. Polo phosphorylates Asp in vitro, converting it into an MPM2 epitope. Polo and Asp proteins immunoprecipitate together and exist as part of a 25-38S complex. Extracts of polo-derived embryos are unable to restore the ability of salt-stripped centrosomes to nucleate microtubule asters. This can be rescued by addition of phosphorylated Asp or active Polo kinase.",2001,"D M Glover, M do Carmo Avides, A Tavares"
Modulation of a transcription factor counteracts heterochromatic gene silencing in Drosophila,11290322,10.1016/s0092-8674(01)00281-1,"Variegation is a common feature of gene silencing phenomena, yet the basis for stochastic on/off expression is unknown. We used a conditional system that allows probing of heterochromatin at a reporter GFP gene by altering GAL4 transcription factor levels during Drosophila eye development. Surprisingly, the frequency of gene silencing is exquisitely sensitive to GAL4 levels, as though binding site occupancy affects the silenced state. The silent state is plastic, as spontaneous derepression occasionally occurs in both mitotically active and differentiating cells. By simultaneously assaying expression of a nearby gene, we further show that the size of an activated region within heterochromatin is small. We propose that variegation occurs because heterochromatin inhibits the transient exposure of factor binding sites.",2001,"K Ahmad, S Henikoff"
Innexins get into the gap,11340620,10.1002/bies.1057,"Connexins were first identified in the 1970s as the molecular components of vertebrate gap junctions. Since then a large literature has accumulated on the cell and molecular biology of this multi-gene family culminating recently in the findings that connexin mutations are implicated in a variety of human diseases. Over two decades, the terms ""connexin"" and ""gap junction"" had become almost synonymous. In the last few years a second family of gap-junction genes, the innexins, has emerged. These have been shown to form intercellular channels in genetically tractable invertebrate organisms such as Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans. The completed genomic sequences for the fly and worm allow identification of the full complement of innexin genes in these two organisms and provide valuable resources for genetic analyses of gap junction function.",2001,"P Phelan, T A Starich"
Dscam2 mediates axonal tiling in the Drosophila visual system,17554308,10.1038/nature05855,"Sensory processing centres in both the vertebrate and the invertebrate brain are often organized into reiterated columns, thus facilitating an internal topographic representation of the external world. Cells within each column are arranged in a stereotyped fashion and form precise patterns of synaptic connections within discrete layers. These connections are largely confined to a single column, thereby preserving the spatial information from the periphery. Other neurons integrate this information by connecting to multiple columns. Restricting axons to columns is conceptually similar to tiling. Axons and dendrites of neighbouring neurons of the same class use tiling to form complete, yet non-overlapping, receptive fields. It is thought that, at the molecular level, cell-surface proteins mediate tiling through contact-dependent repulsive interactions, but proteins serving this function have not yet been identified. Here we show that the immunoglobulin superfamily member Dscam2 restricts the connections formed by L1 lamina neurons to columns in the Drosophila visual system. Our data support a model in which Dscam2 homophilic interactions mediate repulsion between neurites of L1 cells in neighbouring columns. We propose that Dscam2 is a tiling receptor for L1 neurons.",2007,"Wei Wu, S Lawrence Zipursky, S Sean Millard, Kartik S Pappu, John J Flanagan"
Distinct mechanisms for mRNA localization during embryonic axis specification in the wasp Nasonia,17434472,10.1016/j.ydbio.2007.03.012,"mRNA localization is a powerful mechanism for targeting factors to different regions of the cell and is used in Drosophila to pattern the early embryo. During oogenesis of the wasp Nasonia, mRNA localization is used extensively to replace the function of the Drosophila bicoid gene for the initiation of patterning along the antero-posterior axis. Nasonia localizes both caudal and nanos to the posterior pole, whereas giant mRNA is localized to the anterior pole of the oocyte; orthodenticle1 (otd1) is localized to both the anterior and posterior poles. The abundance of differentially localized mRNAs during Nasonia oogenesis provided a unique opportunity to study the different mechanisms involved in mRNA localization. Through pharmacological disruption of the microtubule network, we found that both anterior otd1 and giant, as well as posterior caudal mRNA localization was microtubule-dependent. Conversely, posterior otd1 and nanos mRNA localized correctly to the posterior upon microtubule disruption. However, actin is important in anchoring these two posteriorly localized mRNAs to the oosome, the structure containing the pole plasm. Moreover, we find that knocking down the functions of the genes tudor and Bicaudal-D mimics disruption of microtubules, suggesting that tudor's function in Nasonia is different from flies, where it is involved in formation of the pole plasm.",2007,"Eugenia C Olesnicky, Claude Desplan"
Diagnosing early ankylosing spondylitis,17915092,10.1007/s11926-007-0059-1,"Diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis is still delayed by many years. Several efforts have been made in the past few years to shorten this delay. A new set of criteria for inflammatory back pain has performed better than previous sets. MRI has evolved to become the standard imaging modality for the detection of sacroiliitis during early disease, and it clearly outperforms quantitative scintigraphy, which was the standard screening test for many years. Promising new developments such as whole body MRI and ultrasound (sonography) for the detection of enthesitis or sacroiliitis deserve further evaluation. Serum antibodies directed against a 28-kD Drosophila antigen may provide additional diagnostic information. A recently proposed diagnostic algorithm in patients with suspected early ankylosing spondylitis may help physicians confidently diagnose patients before definite radiographic sacroiliitis is detectable.

"Fitness variation in response to artificial selection for reduced cell area, cell number and wing area in natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster",17767726,10.1186/1471-2148-7-S2-S10,"Background: Genetically based body size differences are naturally occurring in populations of Drosophila melanogaster, with bigger flies in the cold. Despite the cosmopolitan nature of body size clines in more than one Drosophila species, the actual selective mechanisms controlling the genetic basis of body size variation are not fully understood. In particular, it is not clear what the selective value of cell size and cell area variation exactly is. In the present work we determined variation in viability, developmental time and larval competitive ability in response to crowding at two temperatures after artificial selection for reduced cell area, cell number and wing area in four different natural populations of D. melanogaster. Results: No correlated effect of selection on viability or developmental time was observed among all selected populations. An increase in competitive ability in one thermal environment (18 degrees C) under high larval crowding was observed as a correlated response to artificial selection for cell size. Conclusion: Viability and developmental time are not affected by selection for the cellular component of body size, suggesting that these traits only depend on the contingent genetic makeup of a population. The higher larval competitive ability shown by populations selected for reduced cell area seems to confirm the hypothesis that cell area mediated changes have a relationship with fitness, and might be the preferential way to change body size under specific circumstances.",2007,"Federico C F Calboli, Sandro Cavicchi, Vincenzo Trotta, Marcello Ziosi"
Male and female effects on sperm precedence in the giant sperm species Drosophila bifurca,16955327,10.1007/s10709-006-9103-8,"Sperm competition is expected to be a driving force in sexual selection. In internally fertilized organisms, it occurs when ejaculates from more than one male are present simultaneously within the female's reproductive tract. It has been suggested that greater sperm size may improve the competitive ability of sperm, but studies provide contradictory results depending on the species. More recently, the role of females in the evolution of sperm morphology has been pointed out. We investigate here the male and female effects that influence sperm precedence in the giant sperm species, Drosophila bifurca Patterson & Wheeler. Females were mated with two successive males, and the paternity outcomes for both males were analyzed after determining sperm transfer and storage. We found very high values of last male sperm precedence, suggesting a strong interaction between rival sperm. However, the data also indicate high frequencies of removal of the sperm of the first male from the female reproductive tract prior to any interaction with the second male. This implies that successful paternity depends mainly on successful sperm storage. Knowing what happens to the sperm within females appears to be a prerequisite for disentangling post-copulatory sexual interactions between males and females.",2007,"Dominique Joly, Sophie Huguenin, Stéphane Fruchard, Nathalie Luck, Béatrice Dejonghe"
Neuralized contains a phosphoinositide-binding motif required downstream of ubiquitination for delta endocytosis and notch signaling,18061562,10.1016/j.devcel.2007.10.020,"The Notch signaling pathway, which plays a critical role in cell-fate decisions throughout development, is regulated by endocytosis of both the ligand and receptor. Endocytosis of the Drosophila ligands, Delta and Serrate, is required in the signaling cell for signal initiation and requires one of two ubiquitin ligases, Neuralized or Mind bomb. Through in vitro binding assays we have identified an interaction between Neuralized and phosphoinositides, modified membrane lipids that mediate membrane trafficking and signaling. We show that interactions between phosphoinositides and Neuralized contribute to the membrane localization of Neuralized in the absence of Delta, and that the phosphoinositide-binding motif is required for Neuralized to endocytose Delta downstream of Delta ubiquitination. Lastly, we provide evidence that this interaction may also be important for vertebrate Neuralized function. These results demonstrate that, through interactions with Neuralized, phosphoinositides may regulate Delta endocytosis and, by extension, Notch signal transduction.",2007,"Gabrielle L Boulianne, Lara C Skwarek, Cosimo Commisso, Michael K Garroni"

Some seminal fluid proteins may provide protective functions to mated females, such as antimicrobial activity and/or stimulation of antimicrobial gene expression levels, while others appear to have negative effects, contributing to a ""cost of mating."" To identify seminal proteins that could participate in these phenomena, we used a systemic ectopic expression screen to test the effects on unmated females of proteins normally produced by the male accessory gland (Acps). Of the 21 ectopically expressed Acps that we tested for ability to assist in the clearance of a bacterial infection with Serratia marcescens, 3 Acps significantly reduced the bacterial counts of infected females, suggesting a protective role. Of the 23 Acps that we tested for toxicity, 3 were toxic, including one that has been implicated in the cost of mating in another study. We also tested ectopic expression females for other Acp-induced effects, but found no additional Acps that affected egg laying or receptivity upon ectopic expression.",2007,"Mariana F Wolfner, Jennifer L Page, Jacob L Mueller"
Protein expression in a Drosophila model of Parkinson's disease,17203978,10.1021/pr060488o,"Liquid chromatographies coupled to mass spectrometry and database analysis techniques are used to carry out a large-scale proteome characterization for a Drosophila model of Parkinson's disease.

Changes in gene expression at the level of the proteome are compared with changes reported from published transcriptome measurements. A summary of the comparison indicates that approximately 44% of transcripts that show changes can also be observed as proteins. However, the patterns of change in protein expression vary substantially compared with the patterns of change observed for corresponding transcripts. In addition, the expression changes of many genes are observed for only transcripts or proteins. Proteome measurements provide evidence for dysregulation of a group of proteins associated with the actin cytoskeleton and mitochondrion at presymptomatic and early disease stages that may presage the development of later symptoms. Overall, the proteome measurements provide a view of gene expression that is highly complementary to the insights obtained from the transcriptome.",2007,"Zhiyin Xun, Renã A Sowell, Thomas C Kaufman, David E Clemmer"
Activation of PAR-1 kinase and stimulation of tau phosphorylation by diverse signals require the tumor suppressor protein LKB1,17234589,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5094-06.2007,"Aberrant phosphorylation of tau is associated with a number of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD).

Microtubule affinity regulating kinase (MARK) and PAR-1 have been identified as physiological tau kinases, and aberrant phosphorylation of MARK/PAR-1 target sites in tau has been observed in AD patients and animal models. Here we show that phosphorylation of PAR-1 by the tumor suppressor protein LKB1 is required for PAR-1 activation, which in turn promotes tau phosphorylation in Drosophila. Diverse stress stimuli, such as high osmolarity and overexpression of the human beta-amyloid precursor protein, can promote PAR-1 activation and tau phosphorylation in an LKB1-dependent manner.

Constructing gene co-expression networks and predicting functions of unknown genes by random matrix theory,17697349,10.1186/1471-2105-8-299,"Background: Large-scale sequencing of entire genomes has ushered in a new age in biology. One of the next grand challenges is to dissect the cellular networks consisting of many individual functional modules. Defining co-expression networks without ambiguity based on genome-wide microarray data is difficult and current methods are not robust and consistent with different data sets. This is particularly problematic for little understood organisms since not much existing biological knowledge can be exploited for determining the threshold to differentiate true correlation from random noise. Random matrix theory (RMT), which has been widely and successfully used in physics, is a powerful approach to distinguish system-specific, non-random properties embedded in complex systems from random noise. Here, we have hypothesized that the universal predictions of RMT are also applicable to biological systems and the correlation threshold can be determined by characterizing the correlation matrix of microarray profiles using random matrix theory. Results: Application of random matrix theory to microarray data of S. oneidensis, E. coli, yeast, A. thaliana, Drosophila, mouse and human indicates that there is a sharp transition of nearest neighbour spacing distribution (NNSD) of correlation matrix after gradually removing certain elements insider the matrix. Testing on an in silico modular model has demonstrated that this transition can be used to determine the correlation threshold for revealing modular co-expression networks. The co-expression network derived from yeast cell cycling microarray data is supported by gene annotation. The topological properties of the resulting co-expression network agree well with the general properties of biological networks. Computational evaluations have showed that RMT approach is sensitive and robust. Furthermore, evaluation on sampled expression data of an in silico modular gene system has showed that under-sampled expressions do not affect the recovery of gene co-expression network. Moreover, the cellular roles of 215 functionally unknown genes from yeast, E. coli and S. oneidensis are predicted by the gene co-expression networks using guilt-by-association principle, many of which are supported by existing information or our experimental verification, further demonstrating the reliability of this approach for gene function prediction. Conclusion: Our rigorous analysis of gene expression microarray profiles using RMT has showed that the transition of NNSD of correlation matrix of microarray profile provides a profound theoretical criterion to determine the correlation threshold for identifying gene co-expression networks.",2007,"Feng Luo, Jianxin Zhong, Dorothea K Thompson, Jizhong Zhou, Latifur Khan, Yunfeng Yang, Haichun Gao"

"Titin in insect spermatocyte spindle fibers associates with microtubules, actin, myosin and the matrix proteins skeletor, megator and chromator",17591688,10.1242/jcs.03465,"Titin, the giant elastic protein found in muscles, is present in spindles of crane-fly and locust spermatocytes as determined by immunofluorescence staining using three antibodies, each raised against a different, spatially separated fragment of Drosophila titin (D-titin). All three antibodies stained the Z-lines and other regions in insect myofibrils. In western blots of insect muscle extract the antibodies reacted with high molecular mass proteins, ranging between rat nebulin (600-900 kDa) and rat titin (3000-4000 kDa). Mass spectrometry of the high molecular mass band from the Coomassie-Blue-stained gel of insect muscle proteins indicates that the protein the antibodies bind to is titin. The pattern of staining in insect spermatocytes was slightly different in the two species, but in general all three anti-D-titin antibodies stained the same components: the chromosomes, prophase and telophase nuclear membranes, the spindle in general, along kinetochore and non-kinetochore microtubules, along apparent connections between partner half-bivalents during anaphase, and various cytoplasmic components, including the contractile ring. That the same cellular components are stained in close proximity by the three different antibodies, each against a different region of D-titin, is strong evidence that the three antibodies identify a titin-like protein in insect spindles, which we identified by mass spectrometry analysis as being titin. The spindle matrix proteins skeletor, megator and chromator are present in many of the same structures, in positions very close to (or the same as) D-titin. Myosin and actin also are present in spindles in close proximity to D-titin.

The influence of methamidophos on predation by H. graminicola was very obvious in female spiders, which preyed on fewer prey in the 8 h after exposure to the insecticide but subsequently recovered. On the other hand, the predation rates in male spiders were not affected by the insecticide within 24 h of treatment. However, a 10% lethal dose (LD10) of methamidophos resulted in an enhanced predation rate per day for male spiders, whereas a 50% lethal dose reduced the predation rate. In addition, it was shown that the functional response of H. graminicola to the fruit fly was a type II response, and the type of functional response of insecticide-treated females changed from type II to type I, with no change in the response of male spiders. The attack rate of males treated with the LD10 dosage of insecticide was significantly higher than the controls, which suggests that the insecticide stimulates the performance of spiders. Prey utilization of males treated with low doses of insecticide was lower than the control, which indicates that the insecticide did not result in these spiders eating more prey, but killing more.",2007,"Jiayin Dai, Hong Cao, Lingling Deng, Muqi Xu"
Immunological detection of changes in genomic DNA methylation during early zebrafish development,17893737,10.1139/g07-055,"DNA methylation reprogramming, the erasure of DNA methylation patterns shortly after fertilization and their reestablishment during subsequent early development, is essential for proper mammalian embryogenesis.

Indeed, whether or not any widespread changes in DNA methylation occur at all during cleavage and blastula stages of fish in a fashion similar to that shown in mammals has remained controversial. Here we have addressed this issue by applying the techniques of Southwestern immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry with an anti-5-methylcytosine antibody to the examination of DNA methylation in early zebrafish embryos. These techniques have recently been utilized to demonstrate that development-specific changes in genomic DNA methylation also occur in Drosophila melanogaster and Dictyostelium discoideum, both organisms for which DNA methylation was previously not thought to occur.

ALK is a novel dependence receptor: potential implications in development and cancer,17611412,10.4161/cc.6.13.4433,"ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) is a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase, initially discovered as part of the NPM-ALK fusion protein, resulting from a chromosomal rearrangement frequently associated with anaplastic large cell lymphomas. The native ALK protein is normally expressed in the developing and, at a weaker level, adult nervous system. We recently demonstrated that ALK is a novel dependence receptor. As such, in the absence of ligand, the ALK receptor is kinase inactive and its expression results in enhanced apoptosis, whereas kinase activation, due to a ligand or constitutive as in NPM-ALK, decreases apoptosis. Unligated/kinase unactivated ALK receptor facilitates apoptosis via its own cleavage by caspases, a phenomenon allowing the exposure of a proapoptotic juxta-membrane intra-cellular domain. This review summarizes the biological significance of the ALK receptor in cancer and development, in perspective with its dependence receptor function. The dual function of ALK in the physiology of development is illustrated in the visual system of Drosophila. In this part of the nervous system, ALK in the presence of ligand appears essential for axonal guidance, whereas in the absence of ligand, ALK expression can lead to developmental neuronal apoptosis. ALK is also found expressed in neural crest-derived tumors such as human neuroblastomas or glioblastomas but its role is not fully elucidated. However, an excessive or constitutive ALK tyrosine kinase activation can lead to deregulation of cell proliferation and survival, therefore to human cancers such as lymphomas and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors. Our observations could have important implications in the therapy of ALK-positive tumors harboring the chimeric or wild type ALK protein.",2007,Michèle Allouche
Postsynaptic membrane addition depends on the Discs-Large-interacting t-SNARE Gtaxin,17267557,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3160-06.2007,"Targeted membrane addition is a hallmark of many cellular functions. In the nervous system, modification of synaptic membrane size has a major impact on synaptic function. However, because of the complex shape of neurons and the need to target membrane addition to very small and polarized synaptic compartments, this process is poorly understood. Here, we show that Gtaxin (GTX), a Drosophila t-SNARE (target-soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor), is required for expansion of postsynaptic membranes during new synapse formation. Mutations in gtx lead to drastic reductions in postsynaptic membrane surface, whereas gtx upregulation results in the formation of complex membrane structures at ectopic sites. Postsynaptic GTX activity depends on its direct interaction with Discs-Large (DLG), a multidomain scaffolding protein of the PSD-95 (postsynaptic density protein-95) family with key roles in cell polarity and formation of cellular junctions as well as synaptic protein anchoring and trafficking. We show that DLG selectively determines the postsynaptic distribution of GTX to type I, but not to type II or type III boutons on the same cell, thereby defining sites of membrane addition to this unique set of glutamatergic synapses.

Drosophila SnoN modulates growth and patterning by antagonizing TGF-beta signalling,17289352,10.1016/j.mod.2006.12.006,"Signalling by TGF-beta ligands through the Smad family of transcription factors is critical for developmental patterning and growth. Disruption of this pathway has been observed in various cancers. In vertebrates, members of the Ski/Sno protein family can act as negative regulators of TGF-beta signalling, interfering with the Smad machinery to inhibit the transcriptional output of this pathway. In some contexts ski/sno genes function as tumour suppressors, but they were originally identified as oncogenes, whose expression is up-regulated in many tumours. These growth regulatory effects and the normal physiological functions of Ski/Sno proteins have been proposed to result from changes in TGF-beta signalling. However, this model is controversial and may be over-simplified, because recent findings indicate that Ski/Sno proteins can affect other signalling pathways. To address this issue in an in vivo context, we have analyzed the function of the Drosophila Ski/Sno orthologue, SnoN. We found that SnoN inhibits growth when overexpressed, indicating a tumour suppressor role in flies. It can act in multiple tissues to selectively and cell autonomously antagonise signalling by TGF-beta ligands from both the BMP and Activin sub-families. By contrast, analysis of a snoN mutant indicates that the gene does not play a global role in TGF-beta-mediated functions, but specifically inhibits TGF-beta-induced wing vein formation. We propose that SnoN normally functions redundantly with other TGF-beta pathway antagonists to finely adjust signalling levels, but that it can behave as an extremely potent inhibitor of TGF-beta signalling when highly expressed, highlighting the significance of its deregulation in cancer cells.",2007,"R Foulger, M-C Ramel, C Wilson, C M Emery, D C I Goberdhan, M van den Heuvel"
Social behavior and the evolution of neuropeptide genes: lessons from the honeybee genome,17450560,10.1002/bies.20571,"Honeybees display a fascinating social behavior. The structural basis for this behavior, which made the bee a model organism for the study of communication, learning and memory formation, is the tiny insect brain. Neurons of the brain communicate via messenger molecules. Among these molecules, neuropeptides represent the structurally most-diverse group and occupy a high hierarchic position in the modulation of behavior. A recent analysis of the honeybee genome revealed a considerable number of predicted (200) and confirmed (100) neuropeptides in this insect. Is this quantity merely the result of advanced mass spectrometric techniques and bioinformatic tools or does it reflect the expression of more of these important messenger molecules, more than known from other insects studied so far? Our analysis of the data suggests that the social behavior is by no means correlated with a specific increase in the number of neuropeptides. Indeed, the honeybee genome is likely to contain fewer neuropeptide genes, neuropeptide paralogues and neuropeptide receptor genes than the solitary fruitfly Drosophila.",2007,"Reinhard Predel, Susanne Neupert"
In silico approach of azadirachtin binding with actins,17517340,10.1016/j.ibmb.2007.03.010,"In silico docking analysis reported here suggests that insect cellular cytoskeletal beta-actin could be the target of Azadirachtin A (Aza-the principle bioactive compound of neem seeds). The best docking energy of -40.09 kcal/mol at 8.73 A RMSD and predicted hydrogen bond between Arg210 and carboxymethyl group of Aza accompanied with seven hydrophobic interactions in the proposed binding site strongly support this hypothesis. This is of specific interest due to the non-affinity of Aza to mammalian beta-actins under the same set of conditions, although beta-actins across the species are highly conserved. Our results show that few scattered amino acid changes have caused significant steric hindrance in the binding pocket for mammalian beta-actin, causing a reverse orientation of Aza. These results suggest a model to support the recently observed biological effects caused by Aza in Drosophila cytoskeletal elements and explain why Aza is highly specific to insects than mammals.",2007,"R S Annadurai, R Pravin Kumar, M N Manoj, Anil Kush"
p53 directs focused genomic responses in Drosophila,17310982,10.1038/sj.onc.1210328,"p53 is a fundamental determinant of cancer susceptibility and other age-related pathologies. Similar to mammalian counterparts, Drosophila p53 integrates stress signals and elicits apoptotic responses that maintain genomic stability. To illuminate core-adaptive functions controlled by this gene family, we examined the Drosophila p53 regulatory network at a genomic scale. In development, the absence of p53 impacted constitutive expression for a surprisingly broad scope of genes. By contrast, stimulus-dependent responses governed by Drosophila p53 were limited in scope. The vast majority of stress responders were induced and p53 dependent (RIPD) genes. The signature set of 29 'high stringency' RIPD genes identified here were enriched for intronless loci, with a non-uniform distribution that includes a recently evolved cluster unique to Drosophila melanogaster. Two RIPD genes, with known and unknown biochemical activities, were functionally examined. One RIPD gene, designated XRP1, maintains genome stability after genotoxic challenge and prevents cell proliferation upon induced expression. A second gene, RnrL, is an apoptogenic effector required for caspase activation in a model of p53-dependent killing. Together, these studies identify ancient and convergent features of the p53 regulatory network.",2007,"F Akdemir, J Chapo, J M Abrams, A Christich, N Sogame"
Ethanol interactions with calcium-dependent potassium channels,17850640,10.1111/j.1530-0277.2007.00469.x,"In most neurons and other excitable cells, calcium-activated potassium channels of small (SK) and large conductance (BK; MaxiK) control excitability and neurotransmitter release. The spontaneous activity of dopamine neurons of the ventral tegmental area is increased by ethanol. This ethanol excitation is potentiated by selective blockade of SK, indicating that SK channels modulate ethanol stimulation of neurons that are critical in reward and reinforcement. On the other hand, ethanol directly modulates BK channel activity in a variety of systems, including rat neurohypophysial nerve endings, primary sensory dorsal root ganglia, nucleus accumbens neurons, Caenorhabditis elegans type-IV dopaminergic CEP neurons, and nonneuronal preparations, such as rat pituitary cells, cerebrovascular myocytes and human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Ethanol action on BK channels can modify neuropeptide and growth hormone release, nociception, cerebrovascular tone, and endothelial proliferation. Ethanol modulates BK channels even when the drug is evaluated using recombinant BK channel-forming alpha (slo) subunits or channel reconstitution in artificial, binary lipid bilayers, indicating that the slo subunit and its immediate lipid microenvironment are the essential targets of ethanol. Consistent with this, single amino acid slo channel mutants display altered ethanol sensitivity. Furthermore, C. elegans slo1 null mutants are resistant to ethanol-induced motor incoordination. On the other hand, Drosophila melanogaster slo null mutants fail to acquire acute tolerance to ethanol sedation. Ethanol action on slo channels, however, may be tuned by a variety of factors, including posttranslational modification of slo subunits, coexpression of channel accessory subunits, and the lipid microenvironment, resulting in increase, refractoriness, or even decrease in channel activity. In brief, both SK and BK channels are important targets of ethanol throughout the body, and interference with ethanol effects on these channels could form the basis for novel pharmacotherapies to ameliorate the actions or consequences of alcohol abuse.",2007,"Thomas M Weiger, Andreas Scholz, Mark S Brodie, Alejandro M Dopico"
Differentiation of the Drosophila serotonergic lineage depends on the regulation of Zfh-1 by Notch and Eagle,17702602,10.1016/j.mcn.2007.05.011,"Elucidating mechanisms that differentiate motor neurons from interneurons are fundamental to understanding CNS development. Here we demonstrate that within the Drosophila NB 7-3/serotonergic lineage, different levels of Zfh-1 are required to specify unique properties of both motor neurons and interneurons. We present evidence that Zfh-1 is induced by Notch signaling and suppressed by the transcription factor Eagle. The antagonistic regulation of zfh-1 by Notch and Eagle results in Zfh-1 being expressed at low levels in the NB 7-3 interneurons and at higher levels in the NB 7-3 motor neurons. Furthermore, we present evidence that the induction of Zfh-1 by Notch occurs independently from canonical Notch signaling. We present a model where the differentiation of cell fates within the NB 7-3 lineage requires both canonical and non-canonical Notch signaling. Our observations on the regulation of Zfh-1 provide a new approach for examining the function of Zfh-1 in motor neurons and larval locomotion.",2007,"Martha J Lundell, Hyung-Kook Lee"
ird1 is a Vps15 homologue important for antibacterial immune responses in Drosophila,17166233,10.1111/j.1462-5822.2006.00853.x,"The immune response-deficient 1 (ird1) gene was identified in a forward genetic screen as a novel regulator for the activation of Imd NFkappaB immune signalling pathway in Drosophila. ird1 animals are also more susceptible to Escherichia coli and Micrococcus luteus bacterial infection. ird1 encodes the Drosophila homologue of the Vps15/p150 serine/threonine kinase that regulates a class III phosphoinositide 3-kinase and is necessary for phagosome maturation and starvation-induced autophagy in yeast and mammalian cells. To gain insight into the role of ird1 in the immune response, we examine how amino acid starvation affects the immune signalling pathways in Drosophila. Starvation, in the absence of infection, leads to expression of antimicrobial peptide (AMP) genes and this response is dependent on ird1 and the Imd immune signalling pathway. Starvation, in addition to bacterial infection, suppresses the AMP response in wild-type animals and reduces the ability to survive M. luteus infection. Our results suggest that starvation and innate immune signalling may be intimately linked processes.",2007,"Louisa P Wu, Junlin Wu, Katherine E Randle"
Adaptive gene expression divergence inferred from population genomics,17967066,10.1371/journal.pgen.0030187,"Detailed studies of individual genes have shown that gene expression divergence often results from adaptive evolution of regulatory sequence. Genome-wide analyses, however, have yet to unite patterns of gene expression with polymorphism and divergence to infer population genetic mechanisms underlying expression evolution. Here, we combined genomic expression data--analyzed in a phylogenetic context--with whole genome light-shotgun sequence data from six Drosophila simulans lines and reference sequences from D. melanogaster and D. yakuba. These data allowed us to use molecular population genetics to test for neutral versus adaptive gene expression divergence on a genomic scale. We identified recent and recurrent adaptive evolution along the D. simulans lineage by contrasting sequence polymorphism within D. simulans to divergence from D. melanogaster and D. yakuba. Genes that evolved higher levels of expression in D. simulans have experienced adaptive evolution of the associated 3' flanking and amino acid sequence. Concomitantly, these genes are also decelerating in their rates of protein evolution, which is in agreement with the finding that highly expressed genes evolve slowly. Interestingly, adaptive evolution in 5' cis-regulatory regions did not correspond strongly with expression evolution.

Rapid cold-hardening protects Drosophila melanogaster from cold-induced apoptosis,17245639,10.1007/s10495-006-0048-2,"The rapid cold-hardening (RCH) response increases the cold tolerance of insects by protecting against non-freezing, cold-shock injury. Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, plays important roles in development and the elimination of sub-lethally damaged cells. Our objectives were to determine whether apoptosis plays a role in cold-shock injury and, if so, whether the RCH response protects against cold-induced apoptosis in Drosophila melanogaster. The present study confirmed that RCH increased the cold tolerance of the adults at the organismal level. No flies in the cold-shocked group survived direct exposure to 7 degrees C for 2 h, whereas significantly more flies in the RCH group survived exposure to 7 degrees C for 2 h after a 2-h exposure to 5 degrees C. We used a TUNEL assay to detect and quantify apoptotic cell death in five groups of flies including control, cold-shocked, RCH, heat-shocked (37.5 degrees C, 30 min), and frozen (20 degrees C, 24 h) and found that apoptosis was induced by cold shock, heat shock, and freezing. The RCH treatment significantly improved cell viability by 38% compared to the cold-shocked group. Cold shock-induced DNA fragmentation shown by electrophoresis provided further evidence for apoptosis. SDS-PAGE analysis revealed an RCH-specific protein band with molecular mass of approximately 150 kDa. Western-blotting revealed three proteins that play key roles in the apoptotic pathway: caspase-9-like (apoptotic initiator), caspase-3-like (apoptotic executioner) and Bcl-2 (anti-apoptotic protein). Consequently, the results of this study support the hypothesis that the RCH response protects against cold-shock-induced apoptosis.",2007,"Richard E Lee Jr, Clifford W Moore, Shu-Xia Yi"
"tailup, a LIM-HD gene, and Iro-C cooperate in Drosophila dorsal mesothorax specification",17409113,10.1242/dev.02844,"The LIM-HD gene tailup (tup; also known as islet) has been categorised as a prepattern gene that antagonises the formation of sensory bristles on the notum of Drosophila by downregulating the expression of the proneural achaete-scute genes. Here we show that tup has an earlier function in the development of the imaginal wing disc; namely, the specification of the notum territory. Absence of tup function causes cells of this anlage to upregulate different wing-hinge genes and to lose expression of some notum genes. Consistently, these cells differentiate hinge structures or modified notum cuticle. The LIM-HD co-factors Chip and Ssdp are also necessary for notum specification. This suggests that Tup acts in this process in a complex with Chip and Ssdp. Overexpression of tup, together with araucan, a 'pronotum' gene of the iroquois complex (Iro-C), synergistically reinforces the weak capacity of either gene, when overexpressed singly, to induce ectopic notum-like development. Whereas the Iro-C genes are activated in the notum anlage by EGFR signalling, tup is positively regulated by Dpp signalling. Our data support a model in which the EGFR and Dpp signalling pathways, with their respective downstream Iro-C and tup genes, converge and cooperate to commit cells to the notum developmental fate.",2007,"Juan Modolell, Joaquín de Navascués"

Shared principles include the need for positive feedback involving fate-determining genes to maintain a differentiated state, and the existence of intra- or extracellular inhibitory signals that improve spatial resolution of neighboring territories. The precision of spatial segregation is, however, limited by stochastic gene expression. Variability in gene expression at territory boundaries might give rise to a poorly differentiated pool of cells, which could harbor stem-like properties. The ideas outlined here deserve further theoretical and experimental exploration.",2007,"Reiner A Veitia, Isaac Salazar-Ciudad"
"Drosophila DEG/ENaC pickpocket genes are expressed in the tracheal system, where they may be involved in liquid clearance",12571352,10.1073/pnas.252785099,"The Drosophila tracheal system and mammalian airways are branching networks of tubular epithelia that deliver oxygen to the organism. In mammals, the epithelial Na(+) channel (ENaC) helps clear liquid from airways at the time of birth and removes liquid from the airspaces in adults. We tested the hypothesis that related Drosophila degenerin (DEG)/ENaC family members might play a similar role in the fly. Among 16 Drosophila DEG/ENaC genes, called pickpocket (PPK) genes, we found 9 expressed in the tracheal system. By in situ hybridization, expression appeared in late-stage embryos after tracheal tube formation, with individual PPK genes showing distinct temporal and spatial expression patterns as development progressed. Promoters for several PPK genes drove reporter gene expression in the larval and adult tracheal systems. Adding the DEG/ENaC channel blocker amiloride to the medium inhibited liquid clearance from the trachea of first instar larvae. Moreover, when RNA interference was used to silence PPK4 and PPK11, larvae failed to clear tracheal liquid. These data suggest substantial molecular diversity of DEG/ENaC channel expression in the Drosophila tracheal system where the PPK proteins likely play a role in Na(+) absorption. Extensive similarities between Drosophila and mammalian airways offer opportunities for genetic studies that may decipher further the structure and function of DEG/ENaC proteins and development of the airways.",2003,"Lei Liu, Michael J Welsh, Wayne A Johnson"

An evolutionary analysis of orphan genes in Drosophila,14525923,10.1101/gr.1311003,"Orphan genes are protein-coding regions that have no recognizable homolog in distantly related species. A substantial fraction of coding regions in any genome sequenced consists of orphan genes, but the evolutionary and functional significance of orphan genes is not understood. We present a reanalysis of the Drosophila melanogaster proteome that shows that there are still between 26% and 29% of all proteins without a significant match with noninsect sequences, and that these orphans are underrepresented in genetic screens. To analyze the characteristics of orphan genes in Drosophila, we used sequence comparisons between cDNAs retrieved from two Drosophila yakuba libraries and their corresponding D. melanogaster orthologs. We find that a cDNA library from adults yields twice as many orphan genes as such a library from embryos. The orphan genes evolve on average more than three times faster than nonorphan genes, although the width of the evolutionary rate distribution is similar for the two classes. In particular, some orphan genes show very low substitution rates that are comparable to otherwise highly conserved genes. We propose a model suggesting that orphans may be involved in the evolution of adaptive traits, and that slow-evolving orphan genes may be particularly interesting candidate genes for identifying lineage-specific adaptations.",2003,"Tomislav Domazet-Loso, Diethard Tautz"

Genetic dissection of hybrid incompatibilities between Drosophila simulans and D. mauritiana. I. Differential accumulation of hybrid male sterility effects on the X and autosomes,12930747,,"The genetic basis of hybrid incompatibility in crosses between Drosophila mauritiana and D. simulans was investigated to gain insight into the evolutionary mechanisms of speciation. In this study, segments of the D. mauritiana third chromosome were introgressed into a D. simulans genetic background and tested as homozygotes for viability, male fertility, and female fertility. The entire third chromosome was covered with partially overlapping segments. Many segments were male sterile, while none were female sterile or lethal, confirming previous reports of the rapid evolution of hybrid male sterility (HMS). A statistical model was developed to quantify the HMS accumulation. In comparison with previous work on the X chromosome, we estimate that the X has approximately 2.5 times the density of HMS factors as the autosomes. We also estimate that the whole genome contains approximately 15 HMS ""equivalents""-i.e., 15 times the minimum number of incompatibility factors necessary to cause complete sterility. Although some caveats for the quantitative estimate of a 2.5-fold density difference are described, this study supports the notion that the X chromosome plays a special role in the evolution of reproductive isolation. Possible mechanisms of a ""large X"" effect include selective fixation of new mutations that are recessive or partially recessive and the evolution of sex-ratio distortion systems.",2003,"Cathy C Laurie, Daniel L Hartl, Yun Tao, Sining Chen"
Heterogeneity in residual function of MeCP2 carrying missense mutations in the methyl CpG binding domain,12843318,10.1136/jmg.40.7.487,"Rett syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder with severe mental retardation caused by mutations in the MECP2 gene. Mutations in the MECP2 gene are also associated with other genetic disorders, including X linked mental retardation in males. Missense mutations identified so far are present primarily in the methyl CpG binding domain (MBD) of MECP2. Here, the functional significance of 28 MBD missense mutations identified in patients were analysed by transient expression of the mutant proteins in cultured cells. The effects of mutations were evaluated by analysis of the affinity of MeCP2 to pericentromeric heterochromatin in mouse L929 cells and on transcriptional repressive activity of MeCP2 in Drosophila SL2 cells. These analyses showed that approximately one-third (9/28) of MBD missense mutations showed strong impairment of MeCP2 function. The mutation of the R111 residue, which directly interacts with the methyl group of methyl cytosine, completely abolished MeCP2 function and mutations affecting beta-sheets and a hairpin loop have substantial functional consequences. In contrast, mutations that showed marginal or mild impairment of the function fell in unstructured regions with no DNA interaction.

The origin of dorsoventral polarity in Drosophila,14511478,10.1098/rstb.2003.1325,"In Drosophila dorsoventral (DV) polarity arises during oogenesis when the oocyte nucleus moves from a central posterior to an asymmetrical anterior position. Nuclear movement is a symmetry-breaking step and establishes orthogonality between the anteroposterior and the DV axes. The asymmetrically anchored nucleus defines a cortical region within the oocyte which accumulates high levels of gurken messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein. Gurken is an ovarian-specific member of the transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha) family of secreted ligands. Secreted Gurken forms a concentration gradient that results in a dorsal-to-ventral gradient of EGF receptor activation in the follicle cells surrounding the oocyte. This leads to concentration-dependent activation or repression of target genes of the EGF pathway in the follicular epithelium. One outcome of this process is the restriction of pipe expression to a ventral domain that comprises 40% of the egg circumference. Pipe presumably modifies extracellular matrix components that are secreted by the follicle cells and are present at the ventral side of embryo after egg deposition. Here, they activate a proteolytic cascade that generates a gradient of the diffusible ligand, Spätzle. Spätzle activates the Toll receptor at the surface of the embryo that stimulates the nuclear uptake of the transcription factor Dorsal. This leads to a nuclear concentration gradient of Dorsal that specifies the cell types along the DV axis of the embryo.",2003,Siegfried Roth
A Notch/Delta-dependent relay mechanism establishes anterior-posterior polarity in Drosophila,14536057,10.1016/s1534-5807(03)00272-7,"The anterior-posterior axis of Drosophila becomes polarized early in oogenesis, when the oocyte moves to the posterior of the germline cyst because it preferentially adheres to posterior follicle cells. The source of this asymmetry is unclear, however, since anterior and posterior follicle cells are equivalent until midoogenesis, when Gurken signaling from the oocyte induces posterior fate. Here, we show that asymmetry arises because each cyst polarizes the next cyst through a series of posterior to anterior inductions. Delta signaling from the older cyst induces the anterior polar follicle cells, the anterior polar cells signal through the JAK/STAT pathway to induce the formation of the stalk between adjacent cysts, and the stalk polarizes the younger anterior cyst by inducing the shape change and preferential adhesion that position the oocyte at the posterior. The anterior-posterior axis is therefore established by a relay mechanism, which propagates polarity from one cyst to the next.",2003,"Hernán López-Schier, Daniel St Johnston, Isabel L Torres"

To identify cDNAs encoding particular venom proteins, N-terminal amino acid sequences were determined for large (>30 kDa) venom proteins that had been separated using a combination of gel filtration and SDS-PAGE. We describe five of these cDNAs, which encoded residues that matched with the N-terminal sequences of previously undescribed venom proteins. cDNAs vpr1 and vpr3 encoded related proteins of approximately 32 kDa that were found in widely different fractions of gel filtration-separated venom. Neither vpr1 nor vpr3 were closely related to any other protein in the GenBank database, suggesting that they are highly specialised venom components. vpr2 encoded a 57-kDa polypeptide that was similar to a Drosophila protein, of unknown function, which lacks a signal sequence. A fourth clone, tre1, encoded a 61-kDa protein with extensive sequence similarity to trehalases.

In this study, we have characterized the second eIF2alpha kinase found in Drosophila, a PERK homologue (DPERK). Expression of DPERK is developmentally regulated. During embryogenesis, DPERK expression becomes concentrated in the endodermal cells of the gut and in the germ line precursor cells.

Kinase activity assays with these DPERK deletion mutants suggested that DPERK localization facilitates its in vivo function. Similar to mammalian PERK, DPERK forms oligomers in vivo and DPERK activity appears to be regulated by ER stress.

In the present study, we cloned an intracellular domain segment of human kidney NaDC-3, which is 75% identical to that of the rat, constructed a polyclonal antibody against fusion protein of glutathione S-transferase (GST)-NaDC-3, and detected its renal expression changes with aging in both Wistar rats and normal humans. Western blot and immunohistochemistry confirmed the specificity of the antibody, and its location was found to be on the basolateral membrane of the renal proximal tubule. In addition, Western and Northern blots showed that NaDC-3 in kidneys significantly increased with age in Wistar rats. In healthy humans, renal NaDC-3 abundance also increased with age. Our results demonstrated that NaDC-3 expression was increased in aged Wistar rats and aged people, indicating that NaDC-3 may have a role in the process of kidney aging.",2003,"Jianzhong Wang, Xiangmei Chen, Hanyu Zhu, Quan Hong, Lixia Peng"
A RhoGEF and Rho family GTPase-activating protein complex links the contractile ring to cortical microtubules at the onset of cytokinesis,12530961,10.1016/s1534-5807(02)00402-1,"The mechanism that positions the cytokinetic contractile ring is unknown, but derives from the spindle midzone. We show that an interaction between the Rho GTP exchange factor, Pebble, and the Rho family GTPase-activating protein, RacGAP50C, connects the contractile ring to cortical microtubules at the site of furrowing in D. melanogaster cells. Pebble regulates actomyosin organization, while RacGAP50C and its binding partner, the Pavarotti kinesin-like protein, regulate microtubule bundling. All three factors are required for cytokinesis. As furrowing begins, these proteins colocalize to a cortical equatorial ring. We propose that RacGAP50C-Pavarotti complexes travel on cortical microtubules to the cell equator, where they associate with the Pebble RhoGEF to position contractile ring formation and coordinate F-actin and microtubule remodeling during cytokinesis.",2003,"W Gregory Somers, Robert Saint"
A cluster of proton/amino acid transporter genes in the human and mouse genomes,12809675,10.1016/s0888-7543(03)00099-5,"We recently cloned and functionally characterized two novel proton/amino acid transporters (PAT1 and PAT2) from mouse.

The PAT proteins comprise 470 to 483 amino acids. The mouse PAT3 mRNA is expressed in testis of adult mice. In the human and mouse genomes the genes of the PAT transporters (designated SLC36A1-3 and Slc36a1-3, respectively) are clustered on human chromosome 5q33.1 and in the syntenic region of mouse chromosome 11B1.3. PAT-like transporter genes are present as well in the genomes of other eukaryotic organisms such as Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans.

Crystal structures of engrailed homeodomain mutants: implications for stability and dynamics,12923178,10.1074/jbc.M308029200,"We report the crystal structures and biophysical characterization of two stabilized mutants of the Drosophila Engrailed homeodomain that have been engineered to minimize electrostatic repulsion. Four independent copies of each mutant occupy the crystal lattice, and comparison of these structures illustrates variation that can be partly ascribed to networks of correlated conformational adjustments. Central to one network is leucine 26 (Leu26), which occupies alternatively two side chain rotameric conformations (-gauche and trans) and different positions within the hydrophobic core. Similar sets of conformational substates are observed in other Engrailed structures and in another homeodomain. The pattern of structural adjustments can account for NMR relaxation data and sequence co-variation networks in the wider homeodomain family. It may also explain the dysfunction associated with a P26L mutation in the human ARX homeodomain protein. Finally, we observe a novel dipolar interaction between a conserved tryptophan and a water molecule positioned along the normal to the indole ring. This interaction may explain the distinctive fluorescent properties of the homeodomain family.",2003,"Luca Federici, Ugo Mayor, Ben F Luisi, Stefan M V Freund, Elliott J Stollar, Simon C Lovell, Alan R Fersht"
TRPs make sense,12647029,10.1007/s00232-002-1059-8,"Drosophila flies with the trp mutation exhibit impaired vision due to the lack of a specific Ca2+ influx pathway in the photoreceptors. The identification of the trp gene product as a Ca2+-permeable ion channel and the search for TRP homologues in flies, worms and mammals has opened the way to the discovery of a whole superfamily of cation channels, baptized TRP channels. In contrast to voltage-gated K+, Na+, or Ca2+ channels, with whom they share their transmembrane architecture, TRP channels are not activated by voltage but by a variety of signals including intra- and extracellular ligands, Ca2+-store depletion and mechanical or thermal stress. Due to the promiscuity of these gating mechanisms, TRP channels are privileged candidates as primary sensing molecules for the recognition and integration of physical and chemical signals from the environment. In this review we discuss recent evidence that implicates members of the TRP superfamily in sensory signal transduction.",2003,"T Voets, B Nilius"
Telomeric transgenes and trans-silencing in Drosophila,12723712,10.1023/a:1022929121828,"Autonomous P elements, inserted in heterochromatic telomeric associated sequences (TAS) at the X chromosome telomere (site 1A) have strong P element regulatory properties that include repression of P-induced hybrid-dysgenesis and of P-lacZ expression in the germline. P-lacZ insertions or defective P elements at 1A in TAS can also repress in trans a euchromatic P-lacZ in the germline. This property has been called a trans-silencing effect (TSE). It requires some sequence-homology between the telomeric insertion and the euchromatic transgene. When repression is partial, variegating lacZ expression is observed, suggesting a chromatin-based component. TSE is observed only when the silencer transgenes are maternally inherited and occurs only in the female germline. We have evidence that this silencing also works in the presence of homologous non-P element sequences suggesting that homology-dependent silencing could be a general phenomenon in the female germline; such a system might have been subsequently adopted by the P element family, allowing its own repression.",2003,"Stéphane Ronsseray, Thibaut Josse, Antoine Boivin, Dominique Anxolabéhère"
The Hox gene Ultrabithorax modulates the shape and size of the third leg of Drosophila by influencing diverse mechanisms,12679108,10.1016/s0012-1606(03)00035-6,"The developmental mechanisms that regulate the relative size and shape of organs have remained obscure despite almost a century of interest in the problem and the fact that changes in relative size represent the dominant mode of evolutionary change. Here, I investigate how the Hox gene Ultrabithorax (Ubx) instructs the legs on the third thoracic segment of Drosophila melanogaster to develop with a different size and shape from the legs on the second thoracic segment. Through loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments, I demonstrate that different segments of the leg, the femur and the first tarsal segment, and even different regions of the femur, regulate their size in response to Ubx expression through qualitatively different mechanisms. In some regions, Ubx acts autonomously to specify shape and size, whereas in other regions, Ubx influences size through nonautonomous mechanisms. Loss of Ubx autonomously reduces cell size in the T3 femur, but this reduction seems to be partially compensated by an increase in cell numbers, so that it is unclear what effect cell size and number directly have on femur size. Loss of Ubx has both autonomous and nonautonomous effects on cell number in different regions of the basitarsus, but again there is not a strong correlation between cell size or number and organ size. Total organ size appears to be regulated through mechanisms that operate at the level of the entire leg segment (femur or basitarsus) relatively independently of the behavior of individual subpopulations of cells within the segment.",2003,David L Stern

For chromosome end elongation the majority of eukaryotes use a specialized reverse transcriptase, telomerase, which adds a short, tandemly repeated DNA sequence motif to chromosome ends. Chromosome elongation can also be achieved, however, by mechanisms other than telomerase. Such elongation events have been detected under conditions where telomerase has been inactivated experimentally and in the few organisms that naturally lack telomerase. We will summarize current knowledge on these telomerase-independent elongation mechanisms in yeast and mammalian cells and will discuss in more detail the telomere elongation mechanism by retrotransposons in Drosophila melanogaster.",2003,"J M Mason, H Biessmann"
Serine proteases and their homologs in the Drosophila melanogaster genome: an initial analysis of sequence conservation and phylogenetic relationships,12568721,10.1016/s0378-1119(02)01187-3,"Serine proteases (SPs) and serine protease homologs (SPHs) constitute the second largest family of genes in the Drosophila melanogaster genome. Eighty-four SPs comprise less than 300 amino acid residues, and a significant portion of them are probably digestive enzymes. Some larger SPs may contain one or more regions important for protein-protein interactions, including clip domains, low-density lipoprotein receptor class A repeats, and scavenger receptor cysteine-rich domains. We identified 37 clusters of SP or SPH genes, which probably evolved from relatively recent gene duplication and sequence divergence. A majority of the SPs may be trypsin-like and activated by cleavage after a specific arginine or lysine residue. Among the 147 SPs and 57 SPHs studied, 24 SPs and 13 SPHs contain at least one regulatory clip domain. A multiple sequence alignment of the clip domains provided further information on structural conservation of these regulatory modules. Detailed sequence comparison led to an improved classification system for SPs containing clip domains. These analyses have established a framework of information about evolutionary relationships among the Drosophila SPs and SPHs, which may facilitate research on these proteins as well as homologous molecules from other invertebrate species.",2003,"Jeremy Ross, Yang Wang, Michael R Kanost, Haobo Jiang"
In vitro identification of two adherence factors required for in vivo virulence of Pseudomonas fluorescens,14623013,10.1016/j.micinf.2003.09.002,"By enriching a random transposon insertion bank of Pseudomonas fluorescens for mutants affected in their adherence to the human extracellular matrix protein fibronectin, we isolated 23 adherence minus mutants. Mutants showed a defect in their ability to develop a biofilm on an abiotic surface and were impaired for virulence when tested in an in vivo virulence model in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Molecular characterisation of these mutants showed that the transposon insertions localised to two distinct chromosomal locations, which were subsequently cloned and characterised from two mutants. A search in the databanks identified two loci in the Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 genome with significant homology to the genes interrupted by the transposon insertions. Mutant IVC6 shows homology to gmd, coding for the enzyme GDP-mannose dehydratase, involved in the synthesis of A-band- O-antigen-containing lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Mutant IVG7 is significantly similar to a probable outer membrane protein of strain PAO1, with no specific function attributed thus far, yet with significant homology to Escherichia coli FadL, involved in long-chain fatty acid transport. We propose that this protein, together with LPS, is involved in the first steps of P. fluorescens adherence leading to host colonisation. Results presented here also demonstrate the pathogenic potential of P. fluorescens, assessed in an in vivo Drosophila model system, correlated with its ability to adhere to the human extracellular matrix protein, fibronectin. Correlation between the mutant phenotypes with identified virulence factors and their actual role in the virulence of P. fluorescens is discussed.",2003,"Emmanuel Le Bouder, Christian Hulen, Patrick Di Martino, Andréa de Lima Pimenta, Mark A Blight"
[Genetic control of cardiac tube formation in Drosophila],12910631,,"In Drosophila, the heart is composed of a simple linear tube constituted of 52 pairs of myoendothelial cells which differentiate during embryogenesis to build up a functional mature organ. The cardiac tube is a contractile organ with autonomous muscular activity which functions as a hemolymph pump in an open circulatory circuit. The cardiac tube is organized in metamers which contain six pairs of cardioblasts per segment. Within each metamer the cardioblasts express a combination of genetic markers underlying their functional diversity. For example, the two most posterior cardiac cells in segments A5 to A7 differentiate into ostiae which allow the inflow of hemolymph in the tube. An additional axial information along the anteroposterior axis orchestrates the subdivision of the cardiac tube into an ""aorta"" in the anterior region and a ""heart"" in the posterior region which behave as distinct functional entities. The major pacemaker activity is located in the most caudal part of the heart. This analysis has being made possible by the identification and the utilization of specific morphological and genetic markers and an in vivo observation of cardiac function in the embryo. Functional organogenesis of the cardiac tube is accurately controlled by genetic programs that have been in part identified. Hox genes are responsible for the axial subdivision of the tube into functional modules. They activate, in their specific domains of expression, target genes effectors of the terminal differentiation. On the other hand, part of the information required for segmental information is provided by Hedgehog, a morphogen secreted by dorsal ectoderm, whose activity triggers the ostiae formation in the heart domain.",2003,"Laurent Perrin, Martine Astier, Romina Ponzielli, Michel Sémériva"
Transcriptional regulation of the insulin signaling pathway genes by starvation and 20-hydroxyecdysone in the Bombyx fat body,20197069,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2010.02.011,"Genetic studies in the fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster, have uncovered a conserved insulin/insulin growth factor signaling (IIS) pathway that regulates nutrition-dependent growth rates of insects. From the silkworm, Bombyx mori, we have identified and characterized several key genes involved in the IIS pathway, including InR, IRS, PI3K110, PI3K60, PTEN, PDK, and Akt. Tissue distribution analysis showed that most of these genes were highly expressed in the fat body implying that the IIS pathway is functionally important within insect adipose tissue. Developmental profile studies revealed that the expression levels of InR, IRS, PI3K110, and PDK were elevated in the fat body during molting and pupation, periods when animals ceased feeding and hemolymph levels of 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) were high. Starvation rapidly up-regulated the mRNA levels of these same genes in the fat body, while 20E slowly induced their transcription. We conclude that 20E slowly reduces food consumption and then indirectly induces a state of starvation resulting in the elevation of the mRNA levels of InR, IRS, PI3K110, and PDK in the Bombyx fat body during molting and pupation.",2010,"Zhentao Sheng, Li Ma, Shun Zhou, Ling Tian, William G Bendena, Yan Liu, Sheng Wang, Rong-Jing Jiang, Sheng Li"
"Identification of a gene, Desiccate, contributing to desiccation resistance in Drosophila melanogaster",20937803,10.1074/jbc.M110.168864,"Suitable alterations in gene expression are believed to allow animals to survive drastic changes in environmental conditions. Drosophila melanogaster larvae cease eating and exit moist food to search for dry pupation sites after the foraging stage in what is known as the wandering stage. Although the behavioral change from foraging to wandering causes desiccation stress, the mechanism by which Drosophila larvae protect themselves from desiccation remains obscure. Here, we identified a gene, CG14686 (designated as Desiccate (Desi)), whose expression was elevated during the wandering stage. The Desi expression level was reversibly decreased by transferring wandering larvae to wet conditions and increased again by transferring them to dry conditions. Elevation of Desi expression was also observed in foraging larvae when they were placed in dry conditions. Desi encoded a 261-amino acid single-pass transmembrane protein with notable motifs, such as SH2 and PDZ domain-binding motifs and a cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation motif, in the cytoplasmic region, and its expression was observed mainly in the epidermal cells of the larval integuments. Overexpression of Desi slightly increased the larval resistance to desiccation stress during the second instar. Furthermore, Desi RNAi larvae lost more weight under dry conditions, and subsequently, their mortalities significantly increased compared with control larvae. Under dry conditions, consumption of carbohydrate was much higher in Desi RNAi larvae than control larvae. Based on these results, it is reasonable to conclude that Desi contributes to the resistance of Drosophila larvae to desiccation stress.",2010,"Masasuke Ryuda, Yoichi Hayakawa, Hitoshi Matsumoto, Seiji Tsuzuki, Takeshi Kawano, Masami Shimoda"
Three selections are better than one: clinal variation of thermal QTL from independent selection experiments in Drosophila,20497214,10.1111/j.1558-5646.2010.01039.x,"We report the results of two independent selection experiments that have exposed distinct populations of Drosophila melanogaster to different forms of thermal selection. A recombinant population derived from Arvin California and Zimbabwe isofemale lines was exposed to laboratory natural selection at two temperatures (T(AZ): 18°C and 28°C). Microsatellite mapping identified quantitative trait loci (QTL) on the X-chromosome between the replicate ""Hot"" and ""Cold"" populations. In a separate experiment, disruptive selection was imposed on an outbred California population for the ""knockdown"" temperature (T(KD)) in a thermal column. Microsatellite mapping of the ""High"" and ""Low"" populations also uncovered primarily X-linked QTL. Notably, a marker in the shaggy locus at band 3A was significantly differentiated in both experiments. Finer scale mapping of the 3A region has narrowed the QTL to the shaggy gene region, which contains several candidate genes that function in circadian rhythms. The same allele that was increased in frequency in the High T(KD) populations is significantly clinal in North America and is more common at the warm end of the cline (Florida vs. Maine; however, the cline was not apparent in Australia). Together, these studies show that independent selection experiments can uncover the same target of selection and that evolution in the laboratory can recapitulate putatively adaptive clinal variation in nature.",2010,"Daniel Lerman, Donna Folk, George W Gilchrist, Daniel M Weinreich, David M Rand"
"Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate directs spermatid cell polarity and exocyst localization in Drosophila",20237161,10.1091/mbc.e09-07-0582,"During spermiogenesis, Drosophila melanogaster spermatids coordinate their elongation in interconnected cysts that become highly polarized, with nuclei localizing to one end and sperm tail growth occurring at the other. Remarkably little is known about the signals that drive spermatid polarity and elongation. Here we identify phosphoinositides as critical regulators of these processes. Reduction of plasma membrane phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP(2)) by low-level expression of the PIP(2) phosphatase SigD or mutation of the PIP(2) biosynthetic enzyme Skittles (Sktl) results in dramatic defects in spermatid cysts, which become bipolar and fail to fully elongate. Defects in polarity are evident from the earliest stages of elongation, indicating that phosphoinositides are required for establishment of polarity. Sktl and PIP(2) localize to the growing end of the cysts together with the exocyst complex. Strikingly, the exocyst becomes completely delocalized when PIP(2) levels are reduced, and overexpression of Sktl restores exocyst localization and spermatid cyst polarity. Moreover, the exocyst is required for polarity, as partial loss of function of the exocyst subunit Sec8 results in bipolar cysts. Our data are consistent with a mechanism in which localized synthesis of PIP(2) recruits the exocyst to promote targeted membrane delivery and polarization of the elongating cysts.",2010,"Gordon Polevoy, Janet Rollins, Julie A Brill, Ho-Chun Wei, Lacramioara Fabian, Tatsuhiko Noguchi, Kishan Bellamkonda, Louis Gervais, Margaret T Fuller, J Todd Blankenship, Antoine Guichet"

To test this idea, we examined contigs assembled from published small RNA libraries and discovered five previously undescribed viruses from cultured Drosophila cells and adult mosquitoes, including three with a positive-strand RNA genome and two with a dsRNA genome. Notably, four of the identified viruses exhibited only low sequence similarities to known viruses, such that none could be assigned into an existing virus genus. We also report detection of virus-derived PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) in Drosophila melanogaster that have not been previously described in any other host species and demonstrate viral genome assembly from viral piRNAs in the absence of viral siRNAs. Thus, this study provides a powerful culture-independent approach for virus discovery in invertebrates by assembling viral genomes directly from host immune response products without prior virus enrichment or amplification.

Furthermore MAP4K3 mutants display phenotypes characteristic of low TORC1 activity and low nutrient availability, such as reduced growth rate, small body size, and low lipid reserves. The differences between control and MAP4K3 mutant animals diminish when animals are reared in low-nutrient conditions, suggesting that the ability of TOR to sense amino acids is most important when nutrients are abundant.

However, their role in antifungal peptides (AFPs) has not been extensively evaluated. To address this question, we investigated the functional role of charged residues in drosomycin, a specific Drosophila antifungal peptide, using site-directed mutagenesis in combination with circular dichroism (CD) analysis and antifungal assays. As a result, we firstly identified five cationic residues (R6, K8, R20, R21 and K38) whose alterations significantly affected the antifungal activity. Intriguingly, two negatively charged residues (D1 and E25) are also recognized as functional determinants of drosomycin. This indicates that it is the location of these charged residues rather than net charges that is crucial for activity. These functional sites are located in different secondary structure elements, including the N-loop, alpha-helix and gamma-core regions, all highly exposed on the molecular surface, suggesting that drosomycin may bind to fungal targets through electrostatic interactions.

Here we provide evidence that Gprk2 promotes high-level Hh signaling by regulating Smoothened (Smo) conformation through both kinase-dependent and kinase-independent mechanisms. Gprk2 promotes Smo activation by phosphorylating Smo C-terminal tail (C-tail) at Ser741/Thr742, which is facilitated by PKA and CK1 phosphorylation at adjacent Ser residues. In addition, Gprk2 forms a dimer/oligomer and binds Smo C-tail in a kinase activity-independent manner to stabilize the active Smo conformation, and promotes dimerization/oligomerization of Smo C-tail. Gprk2 expression is induced by Hh signaling, and Gprk2/Smo interaction is facilitated by PKA/CK1-mediated phosphorylation of Smo C-tail. Thus, Gprk2 forms a positive feedback loop and acts downstream from PKA and CK1 to facilitate high-level Hh signaling by promoting the active state of Smo through direct phosphorylation and molecular scaffolding.",2010,"Jin Jiang, Yongbin Chen, Yun Zhao, Shuang Li, Yajuan Liu, Jianhang Jia, Bing Wang, Chao Tong"
Binding site turnover produces pervasive quantitative changes in transcription factor binding between closely related Drosophila species,20351773,10.1371/journal.pbio.1000343,"Changes in gene expression play an important role in evolution, yet the molecular mechanisms underlying regulatory evolution are poorly understood. Here we compare genome-wide binding of the six transcription factors that initiate segmentation along the anterior-posterior axis in embryos of two closely related species: Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila yakuba. Where we observe binding by a factor in one species, we almost always observe binding by that factor to the orthologous sequence in the other species. Levels of binding, however, vary considerably. The magnitude and direction of the interspecies differences in binding levels of all six factors are strongly correlated, suggesting a role for chromatin or other factor-independent forces in mediating the divergence of transcription factor binding. Nonetheless, factor-specific quantitative variation in binding is common, and we show that it is driven to a large extent by the gain and loss of cognate recognition sequences for the given factor. We find only a weak correlation between binding variation and regulatory function. These data provide the first genome-wide picture of how modest levels of sequence divergence between highly morphologically similar species affect a system of coordinately acting transcription factors during animal development, and highlight the dominant role of quantitative variation in transcription factor binding over short evolutionary distances.",2010,"Xiao-Yong Li, Stuart Davidson, Leath A Tonkin, Robert K Bradley, Michael B Eisen, Hou Cheng Chu, Mark D Biggin, Lior Pachter, Cole Trapnell"
Vectors and parameters that enhance the efficacy of RNAi-mediated gene disruption in transgenic Drosophila,20534445,10.1073/pnas.1006689107,"Whole-genome transgenic RNAi libraries permit systematic genetic screens in individual tissues of Drosophila.

To minimize such effects, it is essential to obtain a deeper understanding of the specificity of action of RNAi. Here, in vivo assays are used to determine the minimum, contiguous nucleotide pairing required between an siRNA and a target mRNA to generate a phenotype. We observe that as few as 16 nucleotides of contiguous homology are sufficient to attenuate gene activity. This finding provides an explanation for the high incidence of off-target effects observed in RNAi-based genetic screens. Toward improving the efficacy of RNAi-induced phenotypes in vivo, we describe siRNA expression vectors that allow coexpression of one or more siRNAs with a fluorescent reporter gene in cultured cells or transgenic flies.

A critical role of SNF1A/dAMPKalpha (Drosophila AMP-activated protein kinase alpha) in muscle on longevity and stress resistance in Drosophila melanogaster,20184862,10.1016/j.bbrc.2010.02.126,"Energy homeostasis and stress resistance are closely linked on aging and longevity. AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) is a sensor of cellular energy status activated by metabolic stress that accelerates AMP/ATP ratio, regulating cell polarity, metabolic homeostasis and sensitivity to stress resistance. AMPK could be therapeutic targets for cancer, diabetic mellitus and obesity, providing a possible link to metabolic syndrome. However, little is known how functional deficiency of AMPK affects longevity and stress resistance in vivo due to its redundancy and lethality in null-mutant. SNF1A/dAMPKalpha (CG3051) is a single orthologue for its mammalian counterparts in Drosophila melanogaster. Using time- and tissue-specific RNAi system in D. melanogaster, we found that adult-onset inhibition of dAMPKalpha especially in muscle shortens lifespan. In addition, inhibition of dAMPKalpha in muscle enhances sensitivity to paraquat and starvation stress. Real-time PCR analysis showed that inhibition of dAMPKalpha in muscle affected the transcriptional regulation of various genes in response to starvation.

"Drosophila melanogaster Dis3 N-terminal domains are required for ribonuclease activities, nuclear localization and exosome interactions",20421210,10.1093/nar/gkq295,"Eukaryotic cells use numerous pathways to regulate RNA production, localization and stability. Several of these pathways are controlled by ribonucleases. The essential ribonuclease, Dis3, plays important roles in distinct RNA metabolic pathways. Despite much progress in understanding general characteristics of the Dis3 enzyme in vitro and in vivo, much less is known about the contributions of Dis3 domains to its activities, subcellular localization and protein-protein interactions. To address these gaps, we constructed a set of Drosophila melanogaster Dis3 (dDis3) mutants and assessed their enzymatic activity in vitro and their localizations and interactions in S2 tissue culture cells. We show that the dDis3 N-terminus is sufficient for endoribonuclease activity in vitro and that proper N-terminal domain structure is critical for activity of the full-length polypeptide. We find that the dDis3 N-terminus also contributes to its subcellular distribution, and is necessary and sufficient for interactions with core exosome proteins. Finally, dDis3 interaction with dRrp6 and dImportin-α3 is independent of core interactions and occurs though two different regions. Taken together, our data suggest that the dDis3 N-terminus is a dynamic and complex hub for RNA metabolism and exosome interactions.",2010,"Alexandra Smith, Erik D Andrulis, Megan Mamolen"
"The Anaphase Promoting Complex activator CCS52A, a key factor for fruit growth and endoreduplication in Tomato",20671429,10.4161/psb.5.8.12222,"Tomato fruit growth is characterized by the occurrence of numerous rounds of DNA endoreduplication in connection to cell expansion and final fruit size determination. Endoreduplication occurs as an impairment of mitosis, which can originate from the selective degradation of M-phase-specific cyclins via the ubiquitin-mediated proteolytic pathway, requiring the E3 ubiquitin ligase Anaphase Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C). In plants CCS52A is the ortholog of CDH1/FZR proteins from yeast, drosophila and human, belonging to the WD40-repeat protein family. During fruit development, the SlCCS52A gene expression is specifically associated to endoreduplication in tomato. Altering SlCCS52A expression in either negative or positive manner impacts the extent of endoreduplication in fruit and affects fruit size. When SlCCS52A is down-expressed endoreduplication is impaired during fruit growth leading to reduced fruit growth. However when SlCCS52A is over-expressed, endoreduplication is initially delayed, accounting for the altered final fruit size, but resumes and is even enhanced leading to fruit growth recovery, pointing at the physiological role of endoreduplication in growth induction during tomato fruit development.",2010,"Catherine Cheniclet, Michel Hernould, Frédéric Gévaudant, Christian Chevalier, Elodie Mathieu-Rivet"
"A preliminary assessment of singlet oxygen scavenging, cytotoxic and genotoxic properties of Geranium macrorrhizum extracts",20454706,,"Strong radical-scavenging activity of Geranium macrorrhizum extracts isolated by using various solvent systems has been reported previously. This study aimed at expanding the knowledge on the bioactivities of antioxidatively active G. macrorrhizum butanol fraction, which was isolated from ethanolic extract (EB), and water fraction, which was isolated from water extract (WW) by measuring their singlet oxygen scavenging properties, as well as preliminary assessment of cytotoxicity and genotoxicity toward mammalian cells. The cytotoxicity (necrosis induction) of the extracts in bovine leukemia virus-transformed lamb kidney fibroblasts (line FLK) was partly prevented by antioxidants and stimulated by the prooxidant BCNU (N,N'-bis(2-chloroethyl)-N-nitrosourea). This indicates that the cytotoxicity of G. macrorrhizum extracts is at least partly attributed to their prooxidant action, presumably due to the formation of quinoidal products of their (auto)oxidation. The latter was evidenced by the nature of the peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation products, which supported DT-diaphorase-catalyzed oxidation of NADPH and participated in conjugation reactions with reduced glutathione. The genotoxic properties were studied using chromosome aberration (CA) and sister chromatid exchange (SCE) tests in human lymphocytes in vitro and Drosophila melanogaster somatic mutation and recombination test (SMART) in vivo. In the CA test, only the highest doses of both fractions significantly increased chromosome aberration frequency. In the SCE test, both fractions induced SCEs in a clear dose-dependent manner. G. macrorrhizum extracts were not genotoxic in the SMART test in vivo. Our data indicate that in spite of the possible beneficial (antioxidant) effects of Geranium extracts, the possibilities of their use as ingredients of functional foods and/or food supplements should be further examined due to their cyto- and genotoxic effects resulting mainly from the action of quercetin-derived components abundant in the extracts.",2010,"Juozas Lazutka, Grazina Slapsyte, Petras Rimantas Venskutonis, Narimantas Cenas, Giedrius Miliauskas, Audrone Maroziene, Veronika Dedonyte, Ausra Nemeikaite-Ceniene"
"Redox regulation, gene expression and longevity",20590843,10.1111/j.1447-0594.2010.00591.x,"Lifespan can be lengthened by genetic and environmental modifications. Study of these might provide valuable insights into the mechanism of aging. Low doses of radiation and short-term exposure to heat and high concentrations of oxygen prolong the lifespan of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. These might be caused by adaptive responses to harmful environmental conditions. Single-gene mutations have been found to extend lifespan in C. elegans, Drosophila and mice. So far, the best-characterized system is the C. elegans mutant in the daf-2, insulin/IGF-I receptor gene that is the component of the insulin/IGF-I signaling pathway. The mutant animals live twice as long as the wild type. The insulin/IGF-I signaling pathway regulates the activity of DAF-16, a FOXO transcription factor. However, the unified explanation for the function of DAF-16 transcription targets in the lifespan extension is not yet fully established. As both of the Mn superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) isoforms (sod-2 and sod-3) are found to be targets of DAF-16, we attempted to assess their functions in regulating lifespan and oxidative stress responsivity. We show that the double deletions of sod-2 and sod-3 genes induced oxidative-stress sensitivity but do not shorten lifespan in the daf-2 mutant background, indicating that oxidative stress is not necessarily a limiting factor for longevity. Furthermore, the deletion in the sod-3 gene lengthens lifespan in the daf-2 mutant. We conclude that the MnSOD systems in C. elegans fine-tune the insulin/IGF-I-signaling based regulation of longevity by acting not as anti-oxidants but as physiological-redox-signaling modulators.",2010,"Yoko Honda, Shuji Honda, Masashi Tanaka"
In-vivo centrifugation of Drosophila embryos,20613707,10.3791/2005,"A major strategy for purifying and isolating different types of intracellular organelles is to separate them from each other based on differences in buoyant density. However, when cells are disrupted prior to centrifugation, proteins and organelles in this non-native environment often inappropriately stick to each other. Here we describe a method to separate organelles by density in intact, living Drosophila embryos. Early embryos before cellularization are harvested from population cages, and their outer egg shells are removed by treatment with 50% bleach. Embryos are then transferred to a small agar plate and inserted, posterior end first, into small vertical holes in the agar. The plates containing embedded embryos are centrifuged for 30 min at 3000 g. The agar supports the embryos and keeps them in a defined orientation. Afterwards, the embryos are dug out of the agar with a blunt needle. Centrifugation separates major organelles into distinct layers, a stratification easily visible by bright-field microscopy. A number of fluorescent markers are available to confirm successful stratification in living embryos. Proteins associated with certain organelles will be enriched in a particular layer, demonstrating colocalization. Individual layers can be recovered for biochemical analysis or transplantation into donor eggs. This technique is applicable for organelle separation in other large cells, including the eggs and oocytes of diverse species.",2010,"Susan L Tran, Michael A Welte"
Role of lipid metabolism in smoothened derepression in hedgehog signaling,20643350,10.1016/j.devcel.2010.06.007,"The binding of Hedgehog (Hh) to its receptor Patched causes derepression of Smoothened (Smo), resulting in the activation of the Hh pathway. Here, we show that Smo activation is dependent on the levels of the phospholipid phosphatidylinositol-4 phosphate (PI4P). Loss of STT4 kinase, which is required for the generation of PI4P, exhibits hh loss-of-function phenotypes, whereas loss of Sac1 phosphatase, which is required for the degradation of PI4P, results in hh gain-of-function phenotypes in multiple settings during Drosophila development. Furthermore, loss of Ptc function, which results in the activation of Hh pathway, also causes an increase in PI4P levels. Sac1 functions downstream of STT4 and Ptc in the regulation of Smo membrane localization and Hh pathway activation. Taken together, our results suggest a model in which Ptc directly or indirectly functions to suppress the accumulation of PI4P. Binding of Hh to Ptc derepresses the levels of PI4P, which, in turn, promotes Smo activation.",2010,"Andrew Folick, Tyler Hillman, Utpal Banerjee, Raghavendra Nagaraj, Matthew P Scott, Kathy Ngo, Rajat Rohatgi, Gerald Call, Edward Owusu-Ansah, Amir Yavari"
Two hemocyte lineages exist in silkworm larval hematopoietic organ,20676370,10.1371/journal.pone.0011816,"Background: Insects have multiple hemocyte morphotypes with different functions as do vertebrates, however, their hematopoietic lineages are largely unexplored with the exception of Drosophila melanogaster. Methodology/principal findings: To study the hematopoietic lineage of the silkworm, Bombyx mori, we investigated in vivo and in vitro differentiation of hemocyte precursors in the hematopoietic organ (HPO) into the four mature hemocyte subsets, namely, plasmatocytes, granulocytes, oenocytoids, and spherulocytes. Five days after implantation of enzymatically-dispersed HPO cells from a GFP-expressing transgenic line into the hemocoel of normal larvae, differentiation into plasmatocytes, granulocytes and oenocytoids, but not spherulocytes, was observed. When the HPO cells were cultured in vitro, plasmatocytes appeared rapidly, and oenocytoids possessing prophenol oxidase activity appeared several days later. HPO cells were also able to differentiate into a small number of granulocytes, but not into spherulocytes. When functionally mature plasmatocytes were cultured in vitro, oenocytoids were observed 10 days later. These results suggest that the hemocyte precursors in HPO first differentiate into plasmatocytes, which further change into oenocytoids. Conclusions/significance: From these results, we propose that B. mori hemocytes can be divided into two major lineages, a granulocyte lineage and a plasmatocyte-oenocytoid lineage. The origins of the spherulocytes could not be determined in this study. We construct a model for the hematopoietic lineages at the larval stage of B. mori.",2010,"Yuichi Nakahara, Yasushi Kanamori, Manabu Kamimura, Makoto Kiuchi"
"Heterochromatin, small RNA and post-fertilization dysgenesis in allopolyploid and interploid hybrids of Arabidopsis",20409176,10.1111/j.1469-8137.2010.03193.x,"In many plants, including Arabidopsis, hybrids between species and subspecies encounter postfertilization barriers in which hybrid seed fail to develop, or else give rise to infertile progeny. In Arabidopsis, some of these barriers are sensitive to ploidy and to the epigenetic status of donor and recipient genomes. Recently, a role has been proposed for heterochromatin in reprogramming events that occur in reproductive cells, as well as in the embryo and endosperm after fertilization. 21 nt small interfering RNA (siRNA) from activated transposable elements accumulate in pollen, and are translocated from companion vegetative cells into the sperm, while in the maturing seed 24 nt siRNA are primarily maternal in origin. Thus maternal and paternal genomes likely contribute differing small RNA to the zygote and to the endosperm. As heterochromatic sequences also differ radically between, and within, species, small RNA sequences will diverge in hybrids. If transposable elements in the seed are not targeted by small RNA from the pollen, or vice versa, this could lead to hybrid seed failure, in a mechanism reminiscent of hybrid dysgenesis in Drosophila. Heterochromatin also plays a role in apomixis and nucleolar dominance, and may utilize a similar mechanism.",2010,Robert A Martienssen
Human TRIB2 is a repressor of FOXO that contributes to the malignant phenotype of melanoma cells,20208562,10.1038/onc.2010.58,"FOXO transcription factors are evolutionarily conserved proteins that orchestrate gene expression programs known to control a variety of cellular processes such as cell cycle, apoptosis, DNA repair and protection from oxidative stress. As the abrogation of FOXO function is a key feature of many tumor cells, regulation of FOXO factors is receiving increasing attention in cancer research. In order to discover genes involved in the regulation of FOXO activity, we performed a large-scale RNA-mediated interference (RNAi) screen using cell-based reporter systems that monitor transcriptional activity and subcellular localization of FOXO. We identified genes previously implicated in phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt signaling events, which are known to be important for FOXO function. In addition, we discovered a previously unrecognized FOXO-repressor function of TRIB2, the mammalian homolog of the Drosophila gene tribbles. A cancer-profiling array revealed specific overexpression of TRIB2 in malignant melanoma, but not in other types of skin cancer. We provide experimental evidence that TRIB2 transcript levels correlate with the degree of cytoplasmic localization of FOXO3a. Moreover, we show that TRIB2 is important in the maintenance of the oncogenic properties of melanoma cells, as its silencing reduces cell proliferation, colony formation and wound healing. Tumor growth was also substantially reduced upon RNAi-mediated TRIB2 knockdown in an in vivo melanoma xenograft model. Our studies suggest that TRIB2 provides the melanoma cells with growth and survival advantages through the abrogation of FOXO function. Altogether, our results show the potential of large-scale cell-based RNAi screens to identify promising diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets.",2010,"B García, S Peregrina, F Zanella, W Link, A Carnero, A Dopazo, S Callejas, O Renner"
A Coronin7 homolog with functions in actin-driven processes,20071332,10.1074/jbc.M109.083725,"Dictyostelium discoideum Coronin7 (DdCRN7) together with human Coronin7 (CRN7) and Pod-1 of Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans belong to the coronin family of WD-repeat domain-containing proteins. Coronin7 proteins are characterized by two WD-repeat domains that presumably fold into two beta-propeller structures. DdCRN7 shares highest homology with human CRN7, a protein with roles in membrane trafficking. DdCRN7 is present in the cytosol and accumulates in cell surface projections during movement and phago- and pinocytosis. Cells lacking CRN7 have altered chemotaxis and phagocytosis. Furthermore, loss of CRN7 affects the infection process by the pathogen Legionella pneumophila and allows a more efficient internalization of bacteria. To provide a mechanism for CNR7 action, we studied actin-related aspects. We could show that CRN7 binds directly to F-actin and protects actin filaments from depolymerization. CRN7 also associated with F-actin in vivo. It was present in the Triton X-100-insoluble cytoskeleton, colocalized with F-actin, and its distribution was sensitive to drugs affecting the actin cytoskeleton. We propose that the CRN7 role in chemotaxis and phagocytosis is through its effect on the actin cytoskeleton.",2010,"Michael Schleicher, Angelika A Noegel, Can Unal, Ludwig Eichinger, Michael Steinert, Maria C Shina, Annette Müller-Taubenberger"

Behavioral characterization of individual olfactory memory retrieval in Drosophila melanogaster,21258642,10.3389/fnbeh.2010.00192,"Memory performance depends not only on effective learning and storage of information, but also on its efficient retrieval. In Drosophila, aversive olfactory conditioning generates qualitatively different forms of memory depending on the number and spacing of conditioning trials. However, it is not known how these differences are reflected at the retrieval level, in the behavior of individual flies during testing. We analyzed conditioned behaviors after one conditioning trial and after massed and spaced repeated trials. The single conditioning produces an early memory that was tested at 1.5 h. Tested at 24 h after training, the spaced and the massed protocols generate two different forms of consolidated memory, dependent, or independent of de novo protein-synthesis. We found clearly distinct patterns of locomotor activity in flies trained with either spaced or massed conditioning protocols. Spaced-trained flies exhibited immediate and dynamic choices between punished and unpunished odors during the test, whereas massed-trained flies made a delayed choice and showed earlier disappearance of the conditioned response. Flies trained with single and spaced trials responded to the punished odor by decreasing their resting time, but not massed-trained flies. These findings demonstrate that genetically and pharmacologically distinct forms of memory drive characteristically different forms of locomotor behavior during retrieval, and they may shed light on our previous observation that memory retrieval in massed-trained flies is socially facilitated. Social interactions would enhance exploratory activity, and then reduce the latency of their conditioned choice and delay its extinction.",2010,"Thomas Preat, Marie-Ange Chabaud, Laure Kaiser"
Non-cell-autonomous control of denticle diversity in the Drosophila embryo,20332154,10.1242/dev.045450,"Certain Drosophila embryonic epidermal cells construct actin-based protrusions, called denticles, which exhibit stereotyped, column-specific differences in size, density and hook orientation. This precise denticle pattern is conserved throughout all drosophilids yet studied, and screening for mutations that affect this pattern has been used to identify genes involved in development and signaling. However, how column-specific differences are specified and the mechanism(s) involved have remained elusive. Here, we show that the transcription factor Stripe is required for multiple aspects of this column-specific denticle pattern, including denticle hook orientation. The induction of stripe expression in certain denticle field cells appears to be the primary mechanism by which developmental pathways assign denticle hook orientation. Furthermore, we show that the cytoskeletal linker protein Short stop (Shot) functions both cell-autonomously and non-autonomously to specify denticle hook orientation via interaction with the microtubule cytoskeleton. We propose that stripe mediates its effect on hook orientation, in part, via upregulation of shot.",2010,"Stacie A Dilks, Stephen DiNardo"
Dissecting the functional specificities of two Hox proteins,20634319,10.1101/gad.1936910,"Hox proteins frequently select and regulate their specific target genes with the help of cofactors like Extradenticle (Exd) and Homothorax (Hth). For the Drosophila Hox protein Sex combs reduced (Scr), Exd has been shown to position a normally unstructured portion of Scr so that two basic amino acid side chains can insert into the minor groove of an Scr-specific DNA-binding site. Here we provide evidence that another Drosophila Hox protein, Deformed (Dfd), uses a very similar mechanism to achieve specificity in vivo, thus generalizing this mechanism. Furthermore, we show that subtle differences in the way Dfd and Scr recognize their specific binding sites, in conjunction with non-DNA-binding domains, influence whether the target gene is transcriptionally activated or repressed. These results suggest that the interaction between these DNA-binding proteins and the DNA-binding site determines the architecture of the Hox-cofactor-DNA ternary complex, which in turn determines whether the complex recruits coactivators or corepressors.",2010,"Liping Sun, Richard Mann, Rohit Joshi"
Optogenetically Induced Olfactory Stimulation in Drosophila Larvae Reveals the Neuronal Basis of Odor-Aversion behavior,20577637,10.3389/fnbeh.2010.00027,"Olfactory stimulation induces an odor-guided crawling behavior of Drosophila melanogaster larvae characterized by either an attractive or a repellent reaction. In order to understand the underlying processes leading to these orientations we stimulated single olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) through photo-activation within an intact neuronal network. Using the Gal4-UAS system two light inducible proteins, the light-sensitive cation channel channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR-2) or the light-sensitive adenylyl cyclase (Pacalpha) were expressed in all or in individual ORNs of the larval olfactory system. Blue light stimulation caused an activation of these neurons, ultimately producing the illusion of an odor stimulus. Larvae were tested in a phototaxis assay for their orientation toward or away from the light source. Here we show that activation of Pacalpha expressing ORNs bearing the receptors Or33b or Or45a in blind norpA mutant larvae induces a repellent behavior away from the light. Conversely, photo-activation of the majority of ORNs induces attraction towards the light. Interestingly, in wild type larvae two ligands of Or33b and Or45a, octyl acetate and propionic ethylester, respectively, have been found to cause an escape reaction. Therefore, we combined light and odor stimulation to analyze the function of Or33b and Or45a expressing ORNs. We show that the larval olfactory system contains a designated neuronal pathway for repellent odorants and that activation of a specific class of ORNs already determines olfactory avoidance behavior.",2010,"Arnd Richardt, Nidhi Nuwal, André Fiala, Dennis Bellmann, Klemens F Störtkuhl, Martin Schwärzel, Robert Freyberger"
Identification of a neural circuit that underlies the effects of octopamine on sleep:wake behavior,20223202,10.1016/j.neuron.2010.01.032,"An understanding of sleep requires the identification of distinct cellular circuits that mediate the action of specific sleep:wake-regulating molecules, but such analysis has been very limited. We identify here a circuit that underlies the wake-promoting effects of octopamine in Drosophila. Using MARCM, we identified the ASM cells in the medial protocerebrum as the wake-promoting octopaminergic cells. We then blocked octopamine signaling in random areas of the fly brain and mapped the postsynaptic effect to insulin-secreting neurons of the pars intercerebralis (PI). These PI neurons show altered potassium channel function as well as an increase in cAMP in response to octopamine, and genetic manipulation of their electrical excitability alters sleep:wake behavior. Effects of octopamine on sleep:wake are mediated by the cAMP-dependent isoform of the OAMB receptor. These studies define the cellular and molecular basis of octopamine action and suggest that the PI is a sleep:wake-regulating neuroendocrine structure like the mammalian hypothalamus.",2010,"Amita Sehgal, Irwin B Levitan, Amanda Crocker, Mohammad Shahidullah"
The isoforms of the p53 protein,20300206,10.1101/cshperspect.a000927,"p53 is a transcription factor with a key role in the maintenance of genetic stability and therefore preventing cancer formation. It belongs to a family of genes composed of p53, p63, and p73. The p63 and p73 genes have a dual gene structure with an internal promoter in intron-3 and together with alternative splicing, can express 6 and 29 mRNA variants, respectively. Such a complex expression pattern had not been previously described for the p53 gene, which was not consistent with our understanding of the evolution of the p53 gene family. Consequently, we revisited the human p53 gene structure and established that it encodes nine different p53 protein isoforms because of alternative splicing, alternative promoter usage, and alternative initiation sites of translation. Therefore, the human p53 gene family (p53, p63, and p73) has a dual gene structure. We determined that the dual gene structure is conserved in Drosophila and in zebrafish p53 genes. The conservation through evolution of the dual gene structure suggests that the p53 isoforms play an important role in p53 tumor-suppressor activity. We and others have established that the p53 isoforms can regulate cell-fate outcome in response to stress, by modulating p53 transcriptional activity in a promoter and stress-dependent manner. We have also shown that the p53 isoforms are abnormally expressed in several types of human cancers, suggesting that they play an important role in cancer formation.

Beta-catenin phosphorylated at serine 45 is spatially uncoupled from beta-catenin phosphorylated in the GSK3 domain: implications for signaling,20419129,10.1371/journal.pone.0010184,"C. elegans and Drosophila generate distinct signaling and adhesive forms of beta-catenin at the level of gene expression. Whether vertebrates, which rely on a single beta-catenin gene, generate unique adhesive and signaling forms at the level of protein modification remains unresolved. We show that beta-catenin unphosphorylated at serine 37 (S37) and threonine 41 (T41), commonly referred to as transcriptionally Active beta-Catenin (ABC), is a minor nuclear-enriched monomeric form of beta-catenin in SW480 cells, which express low levels of E-cadherin. Despite earlier indications, the superior signaling activity of ABC is not due to reduced cadherin binding, as ABC is readily incorporated into cadherin contacts in E-cadherin-restored cells. Beta-catenin phosphorylated at serine 45 (S45) or threonine 41 (T41) (T41/S45) or along the GSK3 regulatory cassette S33, S37 or T41 (S33/37/T41), however, is largely unable to associate with cadherins. Beta-catenin phosphorylated at T41/S45 and unphosphorylated at S37 and T41 is predominantly nuclear, while beta-catenin phosphorylated at S33/37/T41 is mostly cytoplasmic, suggesting that beta-catenin hypophosphorylated at S37 and T41 may be more active in transcription due to its enhanced nuclear accumulation. Evidence that phosphorylation at T41/S45 can be spatially separated from phosphorylations at S33/37/T41 suggests that these phosphorylations may not always be coupled, raising the possibility that phosphorylation at S45 serves a distinct nuclear function.",2010,"Rigen Mo, Cara J Gottardi, Meghan T Maher, Ofra N Peled, Annette S Flozak"
Role and regulation of human tumor suppressor SUFU in Hedgehog signaling,19055941,10.1016/S0065-230X(08)00402-8,"Originally identified as factors affecting Drosophila embryogenesis, the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway is one of the primary signaling systems that specify patterns of cell growth and differentiation during vertebrate development. Mutations in various components of this pathway frequently occur in tumors originated from the skin, cerebellum, and skeletal muscle, and abnormal pathway activity is associated with a subset of lung, digestive tract, pancreatic, and prostate cancers. Because of these potent biological activities, this pathway is negatively regulated at multiple levels to ensure appropriate signaling responses. Suppressor of fused (Sufu) is one such negative regulator of Hh signaling. Although not essential in Drosophila, Sufu is absolutely required for mouse embryonic development. Mutations of Sufu are associated with a childhood brain tumor in human and an increased susceptibility to the same type of cancer in the TP53 null background in mice, and RNAi-mediated silencing of Sufu is sufficient to activate the Hh signaling in cultured fibroblasts. All these data point to a central role of Sufu in controlling the vertebrate Hh signaling pathway; however, for years what exactly Sufu does in the Hh pathway and what controls its activity remains a deep mystery. This chapter will go over all studies curated in the PubMed database with Sufu as a main subject during the past 17 years, and attempt to provide a balanced view on Sufu gene and protein structure, activities in Drosophila as well as mammalian development, and its involvement in cancer.",2008,"Steven Y Cheng, Shen Yue"
Enhancer blocking and transvection at the Drosophila apterous locus,18202363,10.1534/genetics.107.077768,"Intra- and interchromosomal interactions have been implicated in a number of genetic phenomena in diverse organisms, suggesting that the higher-order structural organization of chromosomes in the nucleus can have a profound impact on gene regulation. In Drosophila, homologous chromosomes remain paired in somatic tissues, allowing for trans interactions between genes and regulatory elements on the two homologs. One consequence of homolog pairing is the phenomenon of transvection, in which regulatory elements on one homolog can affect the expression of a gene in trans. We report a new instance of transvection at the Drosophila apterous (ap) locus. Two different insertions of boundary elements in the ap regulatory region were identified. The boundaries are inserted between the ap wing enhancer and the ap promoter and have highly penetrant wing defects typical of mutants in ap. When crossed to an ap promoter deletion, both boundary inserts exhibit the interallelic complementation characteristic of transvection. To confirm that transvection occurs at ap, we generated a deletion of the ap wing enhancer by FRT-mediated recombination. When the wing-enhancer deletion is crossed to the ap promoter deletion, strong transvection is observed. Interestingly, the two boundary elements, which are inserted approximately 10 kb apart, fail to block enhancer action when they are present in trans to one another. We demonstrate that this is unlikely to be due to insulator bypass. The transvection effects described here may provide insight into the role that boundary element pairing plays in enhancer blocking both in cis and in trans.",2008,"Vincenzo Pirrotta, Martin Müller, Daryl Gohl, Paul Schedl, Markus Affolter"
Characterization of Drosophila G9a in vivo and identification of genetic interactants,18498352,10.1111/j.1365-2443.2008.01199.x,"In mammals, G9a is a histone H3 lysine 9 (H3-K9)-specific histone methyltransferase (HMTase), known to be essential for murine embryogenesis. It has been reported that Drosophila G9a (dG9a) is a dominant suppressor of position effects of variegation, has HMTase activity in vitro, and is important for Drosophila development. Here we show that dG9a has H3-K9 dimethylation activity in vivo and is important for the recruitment of HP1 in the euchromatic region. Over-expression in eye imaginal discs inhibited the differentiation of pupal ommatidial cells and resulted in abnormal eye morphology (rough eye phenotype) in the adults, although a methylase defective mutant did not demonstrate such effects. These results suggest that HMTase activity of dG9a affects transcription of genes involved in pupal eye formation. The dG9a-induced rough eye phenotype was enhanced by a half-dose reduction of the Polycomb group (PcG) gene. In contrast, mutants for little imaginal discs (lid), encoding histone H3-K4 demethylase, demonstrated suppression of the rough eye phenotype induced by dG9a. Furthermore co-expression of Lid in eye imaginal discs enhanced the rough phenotype induced by dG9a.

Orthologues of Hem1 in Dictyostelium discoideum, Drosophila melanogaster, and Caenorhabditis elegans are essential for cytoskeletal reorganization, embryonic cell migration, and morphogenesis. However, the in vivo functions of mammalian Hem1 are not known. Using a chemical mutagenesis strategy in mice to identify novel genes involved in immune cell functions, we positionally cloned a nonsense mutation in the Hem1 gene. Hem1 deficiency results in defective F-actin polymerization and actin capping in lymphocytes and neutrophils caused by loss of the Rac-controlled actin-regulatory WAVE protein complex. T cell development is disrupted in Hem1-deficient mice at the CD4(-)CD8(-) (double negative) to CD4(+)CD8(+) (double positive) cell stages, whereas T cell activation and adhesion are impaired. Hem1-deficient neutrophils fail to migrate in response to chemotactic agents and are deficient in their ability to phagocytose bacteria. Remarkably, some Rac-dependent functions, such as Th1 differentiation and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB)-dependent transcription of proinflammatory cytokines proceed normally in Hem1-deficient mice, whereas the production of Th17 cells are enhanced. These results demonstrate that Hem1 is essential for hematopoietic cell development, function, and homeostasis by controlling a distinct pathway leading to cytoskeletal reorganization, whereas NF-kappaB-dependent transcription proceeds independently of Hem1 and F-actin polymerization.",2008,"Yi Zhang, Brian M Iritani, George Carlson, Mary E Brunkow, Sherree Friend, Charles Frevert, Mark Tsang, H Denny Liggitt, Tania Habib, Heon Park, Karen Staehling-Hampton, Brian Freie, Mark W Appleby, Fred Ramsdell"

Wing morphology in F1 hybrids exhibited an important degree of phenotypic plasticity and differs significantly from both parental species. However, the pattern of morphological variation between hybrids and the parental strains varied between wing size and wing shape, across rearing media, sexes, and crosses, suggesting a complex genetic architecture underlying divergence in wing morphology. Even though there was significant fluctuating asymmetry for both, wing size and shape in F1 hybrids and both parental species, there was no evidence of an increased degree of fluctuating asymmetry in hybrids as compared to parental species. These results are interpreted in terms of developmental stability as a function of a balance between levels of heterozygosity and the disruption of coadaptation as an indirect consequence of genomic divergence.",2008,"Valeria P Carreira, Esteban Hasson, Ignacio M Soto, Juan J Fanara"
"Drosophila asymmetric division, polarity and cancer",19029940,10.1038/onc.2008.349,"A limited number of adult stem cells (SCs) maintain the homoestasis of different tissues through the lifetime of the individual by generating differentiating daughters and renewing themselves.

Negative effects of low temperatures on the vertical transmission and infection density of a spiroplasma endosymbiont in Drosophila hydei,18618173,10.1007/s00284-008-9199-4,"Maternally transmitted endosymbionts of the genus Spiroplasma infecting several species of Drosophila are known to cause selective death of male offspring (male killing). The male-killing trait is considered to be advantageous for maternally transmitted endosymbionts. However, a non-male-killing spiroplasma is present in Japanese populations of Drosophila hydei at high frequencies (23-66%). This spiroplasma is phylogenetically closely related to the male-killing spiroplasma infecting other Drosophila species. It is unknown why this spiroplasma is maintained in its host populations despite its inability to cause male killing. We examined the susceptibilities of the spiroplasma in D. hydei to four different temperatures (28, 25, 18, and 15 degrees C). Diagnostic PCR revealed that vertical transmission of the spiroplasma was nearly perfect at 28 and 25 degrees C, partially suppressed at 18 degrees C, and completely blocked at 15 degrees C. Furthermore, quantitative PCR demonstrated that offspring treated at 18 degrees C exhibited dramatically lower densities of spiroplasma (i.e., approximately one-tenth) compared to offspring treated at 28 and 25 degrees C. Considering the low temperatures during winter in Japan, some unknown advantageous effects of the spiroplasma that compensate for the failure of vertical transmission are suggested to act in natural populations of D. hydei.",2008,"Ryu Osaka, Masayoshi Watada, Daisuke Kageyama, Masashi Nomura"

Nrf2 is a prominent target for drug discovery, and Nrf2-activating agents are in clinical trials for cancer chemoprevention. However, aberrant activation of Nrf2 by keap1 somatic mutations may contribute to carcinogenesis and promote resistance to chemotherapy. To evaluate potential functions of Keap1 and Nrf2 for organismal homeostasis, we characterized the pathway in Drosophila. We demonstrate that Keap1/Nrf2 signaling in the fruit fly is activated by oxidants, induces antioxidant and detoxification responses, and confers increased tolerance to oxidative stress. Importantly, keap1 loss-of-function mutations extend the lifespan of Drosophila males, supporting a role for Nrf2 signaling in the regulation of longevity.

Some Dilp peptides carry both metabolic and growth functions, raising the possibility that various binding partners specify their functions. Here we identify dALS, the fly ortholog of the vertebrate insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-binding protein acid-labile subunit (ALS), as a Dilp partner that forms a circulating trimeric complex with one molecule of Dilp and one molecule of Imp-L2, an IgG-family molecule distantly related to mammalian IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs).

"Axoneme specialization embedded in a ""generalist"" beta-tubulin",18157906,10.1002/cm.20256,"The relationship between the primary structure of the beta-tubulin C-terminal tail (CTT) and axoneme structure and function is explored using the spermatogenesis-specific beta2-tubulin of Drosophila. We previously showed that all beta-tubulins used for motile 9 + 2 axonemes contain a conserved sequence motif in the proximal part of the CTT, the beta-tubulin axoneme motif. The differential ability of tubulin isoforms and abilities of beta2-tubulin C-terminal truncations to form axonemes led us to hypothesize that the axoneme motif is essential for axoneme formation and the distal half of the CTT was less important. The studies we report here indicate that it is not that simple. Unexpectedly, some changes in the core sequence of the axoneme motif did not disrupt formation of motile axonemes. And, while deletion of the distal CTT did not disrupt the ability to produce functional sperm [Popodi et al., Cell Motil Cytoskeleton 2005;62:48-64], changing the amino acid sequence in this region can. Thus both regions are important. The deep conservation of the axoneme motif in all eukaryotic groups implies that the presence of the sequence motif confers a functional advantage. The central pair is the axoneme structure most sensitive to perturbations in tubulin molecules; we hypothesize central pair assembly is facilitated by the presence of this motif. Our data reveal that beta2-tubulin has robust properties for axoneme assembly, and that axonemal specializations are embedded in both the CTT and the body of the beta2 molecule.",2008,"Henry D Hoyle, F Rudolf Turner, Ellen M Popodi, Ke Xu, Elizabeth C Raff, Spencer Kruse"
Mechanisms underlying hypoxia tolerance in Drosophila melanogaster: hairy as a metabolic switch,18927626,10.1371/journal.pgen.1000221,"Hypoxia-induced cell injury has been related to multiple pathological conditions. In order to render hypoxia-sensitive cells and tissues resistant to low O2 environment, in this current study, we used Drosophila melanogaster as a model to dissect the mechanisms underlying hypoxia-tolerance. A D. melanogaster strain that lives perpetually in an extremely low-oxygen environment (4% O2, an oxygen level that is equivalent to that over about 4,000 m above Mt. Everest) was generated through laboratory selection pressure using a continuing reduction of O2 over many generations. This phenotype is genetically stable since selected flies, after several generations in room air, survive at this low O2 level. Gene expression profiling showed striking differences between tolerant and naïve flies, in larvae and adults, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Up-regulated genes in the tolerant flies included signal transduction pathways (e.g., Notch and Toll/Imd pathways), but metabolic genes were remarkably down-regulated in the larvae. Furthermore, a different allelic frequency and enzymatic activity of the triose phosphate isomerase (TPI) was present in the tolerant versus naïve flies. The transcriptional suppressor, hairy, was up-regulated in the microarrays and its binding elements were present in the regulatory region of the specifically down-regulated metabolic genes but not others, and mutations in hairy significantly reduced hypoxia tolerance. We conclude that, the hypoxia-selected flies: (a) altered their gene expression and genetic code, and (b) coordinated their metabolic suppression, especially during development, with hairy acting as a metabolic switch, thus playing a crucial role in hypoxia-tolerance.",2008,"Jin Xue, Dan Zhou, Nicholas J Schork, Gabriel G Haddad, James C K Lai, Kevin P White"
Microtubule anchoring by cortical actin bundles prevents streaming of the oocyte cytoplasm,18053693,10.1016/j.mod.2007.09.008,"The localisation of the determinants of the body axis during Drosophila oogenesis is dependent on the microtubule (MT) cytoskeleton. Mutations in the actin binding proteins Profilin, Cappuccino (Capu) and Spire result in premature streaming of the cytoplasm and a reorganisation of the oocyte MT network. As a consequence, the localisation of axis determinants is abolished in these mutants. It is unclear how actin regulates the organisation of the MTs, or what the spatial relationship between these two cytoskeletal elements is. Here, we report a careful analysis of the oocyte cytoskeleton. We identify thick actin bundles at the oocyte cortex, in which the minus ends of the MTs are embedded. Disruption of these bundles results in cortical release of the MT minus ends, and premature onset of cytoplasmic streaming. Thus, our data indicate that the actin bundles anchor the MTs minus ends at the oocyte cortex, and thereby prevent streaming of the cytoplasm. We further show that actin bundle formation requires Profilin but not Capu and Spire. Thus, our results support a model in which Profilin acts in actin bundle nucleation, while Capu and Spire link the bundles to MTs. Finally, our data indicate how cytoplasmic streaming contributes to the reorganisation of the MT cytoskeleton. We show that the release of the MT minus ends from the cortex occurs independently of streaming, while the formation of MT bundles is streaming dependent.",2008,"Veit Riechmann, Ying Wang"

The human TPR protein TTC4 is a putative Hsp90 co-chaperone which interacts with CDC6 and shows alterations in transformed cells,18320024,10.1371/journal.pone.0001737,"Background: The human TTC4 protein is a TPR (tetratricopeptide repeat) motif-containing protein. The gene was originally identified as being localized in a genomic region linked to breast cancer and subsequent studies on melanoma cell lines revealed point mutations in the TTC4 protein that may be associated with the progression of malignant melanoma. Methodology/principle findings: Here we show that TTC4 is a nucleoplasmic protein which interacts with HSP90 and HSP70, and also with the replication protein CDC6. It has significant structural and functional similarities with a previously characterised Drosophila protein Dpit47. We show that TTC4 protein levels are raised in malignant melanoma cell lines compared to melanocytes. We also see increased TTC4 expression in a variety of tumour lines derived from other tissues. In addition we show that TTC4 proteins bearing some of the mutations previously identified from patient samples lose their interaction with the CDC6 protein. Conclusions/significance: Based on these results and our previous work with the Drosophila Dpit47 protein we suggest that TTC4 is an HSP90 co-chaperone protein which forms a link between HSP90 chaperone activity and DNA replication. We further suggest that the loss of the interaction with CDC6 or with additional client proteins could provide one route through which TTC4 could influence malignant development of cells.",2008,"Sue Cotterill, Gilles Crevel, Dorothy Bennett"
Roles of Pofut1 and O-fucose in mammalian Notch signaling,18347015,10.1074/jbc.M802027200,"Mammalian Notch receptors contain 29-36 epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats that may be modified by protein O-fucosyltransferase 1 (Pofut1), an essential component of the canonical Notch signaling pathway. The Drosophila orthologue Ofut1 is proposed to function as both a chaperone required for stable cell surface expression of Notch and a protein O-fucosyltransferase. Here we investigate these dual roles of Pofut1 in relation to endogenous Notch receptors of Chinese hamster ovary and murine embryonic stem (ES) cells. We show that fucosylation-deficient Lec13 Chinese hamster ovary cells have wild type levels of Pofut1 and cell surface Notch receptors. Nevertheless, they have reduced binding of Notch ligands and low levels of Delta1- and Jagged1-induced Notch signaling. Exogenous fucose but not galactose rescues both ligand binding and Notch signaling. Murine ES cells lacking Pofut1 also have wild type levels of cell surface Notch receptors. However, Pofut1-/- ES cells do not bind Notch ligands or exhibit Notch signaling. Although overexpression of fucosyltransferase-defective Pofut1 R245A in Pofut1-/- cells partially rescues ligand binding and Notch signaling, this effect is not specific. The same rescue is achieved by an unrelated, inactive, endoplasmic reticulum glucosidase. Therefore, mammalian Notch receptors require Pofut1 for the generation of optimally functional Notch receptors, but, in contrast to Drosophila, Pofut1 is not required for stable cell surface expression of Notch. Importantly, we also show that, under certain circumstances, mammalian Notch receptors are capable of signaling in the absence of Pofut1 and O-fucose.",2008,"Changhui Ge, Pamela Stanley, Shaolin Shi, Yuko Tashima, Kazuhide Uemura, Mark Stahl"

The Nore1B/Mst1 complex restrains antigen receptor-induced proliferation of naïve T cells,19073936,10.1073/pnas.0810773105,"The Mst1 and Mst2 protein kinases are the mammalian homologs of hippo, a major inhibitor of cell proliferation in Drosophila. Mst1 is most abundant in lymphoid tissues. Mice lacking Mst1 exhibit markedly reduced levels of the Mst1 regulatory protein Nore1B/RAPL in lymphoid cells, whereas Mst2 abundance is unaltered. Mst1-null mice exhibit normal T cell development but low numbers of mature naïve T cells with relatively normal numbers of effector/memory T cells. In vitro, the Mst1-deficient naïve T cells exhibit markedly greater proliferation in response to stimulation of the T cell receptor whereas the proliferative responses of the Mst1-null effector/memory T cell cohort is similar to wild type. Thus, elimination of Mst1 removes a barrier to the activation and proliferative response of naïve T cells. The levels of Mst1 and Nore1B/RAPL in wild-type effector/memory T cells are approximately 10% those seen in wild-type naïve T cells, which may contribute to the enhanced proliferative responses of the former. Freshly isolated Mst1-null T cells exhibit high rates of ongoing apoptosis, a likely basis for their low numbers in vivo; they also exhibit defective clustering of LFA-1, as previously observed for Nore1B/RAPL-deficient T cells. Among known Mst1 substrates, only the phosphorylation of the cell cycle inhibitory proteins MOBKL1A/B is lost entirely in TCR-stimulated, Mst1-deficient T cells. Mst1/2-catalyzed MOBKL1A/B phosphorylation slows proliferation and is therefore a likely contributor to the anti-proliferative action of Mst1 in naïve T cells.

We isolated several actin and myosin proteins, three of the five Drosophila septins and RacGAP50C (Tum), a component of the centralspindlin complex. Using drug and RNA interference (RNAi) treatments we established that F-actin is essential for Anillin cortical localization in prometaphase but not for its accumulation at the cleavage furrow after anaphase onset. Moreover, septins were not recruited to the cleavage site in cells in which Anillin was knocked down by RNAi, but localized to central-spindle microtubules, suggesting that septins travel along microtubules to interact with Anillin at the furrow. Finally, we demonstrate that RacGAP50C is necessary for Anillin accumulation at the furrow and that the two proteins colocalize in vivo and interact in vitro. Thus, in addition to its role in activating RhoA signalling, RacGAP50C also controls the proper assembly of the actomyosin ring by interacting with Anillin at the cleavage furrow.",2008,"Wei Zhang, Tetsuya Takeda, Pier Paolo D'Avino, David M Glover, Kathryn S Lilley, Luisa Capalbo, Ernest D Laue"
Effects of local mRNA structure on posttranscriptional gene silencing,18784366,10.1073/pnas.0805781105,"Antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (AONs) and short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) effect posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS) by hybridizing to an mRNA and then directing its cleavage. To understand the constraints that mRNA structure imposes on AON- vs. siRNA-mediated PTGS, AON- and siRNA-mediated cleavage of defined mRNA structures was monitored in Drosophila embryo whole-cell lysates. We observed that AON-directed cleavage was approximately 3-fold faster than cleavage with a siRNA directed to the same target site. Furthermore, and unexpectedly, AON-mediated cleavage was found to be much less fastidious with respect to target sequence accessibility, as measured by the presence of unpaired nucleotides, than a corresponding siRNA. Nonetheless, in vivo, siRNAs silenced their mRNA target at least 2-fold more efficiently than the corresponding AON. These seemingly contradictory results suggested that additional, as yet undefined factors play an important role in regulating PTGS efficiency in vivo. We used a well defined RNA-binding protein, alphaCP, and its corresponding high-affinity RNA-binding site to explore this hypothesis. We found that prebound alphaCP effectively blocked AON-mediated cleavage of the RNA-binding site compared with cleavage of the site in the absence of alphaCP. We conclude that higher-order structures formed by RNA and bound proteins play an important role in determining the efficiency of AON-directed PTGS.

Coordinate control of synaptic-layer specificity and rhodopsins in photoreceptor neurons,18978774,10.1038/nature07419,"How neurons make specific synaptic connections is a central question in neurobiology. The targeting of the Drosophila R7 and R8 photoreceptor axons to different synaptic layers in the brain provides a model with which to explore the genetic programs regulating target specificity. In principle this can be accomplished by cell-type-specific molecules mediating the recognition between synaptic partners. Alternatively, specificity could also be achieved through cell-type-specific repression of particular targeting molecules. Here we show that a key step in the targeting of the R7 neuron is the active repression of the R8 targeting program. Repression is dependent on NF-YC, a subunit of the NF-Y (nuclear factor Y) transcription factor. In the absence of NF-YC, R7 axons terminate in the same layer as R8 axons. Genetic experiments indicate that this is due solely to the derepression of the R8-specific transcription factor Senseless (Sens) late in R7 differentiation. Sens is sufficient to control R8 targeting specificity and we demonstrate that Sens directly binds to an evolutionarily conserved DNA sequence upstream of the start of transcription of an R8-specific cell-surface protein, Capricious (Caps) that regulates R8 target specificity. We show that R7 targeting requires the R7-specific transcription factor Prospero (Pros) in parallel to repression of the R8 targeting pathway by NF-YC. Previous studies demonstrated that Sens and Pros directly regulate the expression of specific rhodopsins in R8 and R7. We propose that the use of the same transcription factors to promote the cell-type-specific expression of sensory receptors and cell-surface proteins regulating synaptic target specificity provides a simple and general mechanism for ensuring that transmission of sensory information is processed by the appropriate specialized neural circuits.",2008,"Tory Herman, S Lawrence Zipursky, Enrique Blanco, Susan K Yee, Marta Morey, Aljoscha Nern"

The Drosophila heart has proven to be an excellent model to study genes involved in establishing and maintaining the structural integrity of the adult heart, as well as genes involved in maintaining physiological function. Using this model, we have identified nmr as a gene required in adult fly hearts for the maintenance of both normal myofibrillar architecture and cardiac physiology. Moreover, we have discovered synergistic interactions between nmr and other cardiac transcription factors, including tinman/Nkx2-5, in regulating cardiac performance, rhythmicity, and cardiomyocyte structure, reminiscent of similar interactions in mice. This suggests a remarkably conserved role for this network of cardiac transcription factors in the genetic control of the adult heart. In addition, nmr-tinman interactions also influence the expression of potential downstream effectors, such as ion channels. Interestingly, genetic screening of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and congenital heart disease has revealed TBX20 variants in three sporadic and two familial cases that were not found in controls. These findings suggest that the fly heart might serve as an identifier of candidate genes involved in human heart disease.",2008,"Bhagyalaxmi Mohapatra, Takeshi Akasaka, Li Qian, Karen Ocorr, Jiandong Liu, Rolf Bodmer, Jeffrey A Towbin"

Age-dependent deterioration of locomotion in Drosophila melanogaster deficient in the homologue of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 2,24702731,10.1111/gtc.12146,"Recessive mutations in the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 2 (ALS2) gene have been linked to juvenile-onset ALS2. Although one of the molecular functions of the ALS2 protein is clearly the activation of Rab5, the mechanisms underlying the selective dysfunction and degeneration of motor neurons in vivo remain to be fully understood. Here, we focused on the ALS2 homologue of Drosophila melanogaster, isolated two independent deletions, and systematically compared phenotypes of the mutants with those of animals in which Rab5 function in identified neurons was abrogated. In the dALS2 mutant flies, we found that the stereotypic axonal and dendritic morphologies of neurons shared some features with those in Rab5-deficient flies, but the dALS2 mutant phenotypes were much milder. We also found that the abrogation of Rab5 function in motor neurons strongly depressed the locomotion activity of adults, resembling the behavior of aged dALS2 mutants. Importantly, this age-dependent locomotion deficit of dALS2 mutants was restored to normal by expressing the dALS2 transgene in a wide range of tissues. This finding provided a platform where we could potentially identify particular cell types responsible for the phenotype by tissue-specific rescue experiments. We discuss our results and the future usage of the dALS2 mutant as a new ALS model.",2014,"Reina E Itoh, Tadashi Uemura, Yuta Takayama, Taiichi Tsuyama"
The neuroprotective effect of human uncoupling protein 2 (hUCP2) requires cAMP-dependent protein kinase in a toxin model of Parkinson's disease,24965893,10.1016/j.nbd.2014.05.032,"Parkinson's disease (PD), caused by selective loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra, is the most common movement disorder with no cure or effective treatment. Exposure to the mitochondrial complex I inhibitor rotenone recapitulates pathological hallmarks of PD in rodents and selective loss of DA neurons in Drosophila. However, mechanisms underlying rotenone toxicity are not completely resolved. We previously reported a neuroprotective effect of human uncoupling protein 2 (hUCP2) against rotenone toxicity in adult fly DA neurons. In the current study, we show that increased mitochondrial fusion is protective from rotenone toxicity whereas increased fission sensitizes the neurons to rotenone-induced cell loss in vivo. In primary DA neurons, rotenone-induced mitochondrial fragmentation and lethality is attenuated as the result of hucp2 expression. To test the idea that the neuroprotective mechanism of hUCP2 involves modulation of mitochondrial dynamics, we detect preserved mitochondrial network, mobility and fusion events in hucp2 expressing DA neurons exposed to rotenone. hucp2 expression also increases intracellular cAMP levels. Thus, we hypothesize that cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) might be an effector that mediates hUCP2-associated neuroprotection against rotenone. Indeed, PKA inhibitors block preserved mitochondrial integrity, movement and cell survival in hucp2 expressing DA neurons exposed to rotenone. Taken together, we present strong evidence identifying a hUCP2-PKA axis that controls mitochondrial dynamics and survival in DA neurons exposed to rotenone implicating a novel therapeutic strategy in modifying the progression of PD pathogenesis.",2014,"Xiongwei Zhu, Kavitha Kannan, Munzareen Khan, Xinglong Wang, Ran-Der Hwang, Yih-Woei C Fridell, Daewoo Lee, Lyle Wiemerslage, Christopher J LaBreck"
Modeling metabolic homeostasis and nutrient sensing in Drosophila: implications for aging and metabolic diseases,24609035,10.1242/dmm.012989,"Over the past decade, numerous reports have underscored the similarities between the metabolism of Drosophila and vertebrates, with the identification of evolutionarily conserved enzymes and analogous organs that regulate carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. It is now well established that the major metabolic, energy-sensing and endocrine signaling networks of vertebrate systems are also conserved in flies. Accordingly, studies in Drosophila are beginning to unravel how perturbed energy balance impinges on lifespan and on the ensuing diseases when energy homeostasis goes awry. Here, we highlight several emerging concepts that are at the nexus between obesity, nutrient sensing, metabolic homeostasis and aging. Specifically, we summarize the endocrine mechanisms that regulate carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, and provide an overview of the neuropeptides that regulate feeding behavior. We further describe the various efforts at modeling the effects of high-fat or -sugar diets in Drosophila and the signaling mechanisms involved in integrating organ function. Finally, we draw attention to some of the cardinal discoveries made with these disease models and how these could spur new research questions in vertebrate systems.",2014,"Edward Owusu-Ansah, Norbert Perrimon"
Water sensor ppk28 modulates Drosophila lifespan and physiology through AKH signaling,24821805,10.1073/pnas.1315461111,"Sensory perception modulates lifespan across taxa, presumably due to alterations in physiological homeostasis after central nervous system integration. The coordinating circuitry of this control, however, remains unknown. Here, we used the Drosophila melanogaster gustatory system to dissect one component of sensory regulation of aging. We found that loss of the critical water sensor, pickpocket 28 (ppk28), altered metabolic homeostasis to promote internal lipid and water stores and extended healthy lifespan. Additionally, loss of ppk28 increased neuronal glucagon-like adipokinetic hormone (AKH) signaling, and the AKH receptor was necessary for ppk28 mutant effects. Furthermore, activation of AKH-producing cells alone was sufficient to enhance longevity, suggesting that a perceived lack of water availability triggers a metabolic shift that promotes the production of metabolic water and increases lifespan via AKH signaling. This work provides an example of how discrete gustatory signals recruit nutrient-dependent endocrine systems to coordinate metabolic homeostasis, thereby influencing long-term health and aging.",2014,"Joy Alcedo, Ivan Ostojic, Brian Y Chung, Michael J Waterson, Zachary M Harvanek, Scott D Pletcher"

The heat shock is shown to affect the behavior parameters and LIMK1 content in analyzed strains of Drosophila. The most pronounced effect of the heat shock was observed at the stage of development of the central complex (CC).

Progenitor outgrowth from the niche in Drosophila trachea is guided by FGF from decaying branches,24408434,10.1126/science.1241442,"Although there has been progress identifying adult stem and progenitor cells and the signals that control their proliferation and differentiation, little is known about the substrates and signals that guide them out of their niche. By examining Drosophila tracheal outgrowth during metamorphosis, we show that progenitors follow a stereotyped path out of the niche, tracking along a subset of tracheal branches destined for destruction. The embryonic tracheal inducer branchless FGF (fibroblast growth factor) is expressed dynamically just ahead of progenitor outgrowth in decaying branches. Knockdown of branchless abrogates progenitor outgrowth, whereas misexpression redirects it. Thus, reactivation of an embryonic tracheal inducer in decaying branches directs outgrowth of progenitors that replace them. This explains how the structure of a newly generated tissue is coordinated with that of the old.",2014,"Mark A Krasnow, Feng Chen"
Chronobiology of crickets: a review,25284381,10.2108/zs140024,"Crickets provide a good model for the study of mechanisms underlying circadian rhythms and photoperiodic responses. They show clear circadian rhythms in their overt behavior and the sensitivity of the visual system. Classical neurobiological studies revealed that a pair of optic lobes is the locus of the circadian clock controlling these rhythms and that the compound eye is the major photoreceptor necessary for synchronization to environmental light cycles. The two optic lobe clocks are mutually coupled through a neural pathway and the coupling regulates an output circadian waveform and a free-running period. Recent molecular studies revealed that the cricket's clock consists of cyclic expression of so-called clock genes and that the clock mechanism is featured by both Drosophila-like and mammalian-like traits. Molecular oscillation is also observed in some extra-optic lobe tissues and depends on the optic lobe clock in a tissue dependent manner. Interestingly, the clock is also involved in adaptation to seasonally changing environment. It fits its waveform to a given photoperiod and may be an indispensable part of a photoperiodic time-measurement mechanism. With adoption of modern molecular technologies, the cricket becomes a much more important and promising model animal for the study of circadian and photoperiodic biology.",2014,Kenji Tomioka

An improved method for accurate and rapid measurement of flight performance in Drosophila,24561810,10.3791/51223,"Drosophila has proven to be a useful model system for analysis of behavior, including flight. The initial flight tester involved dropping flies into an oil-coated graduated cylinder; landing height provided a measure of flight performance by assessing how far flies will fall before producing enough thrust to make contact with the wall of the cylinder. Here we describe an updated version of the flight tester with four major improvements. First, we added a ""drop tube"" to ensure that all flies enter the flight cylinder at a similar velocity between trials, eliminating variability between users. Second, we replaced the oil coating with removable plastic sheets coated in Tangle-Trap, an adhesive designed to capture live insects. Third, we use a longer cylinder to enable more accurate discrimination of flight ability. Fourth we use a digital camera and imaging software to automate the scoring of flight performance. These improvements allow for the rapid, quantitative assessment of flight behavior, useful for large datasets and large-scale genetic screens.",2014,"Barry Ganetzky, Daniel T Babcock"

The magnitude of behavioral isolation is affected by characteristics of the mating community,25165530,10.1002/ece3.1142,"Gene exchange between species occurs in areas of secondary contact, where two species have the opportunity to hybridize. If heterospecific males are more common than conspecific males, females will experience more encounters with males of other species. These encounters might increase the likelihood of heterospecific matings, and lead to the production of hybrid progeny. I studied the mating behavior of two pairs of sibling species endemic to Africa: Drosophila yakuba/Drosophila santomea and Drosophila simulans/Drosophila sechellia. Drosophila yakuba and D. simulans are cosmopolitan species widely distributed in the African continent, while D. santomea and D. sechellia are island endemics. These pairs of species hybridize in nature and have the potential to exchange genes in natural conditions. I used these two pairs of Drosophila species, and constructed mating communities of different size and different heterospecific:conspecific composition. I found that both the total number of potential mates and the relative frequency of conspecific versus heterospecific males affect female mating decisions in the cosmopolitan species but not in the island endemics. These results suggest that the population characteristics, in which mating occurs, may affect the magnitude of premating isolation. Community composition might thus facilitate, or impair, gene flow between species.",2014,Daniel R Matute
Transcriptome analysis of the scleractinian coral Stylophora pistillata,24551124,10.1371/journal.pone.0088615,"The principal architects of coral reefs are the scleractinian corals; these species are divided in two major clades referred to as ""robust"" and ""complex"" corals.

Filling this gap affords important opportunities to extend these studies and to improve our understanding of the differences between the two major clades. Here, we present an EST library from Stylophora pistillata (Esper 1797) and systematically analyze the assembled transcripts compared to putative homologs from the complete proteomes of six well-characterized metazoans: Nematostella vectensis, Hydra magnipapillata, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, Ciona intestinalis and Homo sapiens.

Our previous studies showed that Drosophila provides a genuine model to study how AML1-ETO promotes leukemia. Here, using an in vivo RNA interference screen for suppressors of AML1-ETO activity, we identified pontin/RUVBL1 as a gene required for AML1-ETO-induced lethality and blood cell proliferation in Drosophila. We further show that PONTIN inhibition strongly impaired the growth of human t(8;21)(+) or AML1-ETO-expressing leukemic blood cells. Interestingly, AML1-ETO promoted the transcription of PONTIN. Moreover, transcriptome analysis in Kasumi-1 cells revealed a strong correlation between PONTIN and AML1-ETO gene signatures and demonstrated that PONTIN chiefly regulated the expression of genes implicated in cell cycle progression. Concordantly, PONTIN depletion inhibited leukemic self-renewal and caused cell cycle arrest. All together our data suggest that the upregulation of PONTIN by AML1-ETO participate in the oncogenic growth of t(8;21) cells.",2014,"N Martinez Soria, M Haenlin, O Heidenreich, S Bras, L Waltzer, D Osman, O Breig"
[Aging and longevity],25134349,,"During the last three centuries the expected lifespan in civilized countries has increased several times. The fastest growing groups are seniors (65+) and centenarians. Increased lifespan results in postponing of aging and age-related diseases. On the other hand, an increase in the number of people suffering from age-related diseases can be observed. Studies concerning longevity and aging help to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for these processes and give hope for finding the recipe for a healthy and long lifespan. Aging and longevity are modulated by genetic, epigenetic and stochastic factors. Already some variants of genes which correlate with longevity are known. Products of these genes are involved in lipid metabolism and in nutrient sensing signaling pathways such as: insulin/IGF-1 and TOR. Good indicators for human polymorphism study are results obtained using model organisms such as S. cerevisiae, C. elegans, D. melanogaster and laboratory mice. Aging and longevity are evolutionary conserved. Evolutionary theories concerning aging can be divided into two general categories: programmed and non-programmed ones. According to programmed theories aging is adaptive and can lead to altruistic death of kins. Non-programmed theories predict that organisms only have a limited amount of energy that has to be divided between reproductive activities and the maintenance of the non-reproductive aspects of the organism. Aging is the effect of natural degrading processes that result in the accumulation of damage. Accumulation of damaged DNA and proteins can lead to cellular senescence, inflammaging and age-related diseases. Strategies for postponing aging mainly rely on protecting and/or eliminating these lesions.",2014,Ewa Sikora
Regulation of synaptic development and function by the Drosophila PDZ protein Dyschronic,25359729,10.1242/dev.109538,"Synaptic scaffold proteins control the localization of ion channels and receptors, and facilitate molecular associations between signaling components that modulate synaptic transmission and plasticity. Here, we define novel roles for a recently described scaffold protein, Dsychronic (DYSC), at the Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction. DYSC is the Drosophila homolog of whirlin/DFNB31, a PDZ domain protein linked to Usher syndrome, the most common form of human deaf-blindness. We show that DYSC is expressed presynaptically and is often localized adjacent to the active zone, the site of neurotransmitter release. Loss of DYSC results in marked alterations in synaptic morphology and cytoskeletal organization. Moreover, active zones are frequently enlarged and misshapen in dysc mutants. Electrophysiological analyses further demonstrate that dysc mutants exhibit substantial increases in both evoked and spontaneous synaptic transmission. We have previously shown that DYSC binds to and regulates the expression of the Slowpoke (SLO) BK potassium channel. Consistent with this, slo mutant larvae exhibit similar alterations in synapse morphology, active zone size and neurotransmission, and simultaneous loss of dysc and slo does not enhance these phenotypes, suggesting that dysc and slo act in a common genetic pathway to modulate synaptic development and output. Our data expand our understanding of the neuronal functions of DYSC and uncover non-canonical roles for the SLO potassium channel at Drosophila synapses.",2014,"Sylvain J le Marchand, Mark N Wu, Kyunghee Koh, Die Liu, Matthew B Dalva, Mohammed Shahidullah, James E C Jepson, Irwin B Levitan, Sha Liu"

We verified how live yeast supplementation affected body mass characteristics, total lipids and proteins, metabolic profiles and cold tolerance (acute and chronic stress). Females fed with live yeast had increased body mass and contained more lipids and proteins. Using GC/MS profiling, we found distinct metabolic fingerprints according to nutritional conditions.

Serotonin and downstream leucokinin neurons modulate larval turning behavior in Drosophila,24523545,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3500-13.2014,"Serotonin (5-HT) is known to modulate motor outputs in a variety of animal behaviors. However, the downstream neural pathways of 5-HT remain poorly understood. We studied the role of 5-HT in directional change, or turning, behavior of fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) larvae. We analyzed light- and touch-induced turning and found that turning is a combination of three components: bending, retreating, and rearing. Serotonin transmission suppresses rearing; when we inhibited 5-HT neurons with Shibire or Kir2.1, rearing increased without affecting the occurrence of bending or retreating. Increased rearing in the absence of 5-HT transmission often results in slower or failed turning, indicating that suppression of rearing by 5-HT is critical for successful turning. We identified a class of abdominal neurons called the abdominal LK neurons (ABLKs), which express the 5-HT1B receptor and the neuropeptide leucokinin, as downstream targets of 5-HT that are involved in the control of turning. Increased rearing was observed when neural transmission or leucokinin synthesis was inhibited in these cells. Forced activation of ABLKs also increased rearing, suggesting that an appropriate level of ABLK activity is critical for the control of turning. Calcium imaging revealed that ABLKs show periodic activation with an interval of ∼15 s. The activity level of ABLKs increased and decreased in response to a 5-HT agonist and antagonist, respectively. Our results suggest that 5-HT modulates larval turning by regulating the activity level of downstream ABLK neurons and secretion of the neuropeptide leucokinin.",2014,"Satoko Okusawa, Akinao Nose, Hiroshi Kohsaka"
Dopaminergic modulation of cAMP drives nonlinear plasticity across the Drosophila mushroom body lobes,24684937,10.1016/j.cub.2014.03.021,"Background: Activity of dopaminergic neurons is necessary and sufficient to evoke learning-related plasticity in neuronal networks that modulate learning. During olfactory classical conditioning, large subsets of dopaminergic neurons are activated, releasing dopamine across broad sets of postsynaptic neurons. It is unclear how such diffuse dopamine release generates the highly localized patterns of plasticity required for memory formation. Results: Here we have mapped spatial patterns of dopaminergic modulation of intracellular signaling and plasticity in Drosophila mushroom body (MB) neurons, combining presynaptic thermogenetic stimulation of dopaminergic neurons with postsynaptic functional imaging in vivo. Stimulation of dopaminergic neurons generated increases in cyclic AMP (cAMP) across multiple spatial regions in the MB. However, odor presentation paired with stimulation of dopaminergic neurons evoked plasticity in Ca(2+) responses in discrete spatial patterns. These patterns of plasticity correlated with behavioral requirements for each set of MB neurons in aversive and appetitive conditioning. Finally, broad elevation of cAMP differentially facilitated responses in the gamma lobe, suggesting that it is more sensitive to elevations of cAMP and that it is recruited first into dopamine-dependent memory traces. Conclusions: These data suggest that the spatial pattern of learning-related plasticity is dependent on the postsynaptic neurons' sensitivity to cAMP signaling. This may represent a mechanism through which single-cycle conditioning allocates short-term memory to a specific subset of eligible neurons (gamma neurons).",2014,"Tamara Boto, Seth M Tomchik, Kees Jalink, Kantiya Jindachomthong, Thierry Louis"
Knockdown of TrkA in cumulus oocyte complexes (COCs) inhibits EGF-induced cumulus expansion by down-regulation of IL-6,24215827,10.1016/j.mce.2013.10.031,"Tyrosine kinase receptor A (TrkA), the high-affinity receptor of nerve growth factor (NGF), is known to play key roles in ovarian follicular development, such as assembly of early follicles and follicular ovulation. However, little is known about the roles of TrkA in cumulus oocyte complex (COC) expansion. In this study, we found that TrkA was abundant in large antral follicles and knockdown of TrkA in COCs attenuated epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced COC expansion and further decreased the ovulation rate. The effect of TrkA on COC expansion was not mediated through downstream EGF effectors, phosphorylation of extracellular regulated protein kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) or drosophila mothers against decapentaplegic protein (SMAD), or through up-regulation of COC expansion-related transcripts such as prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (Ptgs2), hyaluronan synthase 2 (Has2), TNF-induced protein 6 (Tnfaip6) or pentraxin 3 (Ptx3). However, pharmacological blockade of TrkA transducing activity (K252α) in COCs decreased the mRNA expression and protein secretion of interleukin-6 (IL-6), identified from mRNA microarray of K252α-treated COCs. Meanwhile, knockdown of IL-6 attenuated EGF-induced COC expansion. In addition, IL-6 rescued the inhibitory effect of K252α on EGF-induced cumulus expansion. Therefore, IL-6 may act as a new potential cumulus expansion-related transcript, which may be involved in the integration of TrkA and EGF signaling in affecting COC expansion. Here, we provide mechanistic insights into the roles of TrkA in EGF-induced cumulus expansion.

Switching between humoral and cellular immune responses in Drosophila is guided by the cytokine GBP,25130174,10.1038/ncomms5628,"Insects combat infection through carefully measured cellular (for example, phagocytosis) and humoral (for example, secretion of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs)) innate immune responses.

Here, we use insect plasmatocytes and hemocyte-like Drosophila S2 cells to characterize mechanisms of immunity that operate in the haemocoel. We demonstrate that a Drosophila cytokine, growth-blocking peptides (GBP), acts through the phospholipase C (PLC)/Ca(2+) signalling cascade to mediate the secretion of Pvf, a ligand for platelet-derived growth factor- and vascular endothelial growth factor-receptor (Pvr) homologue. Activated Pvr recruits extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase to inhibit humoral immune responses, while stimulating cell 'spreading', an initiating event in cellular immunity. The double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-targeted knockdown of either Pvf2 or Pvr inhibits GBP-mediated cell spreading and activates AMP expression.

A mitochondrial-associated link between an effector caspase and autophagic flux,25126735,10.4161/auto.32170,"It has become evident that caspases function in nonapoptotic cellular processes in addition to the canonical role for caspases in apoptotic cell death. We recently demonstrated that the Drosophila effector caspase Dcp-1 localizes to the mitochondria and positively regulates starvation-induced autophagic flux during mid-oogenesis. Loss of Dcp-1 leads to elongation of the mitochondrial network, increased levels of the adenine nucleotide translocase sesB, increased ATP levels, and a reduction in autophagy. We found that sesB is a negative regulator of autophagic flux, and Dcp-1 interacts with sesB in a nonproteolytic manner to regulate its stability, uncovering a novel mechanism of mitochondrial associated, caspase-mediated regulation of autophagy in vivo.",2014,"Sharon M Gorski, Lindsay DeVorkin"
Aging induced endoplasmic reticulum stress alters sleep and sleep homeostasis,24444805,10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2013.12.005,"Alterations in the quality, quantity, and architecture of baseline and recovery sleep have been shown to occur during aging. Sleep deprivation induces endoplasmic reticular (ER) stress and upregulates a protective signaling pathway termed the unfolded protein response. The effectiveness of the adaptive unfolded protein response is diminished by age. Previously, we showed that endogenous chaperone levels altered recovery sleep in Drosophila melanogaster. We now report that acute administration of the chemical chaperone sodium 4-phenylbutyrate (PBA) reduces ER stress and ameliorates age-associated sleep changes in Drosophila. PBA consolidates both baseline and recovery sleep in aging flies. The behavioral modifications of PBA are linked to its suppression of ER stress. PBA decreased splicing of X-box binding protein 1 and upregulation of phosphorylated elongation initiation factor 2 α, in flies that were subjected to sleep deprivation. We also demonstrate that directly activating ER stress in young flies fragments baseline sleep and alters recovery sleep. Alleviating prolonged or sustained ER stress during aging contributes to sleep consolidation and improves recovery sleep or sleep debt discharge.",2014,"Nirinjini Naidoo, Allan I Pack, John E Zimmerman, May T Chan, Marishka K Brown, Nicholas E Jackson"
Evolution of a cellular immune response in Drosophila: a phenotypic and genomic comparative analysis,24443439,10.1093/gbe/evu012,"Understanding the genomic basis of evolutionary adaptation requires insight into the molecular basis underlying phenotypic variation. However, even changes in molecular pathways associated with extreme variation, gains and losses of specific phenotypes, remain largely uncharacterized. Here, we investigate the large interspecific differences in the ability to survive infection by parasitoids across 11 Drosophila species and identify genomic changes associated with gains and losses of parasitoid resistance. We show that a cellular immune defense, encapsulation, and the production of a specialized blood cell, lamellocytes, are restricted to a sublineage of Drosophila, but that encapsulation is absent in one species of this sublineage, Drosophila sechellia. Our comparative analyses of hemopoiesis pathway genes and of genes differentially expressed during the encapsulation response revealed that hemopoiesis-associated genes are highly conserved and present in all species independently of their resistance. In contrast, 11 genes that are differentially expressed during the response to parasitoids are novel genes, specific to the Drosophila sublineage capable of lamellocyte-mediated encapsulation. These novel genes, which are predominantly expressed in hemocytes, arose via duplications, whereby five of them also showed signatures of positive selection, as expected if they were recruited for new functions. Three of these novel genes further showed large-scale and presumably loss-of-function sequence changes in D. sechellia, consistent with the loss of resistance in this species. In combination, these convergent lines of evidence suggest that co-option of duplicated genes in existing pathways and subsequent neofunctionalization are likely to have contributed to the evolution of the lamellocyte-mediated encapsulation in Drosophila.",2014,"Bregje Wertheim, Angeliki Paspati, Louis van de Zande, Tanja Schwander, Laura Salazar-Jaramillo, Cornelis Joseph Vermeulen"
Function of the nuclear receptor FTZ-F1 during the pupal stage in Drosophila melanogaster,24611773,10.1111/dgd.12125,"The nuclear receptor βFTZ-F1 is expressed in most cells in a temporally specific manner, and its expression is induced immediately after decline in ecdysteroid levels. This factor plays important roles during embryogenesis, larval ecdysis, and early metamorphic stages. However, little is known about the expression pattern, regulation and function of this receptor during the pupal stage. We analyzed the expression pattern and regulation of ftz-f1 during the pupal period, as well as the phenotypes of RNAi knockdown or mutant animals, to elucidate its function during this stage. Western blotting revealed that βFTZ-F1 is expressed at a high level during the late pupal stage, and this expression is dependent on decreasing ecdysteroid levels. By immunohistological analysis of the late pupal stage, FTZ-F1 was detected in the nuclei of most cells, but cytoplasmic localization was observed only in the oogonia and follicle cells of the ovary. Both the ftz-f1 genetic mutant and temporally specific ftz-f1 knockdown using RNAi during the pupal stage showed defects in eclosion and in the eye, the antennal segment, the wing and the leg, including bristle color and sclerosis. These results suggest that βFTZ-F1 is expressed in most cells at the late pupal stage, under the control of ecdysteroids and plays important roles during pupal development.",2014,"Yasuhiro Oish, Abdel-Rahman S Sultan, Hitoshi Ueda"
Identification of important positions within miRNAs by integrating sequential and structural features,25135674,10.2174/138920371506140818112552,"MicroRNA(miRNA) is a small, single stranded non-coding RNA which plays an important regulatory role in gene expression. Additionally, miRNAs perform crucial functions in a wide range of biological processes. These functions may be exploited for miRNA-mediated regulation of protein-protein interaction and thus protein function. Many computational methods have been developed to predict the miRNA targets and to explore the regulatory mechanism between miRNA and protein. However, the efforts to investigate important positions within miRNAs are not comprehensive. This paper presents a framework to identify important positions using collision entropy. The information of contained in the sequence and secondary structure of miRNAs is considered. Further, the single base collision entropy and the adjacent base related collision entropy are integrated to measure the importance of miRNA position. Two thresholds are employed to select those positions with more biological meaning. A dataset of Drosophila melanogaster is used in the experiments. The results demonstrate that our approach can find interesting and important positions within miRNAs and may lead to a better understanding of miRNA biogenesis and function.",2014,"Scott Mann, Baoshan Chen, Qingfeng Chen, Taoshen Li, Changan Yuan, Wei Lan"
Low temperature reveals genetic variability against male-killing Spiroplasma in Drosophila melanogaster natural populations,24121800,10.1007/s00248-013-0295-z,"Spiroplasma endosymbionts are maternally inherited microorganisms which infect many arthropod species. In some Drosophila species, it acts as a reproductive manipulator, spreading in populations by killing the sons of infected mothers. Distinct Drosophila melanogaster populations from Brazil exhibit variable male-killing Spiroplasma prevalences. In this study, we investigated the presence of variability for the male-killing phenotype among Drosophila and/or Spiroplasma strains and verified if it correlates with the endosymbiont prevalence in natural populations. For that, we analyzed the male-killing expression when Spiroplasma strains from different populations were transferred to a standard D. melanogaster line (Canton-S) and when a common Spiroplasma strain was transferred to different wild-caught D. melanogaster lines, both at optimal and challenging temperatures for the bacteria. No variation was observed in the male-killing phenotype induced by different Spiroplasma strains. No phenotypic variability among fly lines was detected at optimal temperature (23 °C), as well. Conversely, significant variation in the male-killing expression was revealed among D. melanogaster lines at 18.5 °C, probably caused by imperfect transmission of the endosymbiont. Distinct lines differed in their average sex ratios as well as in the pattern of male-killing expression as the infected females aged. Greater variation occurred among lines from one locality, although there was no clear correlation between the male-killing intensity and the endosymbiont prevalence in each population. Imperfect transmission or male killing may also occur in the field, thus helping to explain the low or intermediate prevalences reported in nature. We discuss the implications of our results for the dynamics of male-killing Spiroplasma in natural populations.",2014,"Thais Costa, Iuri Matteuzzo Ventura, Louis Bernard Klaczko"
Transcriptional activation of the insulin-like growth factor I receptor gene by the Kruppel-like factor 6 (KLF6) tumor suppressor protein: potential interactions between KLF6 and p53,15131018,10.1210/en.2004-0173,"The IGF system plays an important role in prostate cancer initiation and progression. Most of the biological actions of IGF-I and IGF-II are mediated by activation of the IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR). Evidence accumulated in recent years indicates that acquisition of the malignant phenotype is initially IGF-IR dependent, but progression toward metastatic stages is usually associated with a decrease in IGF-IR levels. The Kruppel-like factor 6 (KLF6) is a zinc finger-containing transcription factor that was shown to be mutated in a significant portion of prostate and other types of cancer. To examine the potential regulation of IGF-IR gene expression by KLF6, we measured KLF6 levels in prostate-derived cell lines displaying different levels of IGF-IR. The results of Western analysis showed that KLF6 levels were higher in nontumorigenic P69 cells expressing high IGF-IR levels than in metastatic M12 cells containing reduced IGF-IR levels. Transient coexpression of wild-type, but not mutated, KLF6 together with an IGF-IR promoter-luciferase reporter plasmid resulted in an approximately 3.4-fold stimulation of IGF-IR promoter activity. Furthermore, KLF6 expression induced a significant increment in endogenous IGF-IR levels. Deletion analysis of the IGF-IR promoter revealed that a cluster of four GC boxes located between nucleotides -399 and -331 mediates a significant portion of the transactivating effect of KLF6. KLF6, although unable to stimulate IGF-IR promoter activity in Sp1-null Drosophila-derived Schneider cells, significantly enhanced the effect of Sp1. To assess the potential interactions between KLF6 and p53 in the regulation of IGF-IR gene expression, transfections were performed in the colorectal cancer cell line HCT116(+/+), which expresses p53, and its HCT116(-/-) derivative, which lacks p53. KLF6 exhibited an enhanced activity in p53-containing, compared with p53-null, cells. In addition, we were able to detect a physical interaction between KLF6 and p53. In summary, we have identified the IGF-IR gene as a novel downstream target for transcription factor KLF6.

The Drosophila F box protein archipelago regulates dMyc protein levels in vivo,15182669,10.1016/j.cub.2004.04.040,"Background: The Myc oncoprotein is an important regulator of cellular growth in metazoan organisms. Its levels and activity are tightly controlled in vivo by a variety of mechanisms. In normal cells, Myc protein is rapidly degraded, but the mechanism of its degradation is not well understood. Results: Here we present genetic and biochemical evidence that Archipelago (Ago), the F box component of an SCF-ubiquitin ligase and the Drosophila ortholog of a human tumor suppressor, negatively regulates the levels and activity of Drosophila Myc (dMyc) protein in vivo. Mutations in archipelago (ago) result in strongly elevated dMyc protein levels and increased tissue growth. Genetic interactions indicate that ago antagonizes dMyc function during development. Archipelago binds dMyc and regulates its stability, and the ability of Ago to bind dMyc in vitro correlates with its ability to inhibit dMyc accumulation in vivo. Conclusions: Our data indicate that archipelago is an important inhibitor of dMyc in developing tissues. Because archipelago can also regulate Cyclin E levels and Notch activity, these results indicate how a single F box protein can be responsible for the degradation of key components of multiple pathways that control growth and cell cycle progression.",2004,"Alexey Veraksa, Iswar K Hariharan, Ashim Mukherjee, Kenneth H Moberg, Spyros Artavanis-Tsakonas"
The integrin effector PINCH regulates JNK activity and epithelial migration in concert with Ras suppressor 1,15596544,10.1083/jcb.200408090,"Cell adhesion and migration are dynamic processes requiring the coordinated action of multiple signaling pathways, but the mechanisms underlying signal integration have remained elusive. Drosophila embryonic dorsal closure (DC) requires both integrin function and c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling for opposed epithelial sheets to migrate, meet, and suture. Here, we show that PINCH, a protein required for integrin-dependent cell adhesion and actin-membrane anchorage, is present at the leading edge of these migrating epithelia and is required for DC. By analysis of native protein complexes, we identify RSU-1, a regulator of Ras signaling in mammalian cells, as a novel PINCH binding partner that contributes to PINCH stability. Mutation of the gene encoding RSU-1 results in wing blistering in Drosophila, demonstrating its role in integrin-dependent cell adhesion. Genetic interaction analyses reveal that both PINCH and RSU-1 antagonize JNK signaling during DC.

Nondisjunction of the sex and the fourth chromosomes in male meiosis was scored as a mutant phenotype. We screened 2306 mutagenized and 226 natural population-derived second and third chromosomes and obtained seven mutants representing different loci on the second chromosome and one on the third.

We now show that the absence of SOD1 increases spontaneous genomic damage. The increase in spontaneous mutation rate occurs in SOD1-null mutants in somatic cells as well as in the germ line.

Mutations in sticky lead to defective organization of the contractile ring during cytokinesis and are enhanced by Rho and suppressed by Rac,15240570,10.1083/jcb.200402157,"The contractile ring is a highly dynamic structure, but how this dynamism is accomplished remains unclear. Here, we report the identification and analysis of a novel Drosophila gene, sticky (sti), essential for cytokinesis in all fly proliferating tissues. sti encodes the Drosophila orthologue of the mammalian Citron kinase. RNA interference-mediated silencing of sti in cultured cells causes them to become multinucleate. Components of the contractile ring and central spindle are recruited normally in such STICKY-depleted cells that nevertheless display asymmetric furrowing and aberrant blebbing. Together with an unusual distribution of F-actin and Anillin, these phenotypes are consistent with defective organization of the contractile ring. sti shows opposite genetic interactions with Rho and Rac genes suggesting that these GTPases antagonistically regulate STICKY functions. Similar genetic evidence indicates that RacGAP50C inhibits Rac during cytokinesis.

In two genetic models, Candida albicans and Drosophila melanogaster, Pin1 participates in distinct developmental processes regulated by the MAPK pathway. Pin1-deficient mice exhibit decreased primordial germ cell proliferation during embryonic development, along with several degenerative or proliferative defects in the adult testis, retina, mammary gland, and brain. The combination of primordial germ cell deficit and spermatogonial depletion contributes to severe fertility defects in Pin1-null mice.

The Drosophila Mre11/Rad50 complex is required to prevent both telomeric fusion and chromosome breakage,15296753,10.1016/j.cub.2004.07.019,"The MRN complex consists of the two evolutionarily conserved components Mre11 and Rad50 and the third less-conserved component Nbs1/Xrs2. This complex mediates telomere maintenance in addition to a variety of functions in response to DNA double-strand breaks, including homologous recombination, nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), and activation of DNA damage checkpoints. Mutations in the Mre11 gene cause the human ataxia-telangiectasia-like disorder (ATDL). Here, we show that null mutations in the Drosophila mre11 and rad50 genes cause both telomeric fusion and chromosome breakage. Moreover, we demonstrate that these mutations are in the same epistasis group required for telomere capping and mitotic chromosome integrity. Using an antibody against Rad50, we show that this protein is uniformly distributed along mitotic chromosomes, and that Rad50 is unstable in the absence of its binding partner Mre11. To define the roles of rad50 and mre11 in telomere protection, mutant chromosome preparations were immunostained for both HP1 and HOAP, two proteins that protect Drosophila telomeres from fusion. Cytological analysis revealed that mutations in rad50 and mre11 drastically reduce accumulation of HOAP and HP1 at telomeres.

How can a given class of ORN axons match up with a given class of PN dendrites? Here, we examine the cellular and developmental events that lead to this wiring specificity. We find that, before ORN axon arrival, PN dendrites have already created a prototypic map that resembles the adult glomerular map, by virtue of their selective dendritic localization. Positional cues that create this prototypic dendritic map do not appear to be either from the residual larval olfactory system or from glial processes within the antennal lobe.

Wolbachia, which are found in a variety of invertebrate species, are of great interest due to their diverse interactions with different hosts, which range from many forms of reproductive parasitism to mutualistic symbioses. Analysis of the wMel genome, in particular phylogenomic comparisons with other intracellular bacteria, has revealed many insights into the biology and evolution of wMel and Wolbachia in general. For example, the wMel genome is unique among sequenced obligate intracellular species in both being highly streamlined and containing very high levels of repetitive DNA and mobile DNA elements. This observation, coupled with multiple evolutionary reconstructions, suggests that natural selection is somewhat inefficient in wMel, most likely owing to the occurrence of repeated population bottlenecks. Genome analysis predicts many metabolic differences with the closely related Rickettsia species, including the presence of intact glycolysis and purine synthesis, which may compensate for an inability to obtain ATP directly from its host, as Rickettsia can. Other discoveries include the apparent inability of wMel to synthesize lipopolysaccharide and the presence of the most genes encoding proteins with ankyrin repeat domains of any prokaryotic genome yet sequenced. Despite the ability of wMel to infect the germline of its host, we find no evidence for either recent lateral gene transfer between wMel and D. melanogaster or older transfers between Wolbachia and any host. Evolutionary analysis further supports the hypothesis that mitochondria share a common ancestor with the alpha-Proteobacteria, but shows little support for the grouping of mitochondria with species in the order Rickettsiales.

Recently, atypical members of the soluble guanylyl cyclase family have been described that include the rat beta2 subunit and MsGC-beta3 from Manduca sexta. Predictions from the Drosophila melanogaster genome identify three atypical guanylyl cyclase subunits: Gyc-88E (formerly CG4154), Gyc-89Da (formerly CG14885) and Gyc-89Db (formerly CG14886). Preliminary data showed that transient expression of Gyc-88E in heterologous cells generated enzyme activity in the absence of additional subunits that was slightly stimulated by the NO donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP) but not the NO donor DEA-NONOate or the NO-independent activator YC-1. Gyc-89Db was inactive when expressed alone but when co-expressed with Gyc-88E enhanced the basal and SNP-stimulated activity of Gyc-88E, suggesting that they may form heterodimers in vivo.

We also show that there are two splice variants of Gyc-88E that differ by seven amino acids, although no differences in biochemical properties could be determined.

Structural and kinetic data also suggest that two substrate molecules can attach at the same time to the free, as well as to the acetylated, enzyme. We present a procedure which provides an unbiased framework for mathematical modelling of such complex reaction mechanisms. It is based on regression analysis of a rational polynomial using classical initial rate data. The determination of polynomial degree reveals the number of independent parameters that can be evaluated from the available information. Once determined, these parameters can substantially facilitate the construction and evaluation of a kinetic model reflecting the expected molecular events in an enzymic reaction.

In Drosophila, H3-K9 di- and trimethylation is mainly controlled by the heterochromatic SU(VAR)3-9 HMTase, a major regulator of position-effect variegation (PEV). In contrast, H3-K27 methylation states are independently mediated by the Pc-group enzyme E(Z). Isolation of 19 point mutants demonstrates that the silencing potential of Su(var)3-9 increases with its associated HMTase activity. A hyperactive Su(var)3-9 mutant, pitkin(D), displays extensive H3-K9 di- and trimethylation within but also outside pericentric heterochromatin. Notably, mutations in a novel Su(var) gene, Su(var)3-1, severely restrict Su(var)3-9-mediated gene silencing. Su(var)3-1 was identified as ""antimorphic"" mutants of the euchromatic H3-S10 kinase JIL-1.

Our data provide evidence for a dynamic balance between heterochromatin and euchromatin, and define two distinct mechanisms for Su(var) gene function. Whereas the majority of Su(var)s encode inherent components of heterochromatin that can establish repressive chromatin structures [intrinsic Su(var)s], Su(var)3-1 reflects gain-of-function mutants of a euchromatic component that antagonize the expansion of heterochromatic subdomains [acquired Su(var)s].",2004,"Sandro Lein, Veiko Krauss, Gunnar Schotta, Anja Ebert, Stefan Kubicek, Thomas Jenuwein, Gunter Reuter"

There was variation in the P element-related phenotypes among local populations, but genomic P composition did not correlate strongly with the phenotype of each line: full-size P and KP elements predominated in their genomes (FP+ KP predominance). Comparison with previous results suggests a stability in the P-M system in local populations over about 15 years. In some populations, phenotypic stability for particularly long times was found: for 30 years or more Q strains predominated in Hikone and Tanushimaru, P or Q strains around Inakadate, and M' or Q strains around Tozukawa. There was no clear evidence of structural destruction underlying functional variation of P elements during this period.

In this paper, we present prediction and additional experimental data that validate TPPP/p25 to be a new member of the ""intrinsically unstructured"" protein family. The comparison of these characteristics with that of alpha-synuclein and tau, involved also in neurodegenerative diseases, suggested that although the primary sequences of these proteins are entirely different, there are similarities in their well-defined unstructured segments interrupted by ""stabilization centres"", phosphorylation and tubulin binding motives. SK-N-MC neuroblastoma cells were transfected with pEGFP-TPPP/p25 construct and a stable clone denoted K4 was selected and used to establish the effect of this unstructured protein on the energy state/metabolism of the cells. Our data by analyzing the mitochondrial membrane polarization by fluorescence microscopy revealed that the high-energy phosphate production in K4 clone is not damaged by the TPPP/p25 expression. Biochemical analysis with cell homogenates provided quantitative data that the ATP level increased 1.5-fold and the activities of hexokinase, glucosephosphate isomerase, phosphofructokinase, triosephosphate isomerase and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were 1.2 to 2.0-fold higher in K4 as compared to the control. Our modelling using these data and rate equations of the individual enzymes suggests that the TPPP/p25 expression stimulates glucose metabolism. At pathological conditions TPPP/p25 is localized in inclusion bodies in multiple system atrophy, it tightly co-localizes with alpha-synuclein, partially with tubulin and not with vimentin. The previous and the present studies obtained with immunohistochemistry with pathological human brain tissues rendered it possible to classify among pathological inclusions on the basis of immunolabelling of TPPP/p25, and suggest this protein to be a potential linkage between Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases.",2004,"O Vincze, A Lehotzky, G G Kovács, J Ovádi, F Orosz, J Oláh"

Functional studies on the ligand-binding domain of Ultraspiracle from Drosophila melanogaster,14977043,10.1515/BC.2004.004,"The functional insect ecdysteroid receptor is comprised of the ecdysone receptor (EcR) and Ultraspiracle (USP). The ligand-binding domain (LBD) of USP was fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (GAL4-DBD) and characterized by analyzing the effect of site-directed mutations in the LBD. Normal and mutant proteins were tested for ligand and DNA binding, dimerization, and their ability to induce gene expression. The presence of helix 12 proved to be essential for DNA binding and was necessary to confer efficient ecdysteroid binding to the heterodimer with the EcR (LBD), but did not influence dimerization. The antagonistic position of helix 12 is indispensible for interaction between the fusion protein and DNA, whereas hormone binding to the EcR (LBD) was only partially reduced if fixation of helix 12 was disturbed. The mutation of amino acids, which presumably bind to a fatty acid evoked a profound negative influence on transactivation ability, although enhanced transactivation potency and ligand binding to the ecdysteroid receptor was impaired to varying degrees by mutation of these residues. Mutations of one fatty acid-binding residue within the ligand-binding pocket, 1323, however, evoked enhanced transactivation. The results confirmed that the LBD of Ultraspiracle modifies ecdysteroid receptor function through intermolecular interactions and demonstrated that the ligand-binding pocket of USP modifies the DNA-binding and transactivation abilities of the fusion protein.",2004,"William W Hitchcock, Vincent C Henrich, Sabina Przibilla, Marco Grebe, Joshua Beatty, Mihaly Szécsi, Margarethe Spindler-Barth"

Our molecular characterization of the patterning defects associated with the mutation reveals abnormalities in two major signaling pathways, the grk/Egfr and the Dpp/TGF-beta, that together control the elaborate patterning of the anterior follicular epithelium. The function of spoonbill appears to be required for dpp transcription in a specialized population of follicle cells and for the selective transport of grk mRNA from the nurse cells into the oocyte, as well as for its proper localization and translation.

Synaptic vesicles: test for a role in presynaptic calcium regulation,15014125,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5372-03.2004,"Membrane-bound organelles such as mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum play an important role in neuronal Ca(2+) homeostasis. Synaptic vesicles (SVs), the organelles responsible for exocytosis of neurotransmitters, occupy more of the volume of presynaptic nerve terminals than any other organelle and, under some conditions, can accumulate Ca(2+). They are also closely associated with voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels (VGCCs) that trigger transmitter release by admitting Ca(2+) into the nerve terminal in response to action potentials (APs). We tested the hypothesis that SVs can modulate Ca(2+) signals in the presynaptic terminal. This has been a difficult question to address because neither pharmacological nor genetic approaches to block Ca(2+) permeation of the SV membrane have been available. To investigate the possible role of SVs in Ca(2+) regulation, we used imaging techniques to compare Ca(2+) dynamics in motor nerve terminals before and after depletion of SVs. We used the temperature-sensitive Drosophila dynamin mutant shibire, in which SVs can be eliminated by stimulation. There was no difference in the amplitude or time course of Ca(2+) responses during high-frequency trains of APs, or single APs, in individual presynaptic boutons before and after depletion of SVs. SVs have a limited role, if any, in the rapid sequestration of Ca(2+) within the neuronal cytosol or the synaptic microdomain. We also conclude that SVs are not important for regulation of synaptic VGCCs.",2004,"Milton P Charlton, Leo Marin, Harold L Atwood, Greg T Macleod"

Pygopus and Legless target Armadillo/beta-catenin to the nucleus to enable its transcriptional co-activator function,15208637,10.1038/ncb1141,"Wnt signalling controls the transcription of genes that function during normal and malignant development. Stimulation by canonical Wnt ligands activates beta-catenin (or Drosophila melanogaster Armadillo) by blocking its phosphorylation, resulting in its stabilization and translocation to the nucleus. Here, Armadillo/beta-catenin binds to TCF/LEF transcription factors and recruits chromatin-modifying and -remodelling complexes to transcribe Wnt target genes. The transcriptional activity of Armadillo/beta-catenin depends on two conserved nuclear proteins recently discovered in Drosophila, Pygopus (Pygo) and Legless/BCL-9 (Lgs). Lgs functions as an adaptor between Pygo and Armadillo/beta-catenin, but how Armadillo/beta-catenin is controlled by Pygo and Lgs is not known. Here, we show that the nuclear localization of Lgs entirely depends on Pygo, which itself is constitutively localized to the nucleus; thus, Pygo functions as a nuclear anchor. Pygo is also required for high nuclear Armadillo levels during Wingless signalling, and together with Lgs increases the transcriptional activity of beta-catenin in APC mutant cancer cells. Notably, linking Armadillo to a nuclear localization sequence rescues pygo and lgs mutant fly embryos. This indicates that Pygo and Lgs function in targeting Armadillo/beta-catenin to the nucleus, thus ensuring its availability to TCF during Wnt signalling.",2004,"Fiona M Townsley, Mariann Bienz, Adam Cliffe"

Species of Glossina differ in vector competence and Glossina morsitans morsitans is associated with transmission of Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, which causes an acute and often fatal form of African Trypanosomiasis. Heat shock proteins are evolutionarily conserved proteins that play critical roles in proteostasis. The activity of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) is regulated by interactions with its J-protein (Hsp40) co-chaperones. Inhibition of these interactions are emerging as potential therapeutic targets. The assembly and annotation of the G. m. morsitans genome provided a platform to identify and characterize the Hsp70s and J-proteins, and carry out an evolutionary comparison to its well-studied eukaryotic counterparts, Drosophila melanogaster and Homo sapiens, as well as Stomoxys calcitrans, a comparator species. In our study, we identified 9 putative Hsp70 proteins and 37 putative J-proteins in G. m. morsitans. Phylogenetic analyses revealed three evolutionarily distinct groups of Hsp70s, with a closer relationship to orthologues from its blood-feeding dipteran relative Stomoxys calcitrans.

The maternal haploid (mh) mutation in Drosophila affects this process and leads to the formation of haploid embryos without the paternal genome. mh encodes the Drosophila homolog of SPRTN, a conserved protease essential for resolving DNA-protein cross-linked products. Here we characterize the role of MH in genome maintenance. It is not understood how MH protects the paternal genome during fertilization, particularly in light of our finding that MH is present in both parental pronuclei during zygote formation. We showed that maternal chromosomes in mh mutant embryos experience instabilities in the absence of the paternal genome, which suggests that MH is generally required for chromosome stability during embryogenesis. This is consistent with our finding that MH is abundantly present on chromatin throughout the cell cycle. Remarkably, MH is prominently enriched at the 359-bp satellite repeats during interphase, which becomes unstable without MH. This dynamic localization and specific enrichment of MH at the 359 repeats resemble that of Topoisomerase 2 (Top2), suggesting that MH regulates Top2, possibly as a protease for the resolution of Top2-DNA intermediates. We propose that maternal MH removes proteins specifically enriched on sperm chromatin. In the absence of that function, paternal chromosomes are precipitously lost. This mode of paternal chromatin remodeling is likely conserved and the unique phenotype of the Drosophila mh mutants represents a rare opportunity to gain insights into the process that has been difficult to study.",2017,"Liang Zhang, Qianyi Zhang, Jinguo Cao, Yikang S Rong, Yingzi Huang, Xiaona Tang"
Overcoming evolved resistance to population-suppressing homing-based gene drives,28630470,10.1038/s41598-017-02744-7,"The recent development of a CRISPR-Cas9-based homing system for the suppression of Anopheles gambiae is encouraging; however, with current designs, the slow emergence of homing-resistant alleles is expected to result in suppressed populations rapidly rebounding, as homing-resistant alleles have a significant fitness advantage over functional, population-suppressing homing alleles. To explore this concern, we develop a mathematical model to estimate tolerable rates of homing-resistant allele generation to suppress a wild population of a given size. Our results suggest that, to achieve meaningful population suppression, tolerable rates of resistance allele generation are orders of magnitude smaller than those observed for current designs for CRISPR-Cas9-based homing systems. To remedy this, we theoretically explore a homing system architecture in which guide RNAs (gRNAs) are multiplexed, increasing the effective homing rate and decreasing the effective resistant allele generation rate. Modeling results suggest that the size of the population that can be suppressed increases exponentially with the number of multiplexed gRNAs and that, with four multiplexed gRNAs, a mosquito species could potentially be suppressed on a continental scale. We also demonstrate successful proof-of-principle use of multiplexed ribozyme flanked gRNAs to induce mutations in vivo in Drosophila melanogaster - a strategy that could readily be adapted to engineer stable, homing-based drives in relevant organisms.",2017,"John M Marshall, Héctor M Sánchez C, Omar S Akbari, Anna Buchman"

We demonstrate that retinal precursor cells that arrest in G2 during larval development are selected as sensory organ precursors (SOPs) during pupal development and undergo two cell divisions to generate the four-cell interommatidial mechanosensory bristles. While G2 arrest is not required for bristle development, preventing G2 arrest results in incorrect bristle positioning in the adult eye.

"Basal tolerance to heat and cold exposure of the spotted wing drosophila, Drosophila suzukii",28348931,10.7717/peerj.3112,"The spotted wing Drosophila, Drosophila suzukii, is a new pest in Europe and America which causes severe damages, mostly to stone fruit crops. Temperature and humidity are among the most important abiotic factors governing insect development and fitness. In many situations, temperature can become stressful thus compromising survival. The ability to cope with thermal stress depends on basal level of thermal tolerance. Basic knowledge on temperature-dependent mortality of D. suzukii is essential to facilitate management of this pest. The objective of the present study was to investigate D. suzukii basal cold and heat tolerance. Adults and pupae were subjected to six low temperatures (-5-7.5 °C) and seven high temperatures (30-37 °C) for various durations, and survival-time-temperature relationships were investigated. Data showed that males were globally more cold tolerant than females. At temperature above 5 °C, adult cold mortality became minor even after prolonged exposures (e.g., only 20% mortality after one month at 7.5 °C). Heat tolerance of males was lower than that of females at the highest tested temperatures (34, 35 and 37 °C). Pupae appeared much less cold tolerant than adults at all temperatures (e.g., Lt50 at 5° C: 4-5 d for adults vs. 21 h for pupae). Pupae were more heat tolerant than adults at the most extreme high temperatures (e.g., Lt50 at 37 °C: 30 min for adults vs. 4 h for pupae). The pupal thermal tolerance was further investigated under low vs. high humidity. Low relative humidity did not affect pupal cold survival, but it reduced survival under heat stress. Overall, this study shows that survival of D. suzukii under heat and cold conditions can vary with stress intensity, duration, humidity, sex and stage, and the methodological approach used here, which was based on thermal tolerance landscapes, provides a comprehensive description of D. suzukiithermal tolerance and limits.",2017,"Hervé Colinet, Thomas Enriquez"
The function of Drosophila larval class IV dendritic arborization sensory neurons in the larval-pupal transition is separable from their function in mechanical nociception responses,28910410,10.1371/journal.pone.0184950,"The sensory and physiological inputs which govern the larval-pupal transition in Drosophila, and the neuronal circuity that integrates them, are complex. Previous work from our laboratory identified a dosage-sensitive genetic interaction between the genes encoding the Rho-GEF Trio and the zinc-finger transcription factor Sequoia that interfered with the larval-pupal transition. Specifically, we reported heterozygous mutations in sequoia (seq) dominantly exacerbated the trio mutant phenotype, and this seq-enhanced trio mutant genotype blocked the transition of third instar larvae from foragers to wanderers, a requisite behavioral transition prior to pupation. In this work, we use the GAL4-UAS system to rescue this phenotype by tissue-specific trio expression. We find that expressing trio in the class IV dendritic arborization (da) sensory neurons rescues the larval-pupal transition, demonstrating the reliance of the larval-pupal transition on the integrity of these sensory neurons. As nociceptive responses also rely on the functionality of the class IV da neurons, we test mechanical nociceptive responses in our mutant and rescued larvae and find that mechanical nociception is separable from the ability to undergo the larval-pupal transition. This demonstrates for the first time that the roles of the class IV da neurons in governing two critical larval behaviors, the larval-pupal transition and mechanical nociception, are functionally separable from each other.",2017,"Hannah E Brown, Trishna Desai, Eric C Liebl, Zachary W Schmidt, Hannah Swahn, Harshida Pancholi, Allison J Murphy"

Cortactin Is a Regulator of Activity-Dependent Synaptic Plasticity Controlled by Wingless,28123080,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1375-16.2017,"Major signaling molecules initially characterized as key early developmental regulators are also essential for the plasticity of the nervous system. Previously, the Wingless (Wg)/Wnt pathway was shown to underlie the structural and electrophysiological changes during activity-dependent synaptic plasticity at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction. A challenge remains to understand how this signal mediates the cellular changes underlying this plasticity. Here, we focus on the actin regulator Cortactin, a major organizer of protrusion, membrane mobility, and invasiveness, and define its new role in synaptic plasticity. We show that Cortactin is present presynaptically and postsynaptically at the Drosophila NMJ and that it is a presynaptic regulator of rapid activity-dependent modifications in synaptic structure. Furthermore, animals lacking presynaptic Cortactin show a decrease in spontaneous release frequency, and presynaptic Cortactin is necessary for the rapid potentiation of spontaneous release frequency that takes place during activity-dependent plasticity. Most interestingly, Cortactin levels increase at stimulated synaptic terminals and this increase requires neuronal activity, de novo transcription and depends on Wg/Wnt expression. Because it is not simply the presence of Cortactin in the presynaptic terminal but its increase that is necessary for the full range of activity-dependent plasticity, we conclude that it probably plays a direct and important role in the regulation of this process.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT In the nervous system, changes in activity that lead to modifications in synaptic structure and function are referred to as synaptic plasticity and are thought to be the basis of learning and memory. The secreted Wingless/Wnt molecule is a potent regulator of synaptic plasticity in both vertebrates and invertebrates.

We demonstrate that neither loss of spatially coordinated apical constriction nor its complete blockage prevent internalization and tube formation, although such manipulations affect the geometry of invagination. When apical constriction is disrupted, compressing force generated by a tissue-level myosin cable contributes to SG invagination.

"upSET, the Drosophila homologue of SET3, Is Required for Viability and the Proper Balance of Active and Repressive Chromatin Marks",28064188,10.1534/g3.116.037788,"Chromatin plays a critical role in faithful implementation of gene expression programs. Different post-translational modifications (PTMs) of histone proteins reflect the underlying state of gene activity, and many chromatin proteins write, erase, bind, or are repelled by, these histone marks. One such protein is UpSET, the Drosophila homolog of yeast Set3 and mammalian KMT2E (MLL5). Here, we show that UpSET is necessary for the proper balance between active and repressed states. Using CRISPR/Cas-9 editing, we generated S2 cells that are mutant for upSET We found that loss of UpSET is tolerated in S2 cells, but that heterochromatin is misregulated, as evidenced by a strong decrease in H3K9me2 levels assessed by bulk histone PTM quantification. To test whether this finding was consistent in the whole organism, we deleted the upSET coding sequence using CRISPR/Cas-9, which we found to be lethal in both sexes in flies. We were able to rescue this lethality using a tagged upSET transgene, and found that UpSET protein localizes to transcriptional start sites (TSS) of active genes throughout the genome. Misregulated heterochromatin is apparent by suppressed position effect variegation of the wm4 allele in heterozygous upSET-deleted flies. Using nascent-RNA sequencing in the upSET-mutant S2 lines, we show that this result applies to heterochromatin genes generally.

Two digestive cathepsins L (TmCAL2 and TmCAL3) from it had their 3D structures solved. The aim of this paper was to study in details TmCAL3 specificity and properties and relate them to its 3D structure. Recombinant TmCAL3 was assayed with 64 oligopeptides with different amino acid replacements in positions P2, P1, P1' and P2'. Results showed that TmCAL3 S2 specificity differs from the human enzyme and that its specificities also explain why on autoactivation two propeptide residues remain in the enzyme. Data on free energy of binding and of activation showed that S1 and S2' are mainly involved in substrate binding, S1' acts in substrate binding and catalysis, whereas S2 is implied mainly in catalysis. Enzyme subsite residues were identified by docking with the same oligopeptide used for kinetics. The subsite hydrophobicities were calculated from the efficiency of hydrolysis of different amino acid replacements in the peptide and from docking data. The results were closer for S1 and S2' than for S1' and S2, indicating that the residue subsites that were more involved in transition state binding are different from those binding the substrate seen in docking. Besides TmCAL1-3, there are nine other cathepsins L, most of them more expressed at midgut. They are supposed to be directed to lysosomes by a Drosophila-like Lerp receptor and/or motifs in their prodomains.

Multi locus sequence typing (MLST) suggests presence of genetic homogeneity across wSuz strains infecting European and American D. suzukii populations, although different Wolbachia infection frequencies and host fecundity levels have been observed in both populations. Currently, it is not clear if these differences are due to cryptic wSuz polymorphism, host background, geographical factors or a combination of all of them. Here, we have identified geographical diversity in wSuz in D. suzukii populations from different continents using a highly diagnostic set of markers based on insertion sequence (IS) site polymorphism and genomic rearrangements (GR). We further identified inter-strain diversity between Wolbachia infecting D. suzukii and its sister species D. subpulchrella (wSpc). Based on our results, we speculate that discernible wSuz variants may associate with different observed host phenotypes, a hypothesis that demands future investigation. More generally, our results demonstrate the utility of IS and GRs in discriminating closely related Wolbachia strains.",2017,"Rupinder Kaur, Omar Rota-Stabelli, Wolfgang J Miller, Stefanos Siozios"
Identification of Genes that Maintain Behavioral and Structural Plasticity during Sleep Loss,29109678,10.3389/fncir.2017.00079,"Although patients with primary insomnia experience sleep disruption, they are able to maintain normal performance on a variety of cognitive tasks. This observation suggests that insomnia may be a condition where predisposing factors simultaneously increase the risk for insomnia and also mitigate against the deleterious consequences of waking. To gain insight into processes that might regulate sleep and buffer neuronal circuits during sleep loss, we manipulated three genes, fat facet (faf), highwire (hiw) and the GABA receptor Resistance to dieldrin (Rdl), that were differentially modulated in a Drosophila model of insomnia. Our results indicate that increasing faf and decreasing hiw or Rdl within wake-promoting large ventral lateral clock neurons (lLNvs) induces sleep loss. As expected, sleep loss induced by decreasing hiw in the lLNvs results in deficits in short-term memory and increases of synaptic growth. However, sleep loss induced by knocking down Rdl in the lLNvs protects flies from sleep-loss induced deficits in short-term memory and increases in synaptic markers. Surprisingly, decreasing hiw and Rdl within the Mushroom Bodies (MBs) protects against the negative effects of sleep deprivation (SD) as indicated by the absence of a subsequent homeostatic response, or deficits in short-term memory. Together these results indicate that specific genes are able to disrupt sleep and protect against the negative consequences of waking in a circuit dependent manner.",2017,"Paul J Shaw, Matthew Thimgan, Laurent Seugnet, Stephane Dissel, Lijuan Cao"
Genetic variants regulating expression levels and isoform diversity during embryogenesis,28024300,10.1038/nature20802,"Embryonic development is driven by tightly regulated patterns of gene expression, despite extensive genetic variation among individuals. Studies of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) indicate that genetic variation frequently alters gene expression in cell-culture models and differentiated tissues. However, the extent and types of genetic variation impacting embryonic gene expression, and their interactions with developmental programs, remain largely unknown. Here we assessed the effect of genetic variation on transcriptional (expression levels) and post-transcriptional (3' RNA processing) regulation across multiple stages of metazoan development, using 80 inbred Drosophila wild isolates, identifying thousands of developmental-stage-specific and shared QTL. Given the small blocks of linkage disequilibrium in Drosophila, we obtain near base-pair resolution, resolving causal mutations in developmental enhancers, validated transcription-factor-binding sites and RNA motifs. This fine-grain mapping uncovered extensive allelic interactions within enhancers that have opposite effects, thereby buffering their impact on enhancer activity. QTL affecting 3' RNA processing identify new functional motifs leading to transcript isoform diversity and changes in the lengths of 3' untranslated regions.

Adaptive Evolution Leads to Cross-Species Incompatibility in the piRNA Transposon Silencing Machinery,28919205,10.1016/j.devcel.2017.08.012,"Reproductive isolation defines species divergence and is linked to adaptive evolution of hybrid incompatibility genes. Hybrids between Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans are sterile, and phenocopy mutations in the PIWI interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway, which silences transposons and shows pervasive adaptive evolution, and Drosophila rhino and deadlock encode rapidly evolving components of a complex that binds to piRNA clusters. We show that Rhino and Deadlock interact and co-localize in simulans and melanogaster, but simulans Rhino does not bind melanogaster Deadlock, due to substitutions in the rapidly evolving Shadow domain. Significantly, a chimera expressing the simulans Shadow domain in a melanogaster Rhino backbone fails to support piRNA production, disrupts binding to piRNA clusters, and leads to ectopic localization to bulk heterochromatin. Fusing melanogaster Deadlock to simulans Rhino, by contrast, restores localization to clusters. Deadlock binding thus directs Rhino to piRNA clusters, and Rhino-Deadlock co-evolution has produced cross-species incompatibilities, which may contribute to reproductive isolation.",2017,"Zhiping Weng, William E Theurkauf, Swapnil S Parhad, Shikui Tu"
Strong epistatic and additive effects of linked candidate SNPs for Drosophila pigmentation have implications for analysis of genome-wide association studies results,28673357,10.1186/s13059-017-1262-7,"Background: The mapping resolution of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) is limited by historic recombination events and effects are often assigned to haplotype blocks rather than individual SNPs. It is not clear how many of the SNPs in the block, and which ones, are causative. Drosophila pigmentation is a powerful model to dissect the genetic basis of intra-specific and inter-specific phenotypic variation. Three tightly linked SNPs in the t-MSE enhancer have been identified in three D. melanogaster populations as major contributors to female abdominal pigmentation. This enhancer controls the expression of the pigmentation gene tan (t) in the abdominal epidermis. Two of the three SNPs were confirmed in an independent study using the D. melanogaster Genetic Reference Panel established from a North American population. Results: We determined the functional impact of SNP1, SNP2, and SNP3 using transgenic lines to test all possible haplotypes in vivo. We show that all three candidate SNPs contribute to female Drosophila abdominal pigmentation. Interestingly, only two SNPs agree with the effect predicted by GWAS; the third one goes in the opposite direction because of linkage disequilibrium between multiple functional SNPs. Our experimental design uncovered strong additive effects for the three SNPs, but we also found significant epistatic effects explaining up to 11% of the total variation. Conclusions: Our results suggest that linked causal variants are important for the interpretation of GWAS and functional validation is needed to understand the genetic architecture of traits.",2017,"Marlies Dolezal, Frédérique Peronnet, Christian Schlötterer, Jean-Michel Gibert, Viola Nolte, Jorge Blanco"
Genomewide Association Study of Alcohol Dependence Identifies Risk Loci Altering Ethanol-Response Behaviors in Model Organisms,28226201,10.1111/acer.13362,"Background: Alcohol dependence (AD) shows evidence for genetic liability, but genes influencing risk remain largely unidentified. Methods: We conducted a genomewide association study in 706 related AD cases and 1,748 unscreened population controls from Ireland. We sought replication in 15,496 samples of European descent. We used model organisms (MOs) to assess the role of orthologous genes in ethanol (EtOH)-response behaviors. We tested 1 primate-specific gene for expression differences in case/control postmortem brain tissue. Results: We detected significant association in COL6A3 and suggestive association in 2 previously implicated loci, KLF12 and RYR3. None of these signals are significant in replication. A suggestive signal in the long noncoding RNA LOC339975 is significant in case:control meta-analysis, but not in a population sample. Knockdown of a COL6A3 ortholog in Caenorhabditis elegans reduced EtOH sensitivity. Col6a3 expression correlated with handling-induced convulsions in mice. Loss of function of the KLF12 ortholog in C. elegans impaired development of acute functional tolerance (AFT). Klf12 expression correlated with locomotor activation following EtOH injection in mice. Loss of function of the RYR3 ortholog reduced EtOH sensitivity in C. elegans and rapid tolerance in Drosophila. The ryanodine receptor antagonist dantrolene reduced motivation to self-administer EtOH in rats. Expression of LOC339975 does not differ between cases and controls but is reduced in carriers of the associated rs11726136 allele in nucleus accumbens (NAc). Conclusions: We detect association between AD and COL6A3, KLF12, RYR3, and LOC339975. Despite nonreplication of COL6A3, KLF12, and RYR3 signals, orthologs of these genes influence behavioral response to EtOH in MOs, suggesting potential involvement in human EtOH response and AD liability.

"Gypsy/Ty3-class retrotransposons integrated in the DNA of herring, tunicate, and echinoderms",7714910,10.1007/BF00166592,"Eight new examples of retrotransposons of the Gypsy/Ty3 class have been identified in marine species. A 525-nt pol gene-coding region was amplified using degenerate primers from highly conserved regions and has extended the range of recognition of Gypsy/Ty3 far beyond those previously known. The following matrix shows the percentage AA divergence of the translations of this segment of the pol gene coding region. [table: see text] The underlines separate three groups of retrotransposons that can be recognized on the basis of this amino acid sequence. The new upper group shows surprising amino acid sequence similarity among members from the DNA of herring, sea urchin, starfish, and a tunicate. For example, the herring element differs by only 41% from the Ciona element and 46% from the sea urchin element. The group between the lines includes members close to previously known elements (marked by asterisks) and has so far been found only in sea urchins. The two upper groups differ from each other by 55-60% and yet members of both groups (e.g., Spr1 and Spr2) are integrated into the DNA of one species--S. purpuratus. Below the lower underline is listed the only known representative of a very distant group, which occurs in starfish DNA. In spite of large divergence, amino acid sequence comparisons indicate that all of the elements shown in the array are members of the LTR-containing class of retrotransposons that includes Gypsy of Drosophila and Ty3 of yeast. Of all known mobile elements this class shows the closest sequence similarity to retroviruses and has the same arrangement of genes as simpler retroviruses.",1995,"T J McCormack, E H Davidson, R J Britten, T L Mears"
The specificity of homeotic gene function,7487967,10.1002/bies.950171007,"How transcription factors achieve their in vivo specificities is a fundamental question in biology. For the Homeotic Complex (HOM/Hox) family of homeoproteins, specificity in vivo is likely to be in part determined by subtle differences in the DNA binding properties inherent in these proteins. Some of these differences in DNA binding are due to sequence differences in the N-terminal arms of HOM/Hox homeodomains. Evidence also exists to suggest that cofactors can modify HOM/Hox function by cooperative DNA binding interactions. The Drosophila homeoprotein extradenticle (exd) is likely to be one such cofactor. In HOM/Hox proteins, both the conserved 'YPWM' peptide motif and the homeodomain are important for interacting with exd. Although exd provides part of the answer as to how specificity is achieved, there may be additional cofactors and mechanisms that have yet to be identified.",1995,R S Mann
"Mutations in supernova, indicate that this gene is required for the division of germ line cells in Drosophila",28306120,10.1007/BF00208492,"Mutations in supernova, previously shown to uncouple chromosome replication from segregation during cleavage in Drosophila embryos, also sanctions extra divisions of cystoblasts and spermatoblasts. This leads either to the formation of egg chambers which contain more than fifteen nurse cells or testes which have an excess of spermatocytes. In maturing egg chambers two potential oocytes may be specified in which case they are often ectopically located and connected with surrounding nurse cells by four ring canals. However, a typical oocyte nucleus is not always present and these chambers usually become necrotic and degenerate. The nurse cells are of variable size, but are still interconnected by a system of ring canals. They all possess a polyploid nucleus. Sequestering of maternal mRNA's from the nurse cells into the potential oocyte(s) takes place but there is no localization of this maternal information within the oocyte probably because of defective microtubule assembly. Many spermatocytes fail to complete meiosis so that bundles of spermatids are reduced in size and the males have reduced fertility. It is proposed that this gene is indirectly involved in regulating the timing of mitotic divisions in both cystoblasts and spermatoblasts through its interference with microtubule assembly which is consistent with its role during embryogenesis.",1995,"L Billett, N G Brink"
Notch regulates wingless expression and is not required for reception of the paracrine wingless signal during wing margin neurogenesis in Drosophila,7555709,,"In the developing wing margin of Drosophila, wingless is normally expressed in a narrow stripe of cells adjacent to the proneural cells that form the sensory bristles of the margin. Previous work has shown that this wingless is required for the expression of the proneural achaete-scute complex genes and the subsequent formation of the sensory bristles along the margin; recently, it has been proposed that the proneural cells require the Notch protein to properly receive the wingless signal. We have used clonal analysis of a null allele of Notch to test this idea directly. We found that Notch was not required by prospective proneural margin cells for the expression of scute or the formation of sensory precursors, indicating Notch is not required for the reception of wingless signal. Loss of Notch from proneural cells produced cell-autonomous neurogenic phenotypes and precocious differentiation of sensory cells, as would be expected if Notch had a role in lateral inhibition within the proneural regions. However, loss of scute expression and of sensory precursors was observed if clones substantially included the normal region of wingless expression. These 'anti-proneural' phenotypes were associated with the loss of wingless expression; this loss may be partially or wholly responsible for the anti-proneural phenotype. Curiously, Notch- clones limited to the dorsal or ventral compartments could disrupt wingless expression and proneural development in the adjacent compartment. Analysis using the temperature-sensitive Notch allele indicated that the role of Notch in the regulation of wingless expression precedes the requirement for lateral inhibition in proneural cells. Furthermore, overexpression of wingless with a heat shock-wingless construct rescued the loss of sensory precursors associated with the early loss of Notch.",1995,"S S Blair, E J Rulifson"
"Trans-regulation of thoracic homeotic selector genes of the Antennapedia and bithorax complexes by the trithorax group genes: absent, small, and homeotic discs 1 and 2",8555105,10.1016/0925-4773(95)00430-0,"Genes of the trithorax group appear to be required for the maintenance of expression of the homeotic selector genes of the Antennapedia and bithorax complexes. According to genetic criteria, the Drosophila melanogaster genes absent, small, or homeotic discs 1 and 2 (ash1 and ash2) are members of the trithorax group. In this paper we examine the consequences of ash1 and ash2 mutations on the expression of homeotic selector genes in imaginal discs. The results of these experiments demonstrates that both ash1 and ash2 are trans-regulatory elements of homeotic selector gene regulation. Hypomorphic ash1 mutations cause variegated expression of Antennapedia, Sex combs reduced, Ultrabithorax, and engrailed. Complete loss of ash2 activity causes the loss of expression of Sex combs reduced in first leg imaginal discs, loss of expression of Ultrabithorax in third leg discs, and a late-patterned loss of expression of Ultrabithorax within haltere discs, yet has no effect on engrailed or Antennapedia expression.

We examined sequence elements of the Drosophila hsp70 promoter for their ability to facilitate the binding of the transcription factor, heat shock factor (HSF), to chromatin. We assayed HSF binding to various transgenic heat shock promoters in situ by measuring amounts of fluorescence at transgenic loci of polytene chromosomes that were stained with an HSF antibody. We found three promoter sequences that influence the access of HSF to its binding sites: the GAGA element, sequences surrounding the transcription start site, and a region in the leader of hsp70 where RNA polymerase II arrests during early elongation. The GAGA element has been shown previously to disrupt nucleosome structure. Because the two other critical regions include sequences that are required for stable binding of TFIID in vitro, we examined the in vivo occupancy of the TATA elements in the transgenic promoters. We found that TATA occupancy correlated with HSF binding for some promoters. However, in all cases HSF accessibility correlated with the presence of paused RNA polymerase II. We propose that a complex promoter architecture is established by multiple interdependent factors, including GAGA factor, TFIID, and RNA polymerase II, and that this structure is critical for HSF binding in vivo.",1995,"J T Lis, M Fernandes, K Hirayoshi, L S Shopland"
"Cloning and characterization of hTAFII18, hTAFII20 and hTAFII28: three subunits of the human transcription factor TFIID",7729427,,"We have cloned cDNAs encoding three novel TAFIIs [TATA-binding protein (TBP)-associated factors] from the human (h) HeLa cell TFIID complexes hTAFII28, hTAFII20 and hTAFII18. hTAFII28 is a core hTAFII present in both of the previously described hTFIID species which either lack or contain hTAFII30 (hTFIID alpha and hTFIID beta respectively), and is the homologue of Drosophila (d)TAFII30 beta. hTAFII18 is a novel hTAFII which shows homology to the N-terminal region of the yeast TAFIISPT3, but has no known Drosophila counterpart. In contrast to hTAFII28, hTAFII18 is a TFIID beta-specific hTAFII. hTAFII20 is the homologue of p22, an alternatively spliced form of dTAFII30 alpha (p32). Using a combination of protein affinity chromatography and cotransfection and immunoprecipitation assays, we have identified a series of in vitro and intracellular interactions among the novel hTAFIIs and between the novel hTAFIIs and hTAFII30 or TBP. We show that hTAFII28 interacts with hTAFII18 both in vitro and intracellularly; in contrast to its Drosophila homologue, hTAFII28 also interacts directly with TBP. Deletion analysis indicates that TBP and hTAFII18 bind to distinct domains of hTAFII28. hTAFII18 also interacts with TBP, but it interacts more strongly with hTAFII28 and hTAFII30. The binding of hTAFII28 and hTAFII30 requires distinct domains of hTAFII18. As observed with the homologous Drosophila proteins, hTAFII20 interacts directly with TBP; however, additional interactions between hTAFII20 and hTAFII28 or hTAFII30 were detected.

The yeast TATA-binding protein (TBP) core domain assembles with human TBP-associated factors into a functional TFIID complex,7799963,10.1128/mcb.15.1.534,"In mammalian and Drosophila cells, the central RNA polymerase II general transcription factor TFIID is a multisubunit complex containing the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and TBP-associated factors (TAFs) bound to the conserved TBP carboxy-terminal core domain. TBP also associates with alternative TAFs in these cells to form general transcription factors required for initiation by RNA polymerases I and III. Although extracts of human HeLa cells contain little TBP that is not associated with TAFs, free TBP is readily isolated from yeast cell extracts. However, recent studies indicate that yeast TBP can also interact with other yeast polypeptides to form multiprotein complexes. We established stable human HeLa cell lines expressing yeast TBP and several yeast-human TBP hybrids to study TBP-TAF interactions. We found that the yeast TBP core domain assembles with a complete set of human TAFs into a stable TFIID complex that can support activated transcription in vitro. The fact that the yeast TBP core, which differs from human TBP core in approximately 20% of its amino acid residues, has the structural features required to form a stable complex with human TAFs implies that Saccharomyces cerevisiae probably contains TAFs that are structurally and functionally analogous to human TAFs.

In situ hybridization reveals transient laminin B-chain expression by individual glial and muscle cells in embryonic leech central nervous system,7643070,10.1002/neu.480270102,"Laminin, which strongly stimulates axon outgrowth in vitro, appears transiently within the central nervous system (CNS) in embryos. After CNS injury, laminin reportedly reappears along axonal pathways only in animal species in which central axon regeneration is successful, including the leech Hirudo medicinalis. Although glia have been suspected of making CNS laminin, in adult leeches glia are not required for laminin synthesis and evidently microglia, not present in the early embryo, produce laminin. To determine which embryonic cells make laminin, a 1.2 kb DNA fragment of leech laminin B1 chain, with homology to Drosophila, human, and mouse B1 laminins and rat S laminin, was isolated using reverse-transcription and degenerate polymerase chain reaction (PCR) cloning. In situ hybridization revealed that laminin expression began before embryonic day 8, and by days 8 and 9 it was seen in paired CNS muscle cells. By late day 9, the two neuropil glial cells began to express laminin. Lucifer Yellow dye was injected intracellularly and muscle cells stimulated to contract, confirming the identities of muscle and glial cells. Packet glial cells began to express B1 laminin by embryonic day 12. By day 15, the cells of the perineurial sheath expressed B1 laminin, whereas it was no longer detectable in CNS muscle and glia. The results agree with published immunohistochemistry showing laminin within the CNS among growing axons by day 8, and only later in the perineurial sheath, by which time laminin disappears from within the CNS.

To study the cellular expression of DPKQDFMRFamide, we have generated antisera to DPKQD, the N-terminal sequence of the peptide, to avoid crossreactivity with other -FMRFamide-containing peptides. The antisera were purified and the specificity characterized. DPKQDFMRFamide immunoreactive material is first observed in the embryonic central nervous system (CNS) in one cell of the subesophageal ganglion and one cell in each of the three thoracic ganglia. This pattern of expression is observed in larval, pupal, and adult neural tissue, albeit with increased signal intensity. In larva, pupa, and adult, additional cells in the superior protocerebrum, a thoracic ganglion, and an abdominal ganglion express DPKQDFMRFamide immunoreactive material. Immunoreactivity is observed in a cell in the lateral protocerebrum of pupa and adult and cells in the optic lobe of adult. No immunoreactive material was observed in gut tissue. DPKQDFMRFamide antisera stain a subset of cells previously identified by in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry to express the FMRFamide transcript and polypeptide precursor.

The role of yan in mediating the choice between cell division and differentiation,8575295,,An allele of the yan locus was isolated as an enhancer of the Ellipse mutation of the Drosophila epidermal growth factor receptor (Egfr) gene.

DNA sequencing revealed that the gene consisted of eight exons ranging between 55 and 740 bp in size, and seven introns. All exon-intron junctions conformed to the GT/AG rule established for eukaryotic genes. The length of the introns was determined by PCR and was found to vary between 1.0 and 3.7 kb, indicating that the gene spans over 20 kb of the mouse genome. Primer extension allowed the mapping of the major transcription initiation site to an adenine located at the appropriate position downstream of a bona fide TATA box, in a region corresponding well to the eukaryotic consensus sequence. Over 800 bp of CRISP-3 promoter region were determined and two regions almost exactly matching the androgen-responsive element consensus RGWACANNNTGTWCY detected.

fs (1) Yb is required for ovary follicle cell differentiation in Drosophila melanogaster and has genetic interactions with the Notch group of neurogenic genes,7635286,,"Phenotypic and genetic analyses demonstrate that fs (1) Yb activity is required in the soma for the development of a subset of ovarian follicle cells and to support later stages of egg maturation. Mutations in fs (1) Yb cause a range of ovarian phenotypes, from the improper segregation of egg chambers to abnormal dorsal appendage formation. The mutant phenotypes associated with fs (1) Yb are very similar to the ovarian aberrations produced by temperature-sensitive alleles of Notch and Delta. Possible functional or regulatory interactions between fs (1) Yb and Notch are suggested by genetic studies. A duplication of the Notch locus partially suppresses the female-sterility caused by fs (1) Yb mutations, while reducing Notch dosage makes the fs (1) Yb mutant phenotype more severe. In addition, fs (1) Yb alleles also interact with genes that are known to act with or regulate Notch activity, including Delta, daughterless, and mastermind. However, differences between the mutant ovarian phenotype of fs (1) Yb and that of Notch or Delta indicate that the genes do not have completely overlapping functions in the ovary. We propose that fs (1) Yb acts as an ovary-specific factor that determines follicle cell fate.",1995,"E Johnson, S Wayne, R Nagoshi"
Association of SARFH (sarcoma-associated RNA-binding fly homolog) with regions of chromatin transcribed by RNA polymerase II,7623847,10.1128/mcb.15.8.4562,"Many oncogenes associated with human sarcomas are composed of a fusion between transcription factors and the N-terminal portions of two similar RNA-binding proteins, TLS and EWS. Though the oncogenic fusion proteins lack the RNA-binding domain and do not bind RNA, the contribution from the N-terminal portion of the RNA-binding protein is essential for their transforming activity. TLS and EWS associate in vivo with RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcripts. To learn more about the target gene specificity of this interaction, the localization of a Drosophila melanogaster protein that has extensive sequence identity to the C-terminal RNA-binding portions of TLS and EWS was studied in preparations of Drosophila polytene nuclei. cDNA clones encoding the full-length Drosophila TLS-EWS homolog, SARFH (stands for sarcoma-associated RNA-binding fly homolog), were isolated. Functional similarity to TLS and EWS was revealed by the association of SARFH with Pol II transcripts in mammalian cells and by the ability of SARFH to elicit homologous down-regulation of the levels of the mammalian proteins. The SARFH gene is expressed in the developing Drosophila embryo from the earliest stages of cellularization and is subsequently found in many cell types. In preparations of polytene chromosomes from salivary gland nuclei, SARFH antibodies recognize their target associated with the majority of active transcription units, revealed by colocalization with the phosphorylated form of RNA Pol II. We conclude that SARFH and, by homology, EWS and TLS participate in a function common to the expression of most genes transcribed by RNA Pol II.",1995,"D Immanuel, H Zinszner, D Ron"
Evolutionary conservation of a cell fate specification gene: the Hydra achaete-scute homolog has proneural activity in Drosophila,8575303,,"Members of the Achaete-scute family of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors are involved in cell fate specification in vertebrates and invertebrates. We have isolated and characterized a cnidarian achaete-scute homolog, CnASH, from Hydra vulgaris, a representative of an evolutionarily ancient branch of metazoans. There is a single achaete-scute gene in Hydra, and the bHLH domain of the predicted gene product shares a high degree of amino acid sequence similarity with those of vertebrate and Drosophila Achaete-scute proteins. In Hydra, CnASH is expressed in a subset of the interstitial cells as well as differentiation intermediates of the nematocyte pathways. In vitro translated CnASH protein can form heterodimers with the Drosophila bHLH protein Daughterless, and these dimers bind to consensus Achaete-scute DNA binding sites in a sequence-specific manner. Ectopic expression of CnASH in wild-type late third instar Drosophila larvae and early pupae leads to the formation of ectopic sensory organs, mimicking the effect of ectopic expression of the endogenous achaete-scute genes. Expression of CnASH in flies that are achaete and scute double mutants gives partial rescue of the mutant phenotype, comparable to the degree of rescue obtained by ectopic expression of the Drosophila genes. These results indicate that the achaete-scute type of bHLH genes for cell fate specification, as well as their mode of action, arose early and have been conserved during metazoan evolution.",1995,"J L Marsh, E Mason, H R Bode, A Grens"
[Features of the structure of the 7K-copy of Drosophila MDG4 (gypsy) retrotransposon provides evidence that the 7K-subfamily of MDG4 is potentially capable of transposition],7635314,,"The complete nucleotide sequence of the 7K variant of the gypsy retrotransposon of Drosophila melanogaster was determined. This variant belongs to the 7K subfamily of gypsy, which was previously considered inactive. All differences found in the sequenced 7K copy compared to the transpositionally active 6K variants were point mutations. These nucleotide substitutions account for about 1% of the total base pair number of gypsy. Long terminal repeats (LTR) have the highest rate of nucleotide substitutions However, changes in nontranslated regions did not involve the promoter region and other supposed cis-acting elements. Sixteen amino acid substitutions were found in the coding region of gypsy. These substitutions were mainly located on the boarders of potential functional domains and within the third open reading frame (ORF3). Comparative analysis of structures of these two variants of gypsy suggests the potential ability of 7K copies to transpose.",1995,"Iu V Il'in, S N Avedisov"
Dissection of the Torso signal transduction pathway in Drosophila,8607984,10.1002/mrd.1080420421,"Cell fate choice at the anterior and posterior embryonic termini of the Drosophila embryo requires the activation of a signal transduction pathway regulated by the receptor tyrosine kinase Torso. When Torso, which is uniformly distributed in the egg cell membrane, becomes activated locally at the termini, it triggers a phosphorylation cascade that culminates with localized expression of the transcription factors, tailless and huckebein. Expression of tailless and huckebein in turn determines terminal cell fates. Several genes have been characterized which encode proteins that are involved in Torso signaling: the adaptor protein Drk, the GTP-binding protein Ras1, the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Son of sevenless, and the kinases D-Raf and D-Mek. Genetic and molecular evidence supports a model in which these proteins lie in the same biochemical pathway. When activated by its ligand the membrane-bound receptor tyrosine kinase Torso initiates a signal transduction pathway mediated by Drk, Sos, and Ras1, which in turn activates a phosphorylation cascade mediated by the kinases D-Raf and D-Mek, which ultimately control the localized expression of the transcription factors tailless and huckebein. Recently, we found that D-Raf can be partially activated by Torso in the absence of Ras1, a finding supported by the phenotype of embryos lacking either Drk or Sos activity, as well as by the phenotype of a D-raf mutation that abolishes binding of Ras1 to D-Raf. These findings indicate that full D-Raf activation requires input not only from Ras1 but also from an as yet uncharacterized Ras1-independent pathway. In addition to these molecules we have characterized the putative protein tyrosine phosphatase Corkscrew as a positive transducer downstream of Torso.",1995,"X Lu, L A Perkins, M B Melnick, N Perrimon, T B Chou, J C Hsu, X S Hou"
Biochemical characterization of related microtubule proteins in Drosophila melanogaster and adult rat brain,8925297,10.1016/0006-8993(95)00952-8,"We describe the biochemical characteristics of three proteins isolated from Drosophila embryos and the rat brain. We refer to these proteins as DMAPs (Drosophila microtubule-associated proteins) since they were identified by monoclonal antibodies generated against microtubule protein (MTP) purified from Drosophila melanogaster embryos. DMAP-45 is a 45 kDa protein that binds microtubules in an ATP dependent manner. Preliminary biochemical evidence suggests that DMAP-45 may be an actin-related protein. DMAP-55 is a 55 kDa protein and based on its molecular weight and isoelectric point, may be a novel isoform of tubulin. DMAP-66 is a 66 kDa protein that binds strongly to microtubules in vitro and has multiple isoforms. Analyses of proteins in rat brain tissue extracts and purified rat brain MTP identified proteins of similar molecular weight and isoelectric points and are designated DMAP-45R, -55R and -66R.

"Expression, purification, ATPase properties, and microtubule-binding properties of the ncd motor domain",7548090,10.1021/bi00040a042,"ncd is a kinesin-related motor protein from Drosophila that moves in the opposite direction along microtubules to kinesin. To learn more about the ncd mechanism, ncd motor domain (R335-K700) was expressed in Escherichia coli and its enzymatic characteristics were studied. The ncd motor domain was purified from the cell lysate by S-Sepharose chromatography, and trace amounts of contaminants were removed by passing through a MonoQ column. The yield was 20 mg from a 500 mL culture of E. coli. The purified ncd motor domain exhibited an unusual UV spectrum with a broad peak around 272-275 nm, which was at least partly due to the bound nucleotide. Upon incubation with radioactive ATP, 3H at adenine but not 32P at gamma-phosphate was retained by the protein on gel filtration, indicating it bound ADP but not ATP. Thus, like kinesin, nucleotide binding to the ncd motor domain is tight, although there is an equilibrium between the protein and free nucleotide. We also used a fluorescent ATP analogue, mantATP, for the kinetic study of ncd motor domain. MantATP was turned over by ncd motor domain slowly in the absence of microtubules, but microtubules activated the turnover to a similar extent to that of ATP. Upon incubation with ncd motor domain, the fluorescent intensity of mantATP increased at 0.005 s-1, which is likely to reflect the release of endogenous ADP and incorporation of mantATP into the protein. The fluorescence intensity of the ncd motor domain having bound mantADP, likewise, decreased upon mixing with ATP, representing the mantADP release.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1995,"E Sablin, R D Vale, E Pechatnikova, E W Taylor, T Shimizu, R Fletterick"
Chromosomal variability and interracial hybridization in Drosophila bipectinata,8565620,,"Three paracentric inversions, In(D)2L, In(C)2R and In(H)3L, often persist in laboratory stocks of Drosophila bipectinata initiated from flies collected from natural populations. In order to test the effect of interracial hybridization on the degree of chromosomal variability, four stocks of D. bipectinata originating from different geographical localities and which were polymorphic due to the presence of three inversions, were crossed with each other. Hybrid lines as well as parental lines which served as controls were maintained in food bottles for ten generations. After ten generations, chromosomal analysis of hybrid lines as well as parental lines was undertaken. The results revealed that: all hybrid and parental lines remained polymorphic; there was a decline in the frequency of heterozygous inversions in certain hybrid populations of mixed geographical origin; and there was variation with respect to the degree of chromosomal variability in different crosses involving different inversions. These results are discussed in the light of findings reported in other Drosophila species.",1995,"B N Singh, R Banerjee"
Fasciclin II controls proneural gene expression in Drosophila,7479828,10.1073/pnas.92.23.10501,"Fasciclin II (Fas II), an NCAM-like cell adhesion molecule in Drosophila, is expressed on a subset of embryonic axons and controls selective axon fasiculation. Fas II is also expressed in imaginal discs. Here we use genetic analysis to show that Fas II is required for the control of proneural gene expression. Clusters of cells in the eye-antennal imaginal disc express the achaete proneural gene and give rise to mechanosensory neurons; other clusters of cells express the atonal gene and give rise to ocellar photoreceptor neurons. In fasII loss-of-function mutants, the expression of both proneural genes is absent in certain locations, and, as a result, the corresponding sensory precursors fail to develop. In fasII gain-of-function conditions, extra sensory structures arise from this same region of the imaginal disc. Mutations in the Abelson tyrosine kinase gene show dominant interactions with fasII mutations, suggesting that Abl and Fas II function in a signaling pathway that controls proneural gene expression.",1995,"M F VanBerkum, L García-Alonso, C S Goodman, G Grenningloh, C Schuster"
Anterior axis duplication in Xenopus induced by the over-expression of the cadherin-binding protein plakoglobin,7753837,10.1073/pnas.92.10.4522,"Plakoglobin interacts with both classical and desmosomal cadherins. It is closely related to Drosophila aramadillo (arm) gene product; arm acts in the wingless (wg)-signaling pathway to establish segment polarity. In Xenopus, homologs of wg--i.e., wnts, can produce anterior axis duplications by inducing dorsal mesoderm. Studies in Drosophila suggest that wnt acts by increasing the level of cytoplasmic armadillo protein (arm). To test whether simply increasing the level of plakoglobin mimics the effects of exogenous wnts in Xenopus, we injected fertilized eggs with RNA encoding an epitope-tagged form of plakoglobin; this induced both early radial gastrulation and anterior axis duplication. Exogenous plakoglobin accumulates in the nuclei of embryonic cells. Plakoglobin binds to the tail domain of the desmosomal cadherin desmoglein 1. When RNA encoding the tail domain of desmoglein was coinjected with plakoglobin RNA, both the dorsalizing effect and nuclear accumulation of plakoglobin were suppressed. Mutational analysis indicates that the central arm repeat region of plakoglobin is sufficient to induce axis duplication and that this polypeptide accumulates in the nuclei of embryonic cells. These data show that increased plakoglobin levels can, by themselves, generate the intracellular signals involved in the specification of dorsal mesoderm.",1995,"M W Klymkowsky, A Karnovsky"
Mitochondrial single-stranded DNA-binding protein from Drosophila embryos. Physical and biochemical characterization,7673145,10.1074/jbc.270.36.21137,"Using a stringent purification procedure on single-stranded DNA cellulose, we have isolated the mitochondrial single-stranded DNA-binding protein from Drosophila melanogaster embryos. Its identity is demonstrated by amino-terminal sequencing of the homogeneous protein and by its localization to a mitochondrial protein fraction. The mitochondrial protein is immunologically and biochemically distinct from the previously characterized nuclear replication protein A from Drosophila (Mitsis, P. G., Kowalczykowski, S. C., and Lehman, I. R. (1993) Biochemistry 32, 5257-5266; Marton, R. F., Thömmes, P., and Cotterill, S. (1994) FEBS Lett. 342, 139-144). It consists of a single polypeptide of 18 kDa, which is responsible for the DNA binding activity. Sedimentation analysis suggests that D. melanogaster mitochondrial single-stranded DNA-binding protein exists as a homo-oligomer, possibly a tetramer, in solution. The protein binds to DNA in its single-stranded form with a strong preference over double-stranded DNA or RNA, and binds to polypyrimidines preferentially over polypurines. Drosophila mitochondrial single-stranded DNA-binding protein exhibits a greater affinity for long oligonucleotides as compared to short ones, yet does not show high cooperativity. Its binding site size, determined by competition studies and by fluorescence quenching, is approximately 17 nucleotides under low salt conditions, and increases in the presence of greater than 150 mM NaCl. The homogeneous protein stimulates the activity of mitochondrial DNA polymerase from D. melanogaster embryos, increasing dramatically the rate of initiation of DNA synthesis on a singly primed DNA template.",1995,"P Thömmes, R F Marton, L S Kaguni, C L Farr, S Cotterill"
Beyond ROS clearance: Peroxiredoxins in stress signaling and aging,29580920,10.1016/j.arr.2018.03.005,"Antioxidants were long predicted to have lifespan-promoting effects, but in general this prediction has not been well supported. While some antioxidants do seem to have a clear effect on longevity, this may not be primarily as a result of their role in the removal of reactive oxygen species, but rather mediated by other mechanisms such as the modulation of intracellular signaling. In this review we discuss peroxiredoxins, a class of proteinaceous antioxidants with redox signaling and chaperone functions, and their involvement in regulating longevity and stress resistance. Peroxiredoxins have a clear role in the regulation of lifespan and survival of many model organisms, including the mouse, Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster. Recent research on peroxiredoxins - in these models and beyond - has revealed surprising new insights regarding the interplay between peroxiredoxins and longevity signaling, which will be discussed here in detail.

Ankyrin repeat and single KH domain 1 (ANKHD1) drives renal cancer cell proliferation via binding to and altering a subset of miRNAs,29695508,10.1074/jbc.RA117.000975,"Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) represents the most common kidney cancer worldwide. Increased cell proliferation associated with abnormal microRNA (miRNA) regulation are hallmarks of carcinogenesis. Ankyrin repeat and single KH domain 1 (ANKHD1) is a highly conserved protein found to interact with core cancer pathways in Drosophila; however, its involvement in RCC is completely unexplored. Quantitative PCR studies coupled with large-scale genomics data sets demonstrated that ANKHD1 is significantly up-regulated in kidneys of RCC patients when compared with healthy controls. Cell cycle analysis revealed that ANKHD1 is an essential factor for RCC cell division. To understand the molecular mechanism(s) utilized by ANKHD1 to drive proliferation, we performed bioinformatics analyses that revealed that ANKHD1 contains a putative miRNA-binding motif. We screened 48 miRNAs with tumor-enhancing or -suppressing activities and found that ANKHD1 binds to and regulates three tumor-suppressing miRNAs (i.e. miR-29a, miR-205, and miR-196a). RNA-immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that ANKHD1 physically interacts with its target miRNAs via a single K-homology domain, located in the C terminus of the protein. Functionally, we discovered that ANKHD1 positively drives ccRCC cell mitosis via binding to and suppressing mainly miR-29a and to a lesser degree via miR-196a/205, leading to up-regulation in proliferative genes such as CCDN1. Collectively, these data identify ANKHD1 as a new regulator of ccRCC proliferation via specific miRNA interactions.",2018,"Maria Fragiadaki, Martin P Zeidler"
Photochemical Treatment of Drosophila APCs Can Eliminate Associated Viruses and Maintain the APC Function for Generating Antigen-Specific CTLs Ex Vivo,30327581,10.1155/2018/4167652,"Drosophila cells transfected with MHC class I and a number of costimulation molecules including B7.1, ICAM, LFA-3, and CD70 are potent antigen-presenting cells (APCs) for the generation of antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) in vitro. Using Drosophila APCs, CTLs specific for melanoma antigens have been generated in vitro and adoptively transferred to melanoma patients. However, the recent discovery that Drosophila cells can carry insect viruses raises the potential risk of Drosophila APCs transmitting xenogenic viruses to patient CTLs. In this study, we have investigated photoreactive methods to inactivate insect viruses in APC. A clinical grade psoralen compound, 8-MOP (UVADEX) in combination with UVA treatment (5 joules/cm2) can be used to inactivate Drosophila cell viruses. UVADEX treatment is sufficient to inactivate insect viruses but does not affect the expression of MHC class I molecules and costimulation molecules on Drosophila APCs. In fact, UVADEX treatment prevents Drosophila APC growth while maintaining APC function. Furthermore, UVADEX-treated Drosophila APCs maintain or have enhanced APC function as determined by enhanced T cell activation, proliferation, and CTL generation. Thus, the use of UVADEX-treated Drosophila APCs may provide a valuable tool for immunotherapy to generate tumor antigen-specific CTLs.",2018,"Jun Ye, Chunxia Yang, Weixing Shi, Zeling Cai, Hong Yu"
"The ""unguarded-X"" and the genetic architecture of lifespan: Inbreeding results in a potentially maladaptive sex-specific reduction of female lifespan in Drosophila melanogaster",29336481,10.1111/evo.13426,"Sex differences in ageing and lifespan are ubiquitous in nature. The ""unguarded-X"" hypothesis (UXh) suggests they may be partly due to the expression of recessive mutations in the hemizygous sex chromosomes of the heterogametic sex, which could help explain sex-specific ageing in a broad array of taxa. A prediction central to the UX hypothesis is that inbreeding will decrease the lifespan of the homogametic sex more than the heterogametic sex, because only in the former does inbreeding increase the expression of recessive deleterious mutations. In this study, we test this prediction by examining the effects of inbreeding on the lifespan and fitness of male and female Drosophila melanogaster across different social environments. We found that, across social environments, inbreeding resulted in a greater reduction of female than male lifespan, and that inbreeding effects on fitness did not seem to counterbalance sex-specific effects on lifespan, suggesting the former are maladaptative. Inter- and intra-sexual correlation analyses also allowed us to identify evidence of an underlying joint genetic architecture for inbreeding effects on lifespan. We discuss these results in light of the UXh and other alternative explanations, and suggest that more attention should be paid to the possibility that the ""unguarded-X"" may play an important role in the evolution of sex-specific lifespan.",2018,"Muhammed Andic, Pau Carazo, Zahida Sultanova"
Yeast quality in juvenile diet affects Drosophila melanogaster adult life traits,30166573,10.1038/s41598-018-31561-9,"Diet quality is critical for animal development and survival.

Drosophila studies examining the influence of yeast quality in the diet have generally either provided the diet over the whole life span (larva to adult) or during the adult stage and have rarely focussed on the juvenile diet. Here, we tested the effect of yeast quality in the larval diet on pre-adult development and adult weight, survival, reproduction and food preference. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was added in three forms in three treatments-live, heated or dried-to food used as the juvenile diet or was not added (empty treatment). Adults resulting from the larvae raised on these four juvenile diets were all maintained on a similar standard laboratory food diet. Our data indicate that yeast quality in the juvenile diet affects larva-to-pupa-but not pupa-to-adult-development.

Fruit Flies Provide New Insights in Low-Radiation Background Biology at the INFN Underground Gran Sasso National Laboratory (LNGS),29863430,10.1667/RR15083.1,"Deep underground laboratories (DULs) were originally created to host particle, astroparticle or nuclear physics experiments requiring a low-background environment with vastly reduced levels of cosmic-ray particle interference.

So far, underground biology experiments are ongoing or planned in a few of the currently operating DULs. Among these DULs is the Gran Sasso National Laboratory (LNGS), where the majority of radiobiological data have been collected. Here we provide a summary of the current scenario of DULs around the world, as well as the specific features of the LNGS and a summary of the results we obtained so far, together with other findings collected in different underground laboratories. In particular, we focus on the recent results from our studies of Drosophila melanogaster, which provide the first evidence of the influence of the radiation environment on life span, fertility and response to genotoxic stress at the organism level. Given the increasing interest in this field and the establishment of new projects, it is possible that in the near future more DULs will serve as sites of radiobiology experiments, thus providing further relevant biological information at extremely low-dose-rate radiation. Underground experiments can be nicely complemented with above-ground studies at increasing dose rate. A systematic study performed in different exposure scenarios provides a potential opportunity to address important radiation protection questions, such as the dose/dose-rate relationship for cancer and non-cancer risk, the possible existence of dose/dose-rate threshold(s) for different biological systems and/or end points and the possible role of radiation quality in triggering the biological response.",2018,"Maria Antonella Tabocchini, Giuseppe Esposito, Patrizia Morciano, Antonella Porrazzo, Giovanni Cenci, Francesca Cipressa"

Helena and BS: Two Travellers between the Genera Drosophila and Zaprionus,30165545,10.1093/gbe/evy184,"The frequency of horizontal transfers of transposable elements (HTTs) varies among the types of elements according to the transposition mode and the geographical and temporal overlap of the species involved in the transfer.

This is particularly true of the subgenus Zaprionus and the melanogaster subgroup, which overlapped both geographically and temporally in Tropical Africa during their period of origin and diversification. Here, we tested the hypothesis that this overlap may have facilitated the transfer of retrotransposons without long terminal repeats (non-LTRs) between these species. We estimated the HTT frequency of the non-LTRs BS and Helena at the genome-wide scale by using a phylogenetic framework and a vertical and horizontal inheritance consistence analysis (VHICA). An excessively low synonymous divergence among distantly related species and incongruities between the transposable element and species phylogenies allowed us to propose at least four relatively recent HTT events of Helena and BS involving ancestors of the subgroup melanogaster and ancestors of the subgenus Zaprionus during their concomitant diversification in Tropical Africa, along with older possible events between species of the subgenera Drosophila and Sophophora.

NADPH oxidase-generated reactive oxygen species in mature follicles are essential for Drosophila ovulation,29987037,10.1073/pnas.1800115115,"Ovarian reactive oxygen species (ROS) are believed to regulate ovulation in mammals, but the details of ROS production in follicles and the role of ROS in ovulation in other species remain underexplored. In Drosophila ovulation, matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) is required for follicle rupture by degradation of posterior follicle cells surrounding a mature oocyte. We recently demonstrated that MMP2 activation and follicle rupture are regulated by the neuronal hormone octopamine (OA) and the octopamine receptor in mushroom body (OAMB). In the current study, we investigated the role of the superoxide-generating enzyme NADPH oxidase (NOX) in Drosophila ovulation. We report that Nox is highly enriched in mature follicle cells and that Nox knockdown in these cells leads to a reduction in superoxide and to defective ovulation. Similar to MMP2 activation, NOX enzymatic activity is also controlled by the OA/OAMB-Ca2+ signaling pathway. In addition, we report that extracellular superoxide dismutase 3 (SOD3) is required to convert superoxide to hydrogen peroxide, which acts as the key signaling molecule for follicle rupture, independent of MMP2 activation. Given that Nox homologs are expressed in mammalian follicles, the NOX-dependent hydrogen peroxide signaling pathway that we describe could play a conserved role in regulating ovulation in other species.",2018,"Wei Li, Jianjun Sun, Jessica F Young"
"Omega-3 Monoacylglyceride Effects on Longevity, Mitochondrial Metabolism and Oxidative Stress: Insights from Drosophila melanogaster",30453574,10.3390/md16110453,"During the last decade, essential polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) such as eicosatetraenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) derived from marine sources have been investigated as nonpharmacological dietary supplements to improve different pathological conditions, as well as aging. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of dietary n-3 PUFA monoacylglycerides (MAG, both EPA and DHA) on the mitochondrial metabolism and oxidative stress of a short-lifespan model, Drosophila melanogaster, sampled at five different ages. Our results showed that diets supplemented with MAG-EPA and MAG-DHA increased median lifespan by 14.6% and decreased mitochondrial proton leak resulting in an increase of mitochondrial coupling. The flies fed on MAG-EPA also had higher electron transport system capacity and mitochondrial oxidative capacities. Moreover, both n-3 PUFAs delayed the occurrence of lipid peroxidation but only flies fed the MAG-EPA diet showed maintenance of superoxide dismutase activity during aging. Our study therefore highlights the potential of n-3 PUFA monoacylglycerides as nutraceutical compounds to delay the onset of senescence by acting directly or indirectly on the mitochondrial metabolism and suggests that Drosophila could be a relevant model for the study of the fundamental mechanisms linking the effects of n-3 PUFAs to aging.",2018,"Robert P J Cormier, Nicolas Pichaud, Patrick-Denis St-Coeur, Chloé J Simard, Camille M Champigny, Samuel Fortin"
The lysosomal membrane protein LAMP2A promotes autophagic flux and prevents SNCA-induced Parkinson disease-like symptoms in the Drosophila brain,29989488,10.1080/15548627.2018.1491489,"The autophagy-lysosome pathway plays a fundamental role in the clearance of aggregated proteins and protection against cellular stress and neurodegenerative conditions. Alterations in autophagy processes, including macroautophagy and chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), have been described in Parkinson disease (PD). CMA is a selective autophagic process that depends on LAMP2A (lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2A), a mammal and bird-specific membrane glycoprotein that translocates cytosolic proteins containing a KFERQ-like peptide motif across the lysosomal membrane. Drosophila reportedly lack CMA and use endosomal microautophagy (eMI) as an alternative selective autophagic process. Here we report that neuronal expression of human LAMP2A protected Drosophila against starvation and oxidative stress, and delayed locomotor decline in aging flies without extending their lifespan. LAMP2A also prevented the progressive locomotor and oxidative defects induced by neuronal expression of PD-associated human SNCA (synuclein alpha) with alanine-to-proline mutation at position 30 (SNCAA30P). Using KFERQ-tagged fluorescent biosensors, we observed that LAMP2A expression stimulated selective autophagy in the adult brain and not in the larval fat body, but did not increase this process under starvation conditions. Noteworthy, we found that neurally expressed LAMP2A markedly upregulated levels of Drosophila Atg5, a key macroautophagy initiation protein, and that it increased the density of Atg8a/LC3-positive puncta, which reflects the formation of autophagosomes.

Kinesin-2 and IFT-A act as a complex promoting nuclear localization of β-catenin during Wnt signalling,30546012,10.1038/s41467-018-07605-z,"Wnt/Wg-signalling is critical signalling in all metazoans. Recent studies suggest that IFT-A proteins and Kinesin-2 modulate canonical Wnt/Wg-signalling independently of their ciliary role. Whether they function together in Wnt-signalling and their mechanistic role in the pathway remained unresolved. Here we demonstrate that Kinesin-2 and IFT-A proteins act as a complex during Drosophila Wg-signalling, affecting pathway activity in the same manner, interacting genetically and physically, and co-localizing with β-catenin, the mediator of Wnt/Wg-signalling on microtubules. Following pathway activation, Kinesin-2/IFT-A mutant cells exhibit high cytoplasmic β-catenin levels, yet fail to activate Wg-targets. In mutant tissues in both, Drosophila and mouse/MEFs, nuclear localization of β-catenin is markedly reduced. We demonstrate a conserved, motor-domain dependent function of the Kinesin-2/IFT-A complex in promoting nuclear translocation of β-catenin. We show that this is mediated by protecting β-catenin from a conserved cytoplasmic retention process, thus identifying a mechanism for Kinesin-2/IFT-A in Wnt-signalling that is independent of their ciliary role.",2018,"Linh T Vuong, Marek Mlodzik, Stuart A Aaronson, Sophie Balmer, Davide Esposito, Carlo Iomini"
"Non-coding RNA Expression, Function, and Variation during Drosophila Embryogenesis",30393032,10.1016/j.cub.2018.09.026,"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) can often function in the regulation of gene expression during development; however, their generality as essential regulators in developmental processes and organismal phenotypes remains unclear. Here, we performed a tailored investigation of lncRNA expression and function during Drosophila embryogenesis, interrogating multiple stages, tissue specificity, nuclear localization, and genetic backgrounds. Our results almost double the number of annotated lncRNAs expressed at these embryonic stages. lncRNA levels are generally positively correlated with those of their neighboring genes, with little evidence of transcriptional interference. Using fluorescent in situ hybridization, we report the spatiotemporal expression of 15 new lncRNAs, revealing very dynamic tissue-specific patterns. Despite this, deletion of selected lncRNA genes had no obvious developmental defects or effects on viability under standard and stressed conditions. However, two lncRNA deletions resulted in modest expression changes of a small number of genes, suggesting that they fine-tune expression of non-essential genes. Several lncRNAs have strain-specific expression, indicating that they are not fixed within the population. This intra-species variation across genetic backgrounds may thereby be a useful tool to distinguish rapidly evolving lncRNAs with as yet non-essential roles.",2018,"Giovanni Bussotti, Ignacio E Schor, Mattia Forneris, Eileen E M Furlong, Anton J Enright, Matilda Maleš, Rebecca R Viales"
The early life of a fly glial cell,26224590,10.1002/wdev.200,"Throughout evolution, glia have key regulatory roles in neural development and function.

Further Screening of Entomopathogenic Fungi and Nematodes as Control Agents for Drosophila suzukii,27294962,10.3390/insects7020024,"Drosophila suzukii populations remain low in the UK. To date, there have been no reports of widespread damage. Previous research demonstrated that various species of entomopathogenic fungi and nematodes could potentially suppress D. suzukii population development under laboratory trials. However, none of the given species was concluded to be specifically efficient in suppressing D. suzukii. Therefore, there is a need to screen further species to determine their efficacy. The following entomopathogenic agents were evaluated for their potential to act as control agents for D. suzukii: Metarhizium anisopliae; Isaria fumosorosea; a non-commercial coded fungal product (Coded B); Steinernema feltiae, S. carpocapsae, S. kraussei and Heterorhabditis bacteriophora. The fungi were screened for efficacy against the fly on fruit while the nematodes were evaluated for the potential to be applied as soil drenches targeting larvae and pupal life-stages. All three fungi species screened reduced D. suzukii populations developing from infested berries. Isaria fumosorosea significantly (p < 0.001) reduced population development of D. suzukii from infested berries. All nematodes significantly reduced adult emergence from pupal cases compared to the water control. Larvae proved more susceptible to nematode infection. Heterorhabditis bacteriophora proved the best from the four nematodes investigated; readily emerging from punctured larvae and causing 95% mortality. The potential of the entomopathogens to suppress D. suzukii populations is discussed.",2016,"Neil Audsley, Andrew G S Cuthbertson"
Ferritin Assembly in Enterocytes of Drosophila melanogaster,26861293,10.3390/ijms17020027,"Ferritins are protein nanocages that accumulate inside their cavity thousands of oxidized iron atoms bound to oxygen and phosphates. Both characteristic types of eukaryotic ferritin subunits are present in secreted ferritins from insects, but here dimers between Ferritin 1 Heavy Chain Homolog (Fer1HCH) and Ferritin 2 Light Chain Homolog (Fer2LCH) are further stabilized by disulfide-bridge in the 24-subunit complex. We addressed ferritin assembly and iron loading in vivo using novel transgenic strains of Drosophila melanogaster. We concentrated on the intestine, where the ferritin induction process can be controlled experimentally by dietary iron manipulation. We showed that the expression pattern of Fer2LCH-Gal4 lines recapitulated iron-dependent endogenous expression of the ferritin subunits and used these lines to drive expression from UAS-mCherry-Fer2LCH transgenes. We found that the Gal4-mediated induction of mCherry-Fer2LCH subunits was too slow to effectively introduce them into newly formed ferritin complexes. Endogenous Fer2LCH and Fer1HCH assembled and stored excess dietary iron, instead. In contrast, when flies were genetically manipulated to co-express Fer2LCH and mCherry-Fer2LCH simultaneously, both subunits were incorporated with Fer1HCH in iron-loaded ferritin complexes. Our study provides fresh evidence that, in insects, ferritin assembly and iron loading in vivo are tightly regulated.",2016,"Fanis Missirlis, Bertrand Mollereau, Abraham Rosas-Arellano, Liisa M Blowes, Johana Vásquez-Procopio, Alexis Gambis, Hermann Steller"
"Mitonuclear interactions, mtDNA-mediated thermal plasticity, and implications for the Trojan Female Technique for pest control",27443488,10.1038/srep30016,"Pest species pose major challenges to global economies, ecosystems, and health. Unfortunately, most conventional approaches to pest control remain costly, and temporary in effect. As such, a heritable variant of the Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) was proposed, based on the introduction of mitochondrial DNA mutations into pest populations, which impair male fertility but have no effects on females. Evidence for this ""Trojan Female Technique"" (TFT) was recently provided, in the form of a mutation in the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene (mt:Cyt-b) of Drosophila melanogaster which reduces male fertility across diverse nuclear backgrounds. However, recent studies have shown that the magnitude of mitochondrial genetic effects on the phenotype can vary greatly across environments, with mtDNA polymorphisms commonly entwined in genotype-by-environment (G × E) interactions. Here we test whether the male-sterilizing effects previously associated with the mt:Cyt-b mutation are consistent across three thermal and three nuclear genomic contexts. The effects of this mutation were indeed moderated by the nuclear background and thermal environment, but crucially the fertility of males carrying the mutation was invariably reduced relative to controls. This mutation thus constitutes a promising candidate for the further development of the TFT.",2016,"Jonci N Wolff, Daniel M Tompkins, Damian K Dowling, Neil J Gemmell"
Delayed glial clearance of degenerating axons in aged Drosophila is due to reduced PI3K/Draper activity,27647497,10.1038/ncomms12871,"Advanced age is the greatest risk factor for neurodegenerative disorders, but the mechanisms that render the senescent brain vulnerable to disease are unclear. Glial immune responses provide neuroprotection in a variety of contexts. Thus, we explored how glial responses to neurodegeneration are altered with age. Here we show that glia-axon phagocytic interactions change dramatically in the aged Drosophila brain. Aged glia clear degenerating axons slowly due to low phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) signalling and, subsequently, reduced expression of the conserved phagocytic receptor Draper/MEGF10. Importantly, boosting PI3K/Draper activity in aged glia significantly reverses slow phagocytic responses. Moreover, several hours post axotomy, early hallmarks of Wallerian degeneration (WD) are delayed in aged flies. We propose that slow clearance of degenerating axons is mechanistically twofold, resulting from deferred initiation of axonal WD and reduced PI3K/Draper-dependent glial phagocytic function. Interventions that boost glial engulfment activity, however, can substantially reverse delayed clearance of damaged neuronal debris.",2016,"Maria D Purice, Sean D Speese, Mary A Logan"
Methods to Examine the Lymph Gland and Hemocytes in Drosophila Larvae,27929462,10.3791/54544,"Many parallels exist between the Drosophila and mammalian hematopoietic systems, even though Drosophila lack the lymphoid lineage that characterize mammalian adaptive immunity. Drosophila and mammalian hematopoiesis occur in spatially and temporally distinct phases to produce several blood cell lineages. Both systems maintain reservoirs of blood cell progenitors with which to expand or replace mature lineages. The hematopoietic system allows Drosophila and mammals to respond to and to adapt to immune challenges. Importantly, the transcriptional regulators and signaling pathways that control the generation, maintenance, and function of the hematopoietic system are conserved from flies to mammals. These similarities allow Drosophila to be used to genetically model hematopoietic development and disease. Here we detail assays to examine the hematopoietic system of Drosophila larvae. In particular, we outline methods to measure blood cell numbers and concentration, visualize a specific mature lineage in vivo, and perform immunohistochemistry on blood cells in circulation and in the hematopoietic organ. These assays can reveal changes in gene expression and cellular processes including signaling, survival, proliferation, and differentiation and can be used to investigate a variety of questions concerning hematopoiesis. Combined with the genetic tools available in Drosophila, these assays can be used to evaluate the hematopoietic system upon defined genetic alterations. While not specifically outlined here, these assays can also be used to examine the effect of environmental alterations, such as infection or diet, on the hematopoietic system.",2016,"Cathie M Pfleger, Theresa A Reimels"

We also compared measures of variation within and differentiation between our populations to simulations based on a variety of evolutionary scenarios. Our analysis yielded no clear evidence of hard selective sweeps, whereby natural selection acts to increase the frequency of a newly-arising mutation in a population until it becomes fixed. We do find evidence for selection acting on standing genetic variation, as independent replicate populations exhibit similar population-genetic dynamics, without obvious fixation of candidate alleles under selection. A hidden-Markov model test for selection also found widespread evidence for selection. We found more genetic variation genome-wide, and less differentiation between replicate populations genome-wide, than arose in any of our simulated evolutionary scenarios.",2016,"Lee F Greer, Mark A Phillips, Anthony D Long, Michael R Rose, Zachary S Greenspan, Molly K Burke, Kennedy C Matsagas, Bryant Villeponteau, Laurence D Mueller, Cristina L Rizza"
Small Peptides as Newcomers in the Control of Drosophila Development,26969979,10.1016/bs.ctdb.2015.11.004,"Throughout the last century, studies using the fruit fly have contributed to the discovery of many key genetic elements that control animal development.

However, there is mounting evidence that both mRNA and noncoding RNAs often contain small open reading frames (sORFs/smORFs), which can be translated into peptides. While genome-wide profiling supports a pervasive translation of these noncanonical sORF/smORF/SEP peptides, their functions remain poorly understood. Here, we review recent data obtained in Drosophila demonstrating the overlooked role of smORF peptides in the control of development and adult life.

Planar cell polarity: the Dachsous/Fat system contributes differently to the embryonic and larval stages of Drosophila,26935392,10.1242/bio.017152,"The epidermal patterns of all three larval instars (L1-L3) ofDrosophilaare made by one unchanging set of cells.

In L1 all the predenticles originate at the back of the cells but, in L2 and L3, they form at the front or the back of the cell depending on the polarity of the forthcoming denticles. We find that, to polarise all rows, the Dachsous/Fat system is differentially utilised; in L1 it is active in the placement of the actin-based predenticles but is not crucial for the final orientation of the cuticular denticles, in L2 and L3 it is needed for placement and polarity. We find Four-jointed to be strongly expressed in the tendon cells and show how this might explain the orientation of all seven rows. Unexpectedly, we find that L3 that lack Dachsous differ from larvae lacking Fat and we present evidence that this is due to differently mislocalised Dachs.

Knocking down endogenous WSB1 exacerbates mutant LRRK2 neuronal toxicity in neurons and the Drosophila model, indicating a role for endogenous WSB1 in modulating LRRK2 cell toxicity. WSB1 is in Lewy bodies in human PD post-mortem tissue. These data demonstrate a role for WSB1 in mutant LRRK2 pathogenesis, and suggest involvement in Lewy body pathology in sporadic PD.

Myosin-dependent remodeling of adherens junctions protects junctions from Snail-dependent disassembly,26754645,10.1083/jcb.201508056,"Although Snail is essential for disassembly of adherens junctions during epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMTs), loss of adherens junctions in Drosophila melanogaster gastrula is delayed until mesoderm is internalized, despite the early expression of Snail in that primordium. By combining live imaging and quantitative image analysis, we track the behavior of E-cadherin-rich junction clusters, demonstrating that in the early stages of gastrulation most subapical clusters in mesoderm not only persist, but move apically and enhance in density and total intensity. All three phenomena depend on myosin II and are temporally correlated with the pulses of actomyosin accumulation that drive initial cell shape changes during gastrulation. When contractile myosin is absent, the normal Snail expression in mesoderm, or ectopic Snail expression in ectoderm, is sufficient to drive early disassembly of junctions. In both cases, junctional disassembly can be blocked by simultaneous induction of myosin contractility. Our findings provide in vivo evidence for mechanosensitivity of cell-cell junctions and imply that myosin-mediated tension can prevent Snail-driven EMT.",2016,"Eric Wieschaus, Mo Weng"
The Drosophila melanogaster homolog of UBE3A is not imprinted in neurons,27599063,10.1080/15592294.2016.1214783,"In mammals, expression of UBE3A is epigenetically regulated in neurons and expression is restricted to the maternal copy of UBE3A.

However, complex epigenetic regulatory features of the mammalian imprinting center are not present in Drosophila, and allele specific expression of Dube3a has not been documented. We used behavioral and electrophysiological analysis of the Dube3a loss-of-function allele (Dube3a15b) to investigate Dube3a imprinting in fly neurons. We found that motor impairment (climbing ability) and a newly-characterized defect in synaptic transmission are independent of parental inheritance of the Dube3a15b allele. Furthermore, expression analysis of coding single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in Dube3a did not reveal allele specific expression differences among reciprocal crosses.

Calcium Imaging of Neuronal Activity in Drosophila Can Identify Anticonvulsive Compounds,26863447,10.1371/journal.pone.0148461,"Although there are now a number of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) available, approximately one-third of epilepsy patients respond poorly to drug intervention. The reasons for this are complex, but are probably reflective of the increasing number of identified mutations that predispose individuals to this disease. Thus, there is a clear requirement for the development of novel treatments to address this unmet clinical need. The existence of gene mutations that mimic a seizure-like behaviour in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, offers the possibility to exploit the powerful genetics of this insect to identify novel cellular targets to facilitate design of more effective AEDs. In this study we use neuronal expression of GCaMP, a potent calcium reporter, to image neuronal activity using a non-invasive and rapid method. Expression in motoneurons in the isolated CNS of third instar larvae shows waves of calcium-activity that pass between segments of the ventral nerve cord. Time between calcium peaks, in the same neurons, between adjacent segments usually show a temporal separation of greater than 200 ms. Exposure to proconvulsants (picrotoxin or 4-aminopyridine) reduces separation to below 200 ms showing increased synchrony of activity across adjacent segments. Increased synchrony, characteristic of epilepsy, is similarly observed in genetic seizure mutants: bangsenseless1 (bss1) and paralyticK1270T (paraK1270T). Exposure of bss1 to clinically-used antiepileptic drugs (phenytoin or gabapentin) significantly reduces synchrony. In this study we use the measure of synchronicity to evaluate the effectiveness of known and novel anticonvulsive compounds (antipain, isethionate, etopiside rapamycin and dipyramidole) to reduce seizure-like CNS activity. We further show that such compounds also reduce the Drosophila voltage-gated persistent Na+ current (INaP) in an identified motoneuron (aCC).

Myocardial depolarization leading to cardiac muscle contraction is reflected by the amplitude and duration of the QRS complex on the electrocardiogram (ECG). Abnormal QRS amplitude or duration reflect changes in myocardial mass and conduction, and are associated with increased risk of heart failure and death. Objectives: This meta-analysis sought to gain insights into the genetic determinants of myocardial mass. Methods: We carried out a genome-wide association meta-analysis of 4 QRS traits in up to 73,518 individuals of European ancestry, followed by extensive biological and functional assessment. Results: We identified 52 genomic loci, of which 32 are novel, that are reliably associated with 1 or more QRS phenotypes at p < 1 × 10(-8). These loci are enriched in regions of open chromatin, histone modifications, and transcription factor binding, suggesting that they represent regions of the genome that are actively transcribed in the human heart. Pathway analyses provided evidence that these loci play a role in cardiac hypertrophy. We further highlighted 67 candidate genes at the identified loci that are preferentially expressed in cardiac tissue and associated with cardiac abnormalities in Drosophila melanogaster and Mus musculus.

Ectopic E2F expression induces S phase and apoptosis in Drosophila imaginal discs,8647438,10.1101/gad.10.11.1422,"Previous experiments suggest that a key event in the commitment of cultured mammalian cells to entering S phase is a rise in activity of the transcription factor E2F. In this report, we study the role of Drosophila E2F in imaginal disc cells in vivo, by examining the distribution of the endogenous protein and studying the consequences of ectopic E2F expression. First, we find that endogenous E217 falls from high to very low levels as cells initiate DNA synthesis during a developmentally regulated G1-S-transition in the eye disc. Second, we find that ectopic E2F expression drives many otherwise quiescent cells to enter S phase. Subsequently, cells throughout the discs express reaper (a regulator of apoptosis) and then die. Third, we find that ectopic E2F expression during S phase in normally cycling cells blocks their re-entry into S phase in the following cell cycle. Although we do not know the fate of these cells, we suspect that ultimately they are killed by ectopic E2F. Taken together, our results show that an elevation in the level of E2F is sufficient to induce imaginal disc cells to enter S phase. Furthermore, they suggest that the downregulation of E2F upon entry into S phase may be essential to prevent the induction of apoptosis.",1996,"M Asano, R P Wharton, J R Nevins"

In primary spermatocytes, three of these loci form large lampbrush loops containing RNA transcripts and associated proteins. The identities and functions of these Y chromosome loop-binding proteins are largely unknown. This report demonstrates that the RB97D protein, which is essential for spermatogenesis, bound to a specific lampbrush loop. RB97D contains two copies of a well-characterized RNA binding domain, the RNA recognition motif, followed by a proline-glutamine rich domain. Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence experiments showed that in the testis, RB97D was found only in primary spermatocyte nuclei and associated with the C loop from the ks-1 fertility locus in an RNAse-sensitive manner. The anti-RB97D antibodies also bound a single Y chromosome loop in D. hydei, suggesting that the protein and its loop-binding function have been evolutionarily conserved. These results demonstrate that the proteins that bind lampbrush loops can be essential for fertility. Since RB97D was present only premeiotically, its function is likely to be directly related to the metabolism of the C loop transcripts.",1996,"S R Haynes, V M Heatwole"

In flies in which HRB87F/hrp36 had been overexpressed 10- to 15-fold above normal levels, aberrant internal exon skipping was induced in at least one endogenous transcript, the dopa decarboxylase (Ddc) pre-mRNA, which previously had been shown to be similarly affected by excess HRB98DE/hrp38. In a second endogenous pre-mRNA, excess HRB87F/hrp36 had no effect on alternative 3' splice-site selection, as expected from mammalian hnRNP studies. Immunolocalization of the excess hnRNP protein showed that it localized correctly to the nucleus, specifically to sites on or near chromosomes, and that the peak of exon-skipping activity in Ddc RNA correlated with the peak of chromosomally associated hnRNP protein. The chromosomal association and level of the SR family of proteins were not significantly affected by the large increase in hnRNP proteins during this time period. Although these results are consistent with a possible role for hnRNP proteins in alternative splicing, the more interesting finding was the failure to detect significant adverse effects on flies with a greatly distorted ratio of hnRNPs to SR proteins. Electron microscopic visualization of the general population of active genes in flies overexpressing hnRNP proteins also indicated that the great majority of genes seemed normal in terms of cotranscriptional RNA processing events, although there were a few abnormalities consistent with rare exon-skipping events. Furthermore, in a Hrb87F null mutant, which is viable, the normal pattern of Ddc alternative splicing was observed, indicating that HRB87F/hrp36 is not required for Ddc splicing regulation. Thus, although splice-site selection can be affected in at least a few genes by gross overexpression of this hnRNP protein, the combined evidence suggests that if it plays a general role in alternative splicing in vivo, the role can be provided by other proteins with redundant functions, and the role is independent of its concentration relative to SR proteins.",1996,"K Zu, M L Sikes, A L Beyer, S R Haynes"
"Axonemal tubulin polyglycylation probed with two monoclonal antibodies: widespread evolutionary distribution, appearance during spermatozoan maturation and possible function in motility",8718664,,"Two monoclonal antibodies, AXO 49 and TAP 952, probed with carboxy-terminal peptides from Paramecium axonemal tubulin and with polyglycylated synthetic peptides, are found to recognize differently tubulin polyglycylation, the most recently identified posttranslational modification discovered in Paramecium axonemal tubulin. With these antibodies, we show that tubulin polyglycylation is widely distributed in organisms ranging from ciliated protozoa to mammals; it arose early in the course of evolution, but seems to be absent in primitive protozoa such as the Euglenozoa. Tubulin polyglycylation is the last posttranslational modification which takes place in the course of Drosophila spermatogenesis and its occurrence corresponds to the end of spermatozoan maturation. An involvement of polyglycylated tubulin in axoneme motility is suggested since AXO 49 and TAP 952 specifically inhibit the reactivated motility of sea urchin spermatozoa.",1996,"N Levilliers, J M Schmitter, M Quibell, M H Bré, V Redeker, J Rossler, J Darmanaden-Delorme, C Bressac, A Adoutte, J Cosson, P Huitorel, T Johnson"
Meiotic transvection in fungi,8689677,10.1016/s0092-8674(00)80081-1,"The Neurospora crassa Asm-1+ (ascospore maturation 1) gene encodes an abundant nucleus-localized protein required for formation of female structures and for ascospore maturation. Deletion mutants of Asm-1+ are ""ascus-dominant,"" i.e., when crossed to wild type, neither Asm-1+ nor Asm-1 delta spores mature. To explain this behavior, we considered three models: an effect of reduced dosage of the gene product, failure of internuclear communication, and failure of transvection (regulation dependent on pairing of alleles). We found that for proper regulation of subsequent sexual sporulation, Asm-1+ must be in proximity, probably paired, to its allelic counterpart in the zygote: i.e., transvection must occur. Disruption of pairing causes failure of ascospore progeny to mature. Transvection in Neurospora, unlike in Drosophila, occurs immediately before meiosis, and can be demonstrated between wild-type alleles.",1996,"R L Metzenberg, R Aramayo"
"Regulation, function and potential origin of the Drosophila gene spalt adjacent, which encodes a secreted protein expressed in the early embryo",8601339,10.1007/BF00352268,"During early embryogenesis of Drosophila the spatial and temporal expression patterns of the region-specific homeotic gene spalt (sal) and the neighbouring gene spalt adjacent (sala) extensively overlap. We show that the initial expression patterns of the two genes in the blastoderm also have identical genetic controls. However, while sal encodes a transcription factor, sala encodes a precursor protein from which a functional signal peptide is cleaved off to generate the secreted sala protein. Ectopic expression or absence of sala protein does not affect embryonic development, adult viability or fertility. In addition to sal and sala, we identified a third gene nearby, termed spalt related (salr), which shares coding sequence similarity and a late embryonic expression pattern with sal, but lacks the early expression domains that are shared by sal and sala. These results suggest that the three genes and their present cis-regulatory regions arose through a chromosomal rearrangement involving local duplication and transposition events in the 32F/33A region on the left arm of the second chromosome.",1996,"H Jäckle, G Frommer, F C Kafatos, R Schuh, R Barrio, R P Kühnlein, D Reuter"
EGF receptor signaling induces pointed P1 transcription and inactivates Yan protein in the Drosophila embryonic ventral ectoderm,8951052,,"The induction of different cell fates along the dorsoventral axis of the Drosophila embryo requires a graded activity of the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase (DER). Here we have identified primary and secondary target genes of DER, which mediate the determination of discrete ventral cell fates. High levels of DER activation in the ventralmost cells trigger expression of the transcription factors encoded by ventral nervous system defective (vnd) and pointed P1 (pntPl). Concomitant with the induction of pntP1, high levels of DER activity lead to inactivation of the Yan protein, a transcriptional repressor of Pointed-target genes. These two antagonizing transcription factors subsequently control the expression of secondary target genes such as otd, argos and tartan. The simultaneous effects of the DER pathway on pntP1 induction and Yan inactivation may contribute to the definition of the border of the ventralmost cell fates.",1996,"L Gabay, B Z Shilo, M Golembo, A Klaes, H Scholz, C Klämbt"
Truncated mammalian Notch1 activates CBF1/RBPJk-repressed genes by a mechanism resembling that of Epstein-Barr virus EBNA2,8622698,10.1128/mcb.16.3.952,"The Notch/Lin-12/Glp-1 receptor family participates in cell-cell signaling events that influence cell fate decisions. Although several Notch homologs and receptor ligands have been identified, the nuclear events involved in this pathway remain incompletely understood. A truncated form of Notch, consisting only of the intracellular domain (NotchIC), localizes to the nucleus and functions as an activated receptor. Using both an in vitro binding assay and a cotransfection assay based on the two-hybrid principle, we show that mammalian NotchIC interacts with the transcriptional repressor CBF1, which is the human homolog of Drosophila Suppressor of Hairless. Cotransfection assays using segments of mouse NotchIC and CBF1 demonstrated that the N-terminal 114-amino-acid region of mouse NotchIC contains the CBF1 interactive domain and that the cdc10/ankyrin repeats are not essential for this interaction. This result was confirmed in immunoprecipation assays in which the N-terminal 114-amino-acid segment of NotchIC, but not the ankyrin repeat region, coprecipitated with CBF1. Mouse NotchIC itself is targeted to the transcriptional repression domain (aa179 to 361) of CBF1. Furthermore, transfection assays in which mouse NotchIC was targeted through Gal4-CBF1 or through endogenous cellular CBF1 indicated that NotchIC transactivates gene expression via CBF1 tethering to DNA. Transactivation by NotchIC occurs partially through abolition of CBF1-mediated repession. This same mechanism is used by Epstein-Barr virus EBNA2. Thus, mimicry of Notch signal transduction is involved in Epstein-Barr virus-driven immortalization.",1996,"T Henkel, E Robey, S D Hayward, P Salmon, M G Peterson, J J Hsieh"
Acclimation and selection for increased resistance to thermal stress in Drosophila buzzatii,8852846,,"Direct selection for increased resistance to a heat shock (41.9 degrees for 90 min) was carried out using two replicate lines of Drosophila buzzatii that were derived from a large base population. Selected individuals were first acclimated to high temperature before selection, while control individuals were acclimated but not selected, and selection was performed every second generation. Resistance to heat shock with acclimation increased in selected lines. Without acclimation, a correlated smaller increase in heat-shock resistance was suggested. Survival of males was higher than that of females in all lines when tested with acclimation, but with direct exposure to high temperatures, survival of females was greater than that of males both in selection and control lines but not in the base population. From analysis of reciprocal cross progeny between lines, one selection line was found to possess a dominant autosomal factor that significantly increased resistance of males much more than resistance of females. Also suggestive was recessive traits on the X chromosome in both selection lines that increased thermotolerance. No cytoplasmic effects were found. After accounting for other effects, survival of F1 flies was intermediate, suggesting that additive variation is present for one or more of the autosomes.",1996,"R A Krebs, V Loeschcke"

A heat shock-inducible promoter coupled to the expression of beta-gal, hsp70-lacZ, revealed that the rate and amount of induction of beta-gal after heat shock is preserved during aging but the rate of decay of beta-gal may be slightly delayed in older animals.

Fab-7 functions as a chromatin domain boundary to ensure proper segment specification by the Drosophila bithorax complex,8985188,10.1101/gad.10.24.3202,"Fab-7 deletions in the bithorax complex have a novel gain-of-function phenotype, typically transforming parasegment 11 (PS11) into PS12 identity. Genetic analysis indicates that removal of the Fab-7 element results in the fusion of the iab-6 (PS11) and iab-7 (PS12) cis-regulatory domains into a single regulatory domain that inappropriately regulates Abdominal-B in PS11. This has led to the hypothesis that Fab-7 is a chromatin domain boundary that normally functions to ensure the autonomous activity of the iab-6 and iab-7 cis-regulatory domains. We use several different enhancer blocking assays to demonstrate that Fab-7 has the insulating properties expected of a domain boundary. We define a minimal fragment of Fab-7 sufficient for enhancer blocking, and demonstrate that it is completely distinct from an adjacent Polycomb-dependent silencer. We compare Fab-7 to the su(Hw) insulator element, and show that Fab-7 enhancer blocking activity is intermediate between that of five and twelve reiterated binding sites for the Su(Hw) protein. These results support the model that Fab-7 functions as a domain boundary within the context of the bithorax complex, making Fab-7 one of the first boundary elements that is known to have an essential function in vivo.",1996,"P Schedl, M Muller, K Hagstrom"

Five other pair-rule genes and several other loci that affect the larval cuticular pattern do not detectably affect ftz expression. No simple regulatory relationships can be deduced.

Cis-acting sequences which regulate expression of the Sgs-4 glue protein gene of Drosophila,2430796,,"The Sgs-4 glue protein gene of Drosophila is expressed only in third-instar larval salivary glands.

Here we demonstrate by germ line transformation of cloned fragments containing Sgs-4 that the sequences between 840 bp 5' and 130 bp 3' to the gene are sufficient for Sgs-4 activity. When 5' sequence was removed to -392, activity was eliminated, thereby verifying the existence of essential sequences far upstream. Fragments that are active include, in addition to the capacity for normal levels of expression, three other cis-acting regulatory activities: developmental timing, tissue specificity, and dosage compensation. In contrast, the fragments tested did not specify formation of the puff with which Sgs-4 is normally associated. As shown by chromosomal rearrangements, the region required for puffing is limited to 16-19 kb surrounding the gene.",1986,"S K Beckendorf, S L McNabb"

The fraction of nuclei with blocks was considerably increased in dorvar7/0 males, especially at 18 degrees C when the viability of these males is sharply reduced. The following features distinguish the blocks in males from those in females: (i) compaction of the 2B region in the males results in genetic inactivation only to a very small extent; (ii) the structure of the blocks in males is diffuse; and (iii) the male blocks still maintain some transcriptional activity as indicated by 3H-uridine incorporation.

However, H of polymorphic loci was very similar for 2DE and 1DE proteins; and for 17 of a total of 54 polymorphic proteins, 2DE detected three or four distinct alleles. The results suggest that the differing levels of variability widely seen with 1DE and 2DE are real and reflect differing intensities of functional constraint between different classes of structural loci.

"NTP Toxicology and Carcinogenesis Studies of 1,2-Epoxybutane (CAS No. 106-88-7) in F344/N Rats and B6C3F1 Mice (Inhalation Studies)",12732907,,"1,2-Epoxybutane was selected for study because it is a short-chain epoxide that had been shown to be mutagenic and because no carcinogenicity data were available. Approximately 8 million pounds of 1,2-epoxybutane are produced annually in the United States. The chemical is used primarily as a stabilizer in chlorinated hydrocarbon solvents. Single-Exposure, Fourteen-Day, and Thirteen-Week Studies: Single-exposure, 14-day, 13-week, and 2-year studies were conducted in F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice. The chemical was greater than 99% pure and was administered as a vapor by the inhalation route to mimic worker exposure; room air was used as the control exposure during these studies. Exposures were 6 hours per day (5 days per week), except in the single-exposure studies (4 hours). Additional studies were performed to evaluate the potential for genetic damage in bacteria and in mammalian cells. In the single-exposure studies, the chemical was administered at exposure concentrations of 400-6,550 ppm in rats and 400-2,050 ppm in mice. In the 14-day studies, rats and mice were exposed at 400-6,400 ppm, and in the 13-week studies, rats and mice were exposed at 50-800 ppm. All rats in the single-exposure studies at 6,550 ppm died; compound-related deaths were not seen in other dosed groups. All mice at 2,050 ppm and 4/5 mice of each sex at 1,420 ppm died; compound-related mortality was not seen in other dosed groups. In the 14-day studies, all rats at 3,200 and 6,400 ppm and 2/5 female rats at 1,600 ppm died; all mice at 1,600, 3,200, and 6,400 and 1/5 male mice at 800 ppm died. Final mean body weights of surviving rats exposed at 800 or 1,600 ppm were 12%-33% lower than those of the controls; final mean body weights of surviving mice at 800 ppm were 10%-12% lower than those of the controls. Compound-related lesions included pulmonary hemorrhage and rhinitis in rats at 1,600 ppm and nephrosis in mice at 800 and 1,600 ppm. In the 13-week studies, no compound-related mortality was observed in rats; all mice exposed at 800 ppm died. No compound-related clinical signs were seen in rats or in surviving mice. The final mean body weight of rats exposed at 800 ppm was 23% lower than that of controls for males and 16% lower for females. Final body weights of surviving mice were unaffected by exposure. Inflammation of the nasal turbinates was seen in rats at 800 ppm but not at lower exposure concentrations. Renal tubular necrosis was seen in mice at 800 ppm but not at lowerconcentrations. Inflammation of the nasal turbinates was observed in female mice at 100, 200, 400, and 800 ppm and in male mice at 200, 400, and 800 ppm. The highest exposure concentration selected for the 2-year studies in rats was 400 ppm because of body weight effects and nasal lesions observed at 800 ppm. The highest concentration selected for the 2-year studies in mice was 100 ppm because the nasal lesions seen at 200 and 400 ppm were considered to be potentially life threatening. Two-Year Studies: The 2-year toxicology and carcinogenesis studies of 1,2-epoxybutane were conducted by exposing groups of 50 animals per species and sex to the chemical by inhalation, 6 hours per day 5 days per week. Rats were exposed at concentrations of 0, 200, or 400 ppm for 103 weeks and mice at 0, 50, or 100 ppm for 102 weeks. Body Weight and Survival in the Two-Year Studies: The survival of all groups of dosed rats was at least 50% until week 98, but final survival was reduced in the dosed groups (final survival-- male: control, 30/50; low dose, 18/50; high dose, 23/50; female: 32/50; 21/50; 22/50). Mean body weights of control and exposed male rats were similar until week 86; thereafter, mean body weights of high dose male rats were 4%-8% lower than those of controls. Mean body weights of high dose female rats were 5%-10% lower than those of controls after week 22. Survival in male mice was comparable among groups (final survival: 41/50; 45/50; 33/50). Survival in female mice was greater than 50% in all groups at week 86 and then was reduced in high dose females toward the end of the stin all groups at week 86 and then was reduced in high dose females toward the end of the study (final survival: 29/50; 25/50; 9/50). This decreased survival was associated with suppurative inflammation of the ovary and uterus. Klebsiella oxytoca was isolated from these ovarian/uterine lesions. Mean body weights of high dose male mice were 10&percnt;-14&percnt; lower than those of the controls after week 69; mean body weights of low dose male mice were 4&percnt;-8&percnt; lower than those of the controls after week 86. Mean body weights of high dose female mice were 13&percnt;-23&percnt; lower than those of the controls after week 60, and mean body weights of low dose female mice were 12&percnt;-16&percnt; lower than those of the controls after week 73. Nonneoplastic and Neoplastic Effects in the Two-Year Studies: Dosed rats had nonneoplastic lesions of the nasal cavity including inflammation, epithelial hyperplasia, squamous metaplasia, hyperostosis of the nasal turbinate bone, and atrophy of the olfactory epithelium. Seven papillary adenomas of the nasal cavity were seen in highdose male rats and two in high dose female rats. The historical incidences of nasal cavity adenomas in untreated male and untreated female F344/N rats are less than 0.1&percnt;. The incidences of alveolar/bronchiolar carcinomas (0/50; 1/50; 4/49) and adenomas or carcinomas (combined) (0/50; 2/50; 5/49) were increased in high dose male rats; no increased incidences of these tumors were observed in dosed female rats. Dosed mice had increased incidences of nonneoplastic lesions of the nasal cavity but no significant increase in the incidence of neoplastic lesions of the nasal cavity. The nonneoplastic lesions included suppurative inflammation (empyema), epithelial hyperplasia, erosion, regeneration, and squamous metaplasia in the nasal cavity; atrophy of the olfactory sensory epithelium; hyperplasia of the nasal gland (Bowman's glands); and inflammation and hyperplasia of the nasolacrimal duct. A single squamous cell papilloma was seen in the incisive duct of one high dose male mouse. Genetic Toxicology: 1,2-Epoxybutane was mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100 and TA1535 when tested with a preincubational protocol with or without rat liver S9, indicating that it is a direct-acting mutagen capable of inducing base-pair substitutions in prokaryotes; it did not cause gene reversion in strains TA1537 or TA98. 1,2-Epoxybutane induced forward mutations at the TK locus of cultured mouse L5178Y lymphoma cells with and without metabolic activation. Both chromosomal aberrations andsister chromatid exchanges were induced in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells after exposure to 1,2-epoxybutane in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. 1,2-Epoxybutane, when fed to male Drosophila, caused significant increases in the number of sex-linked recessive lethal mutations and reciprocal translocations in the germ cells. Data Audit: An audit of the experimental data was conducted for the 2-year studies of 1,2-epoxybutane. No data discrepancies were found that influenced the final interpretations. Conclusions: Under the conditions of these 2-year inhalation studies, there was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of 1,2-epoxybutane for male F344/N rats, as shown by an increased incidence of papillary adenomas of the nasal cavity, alveolar/bronchiolar carcinomas, and alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas and carcinomas (combined). There was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity for female F344/N rats, as shown by the presence of papillary adenomas of the nasal cavity. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity for male or female B6C3F1 mice exposed at 50 or 100 ppm. 1,2-Epoxybutane exposure was associated with adenomatous hyperplasia and inflammatory lesions of the nasal cavity in rats and inflammatory lesions of the nasal cavity in mice.

Drosophila small cytoplasmic 19S ribonucleoprotein is homologous to the rat multicatalytic proteinase,3123994,10.1038/331190a0,"All eukaryotic cells so far analysed contain 19S particles which share a cylinder-like shape and are composed of a set of proteins of relative molecular mass ranging typically from 19,000 to 36,000 (refs 1-10).

By means of electron microscopy, immunological techniques, RNA identification and proteinase activity assays, we were able to show that the two structurally similar complexes are immunologically related ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) with similar proteolytic activity.",1988,"P M Kloetzel, P E Falkenburg, B Niedel, F Kopp, L Kuehn, B Dahlmann, C Haass"
Changes in gene frequencies at the octanol dehydrogenase locus of Drosophila melanogaster imposed by environmental ethanol,3149601,10.1007/BF00122387,"Experiments have been performed to study the effect of selection at the Odh locus in Drosophila melanogaster populations using different alcohol concentrations in the medium. The data can be best interpreted by assuming frequency-dependent selection. When genotype frequencies are considered as independent variables and values of Wrightian fitness as dependent variables, it turns out that different functions describe the selection of the coexisting genotypes. A linear equation is used for the SF genotype and a hyperbolic function for the FF genotype. No function of good fit could be found for the SS genotype. Simulation experiments using these functions fit our data well.",1988,"K Pecsenye, G Lörincz"
Tired and stressed: Examining the need for sleep,30295966,10.1111/ejn.14197,"A key feature of circadian rhythms is the sleep/wake cycle. Sleep causes reduced responsiveness to the environment, which puts animals in a particularly vulnerable state; yet sleep has been conserved throughout evolution, indicating that it fulfils a vital purpose. A core function of sleep across species has not been identified, but substantial advances in sleep research have been made in recent years using the genetically tractable model organism, Drosophila melanogaster. This review describes the universality of sleep, the regulation of sleep, and current theories on the function of sleep, highlighting a historical and often overlooked theory called the Free Radical Flux Theory of Sleep. Additionally, we summarize our recent work with short-sleeping Drosophila mutants and other genetic and pharmacological tools for manipulating sleep which supports an antioxidant theory of sleep and demonstrates a bi-directional relationship between sleep and oxidative stress.",2020,"Reed M O'Connor, Mimi Shirasu-Hiza, Vanessa M Hill"
POU domain motif3 (Pdm3) induces wingless (wg) transcription and is essential for development of larval neuromuscular junctions in Drosophila,31949274,10.1038/s41598-020-57425-9,"Wnt is a conserved family of secreted proteins that play diverse roles in tissue growth and differentiation. Identification of transcription factors that regulate wnt expression is pivotal for understanding tissue-specific signaling pathways regulated by Wnt. We identified pdm3m7, a new allele of the pdm3 gene encoding a POU family transcription factor, in a lethality-based genetic screen for modifiers of Wingless (Wg) signaling in Drosophila. Interestingly, pdm3m7 larvae showed slow locomotion, implying neuromuscular defects. Analysis of larval neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) revealed decreased bouton number with enlarged bouton in pdm3 mutants. pdm3 NMJs also had fewer branches at axon terminals than wild-type NMJs. Consistent with pdm3m7 being a candidate wg modifier, NMJ phenotypes in pdm3 mutants were similar to those of wg mutants, implying a functional link between these two genes. Indeed, lethality caused by Pdm3 overexpression in motor neurons was completely rescued by knockdown of wg, indicating that Pdm3 acts upstream to Wg. Furthermore, transient expression of Pdm3 induced ectopic expression of wg-LacZ reporter and Wg effector proteins in wing discs. We propose that Pdm3 expressed in presynaptic NMJ neurons regulates wg transcription for growth and development of both presynaptic neurons and postsynaptic muscles.",2020,"Yeon Kim, Kyung-Ok Cho"
Drosophila Wash and the Wash regulatory complex function in nuclear envelope budding,32503943,10.1242/jcs.243576,"Nuclear envelope (NE) budding is a recently described phenomenon wherein large macromolecular complexes are packaged inside the nucleus and extruded through the nuclear membranes. Although a general outline of the cellular events occurring during NE budding is now in place, little is yet known about the molecular machinery and mechanisms underlying the physical aspects of NE bud formation. Using a multidisciplinary approach, we identify Wash, its regulatory complex (SHRC), capping protein and Arp2/3 as new molecular components involved in the physical aspects of NE bud formation in a Drosophila model system. Interestingly, Wash affects NE budding in two ways: indirectly through general nuclear lamina disruption via an SHRC-independent interaction with Lamin B leading to inefficient NE bud formation, and directly by blocking NE bud formation along with its SHRC, capping protein and Arp2/3. In addition to NE budding emerging as an important cellular process, it shares many similarities with herpesvirus nuclear egress mechanisms, suggesting new avenues for exploration in both normal and disease biology.",2020,"Kerri A Davidson, Vivek Nandakumar, Jacob R Decker, Susan M Parkhurst, Mitsutoshi Nakamura, Jeffrey M Verboon"
Non-invasive red-light optogenetic control of Drosophila cardiac function,32601302,10.1038/s42003-020-1065-3,"Drosophila is a powerful genetic model system for cardiovascular studies. Recently, optogenetic pacing tools have been developed to control Drosophila heart rhythm noninvasively with blue light, which has a limited penetration depth. Here we developed both a red-light sensitive opsin expressing Drosophila system and an integrated red-light stimulation and optical coherence microscopy (OCM) imaging system. We demonstrated noninvasive control of Drosophila cardiac rhythms using a single light source, including simulated tachycardia in ReaChR-expressing flies and bradycardia and cardiac arrest in halorhodopsin (NpHR)-expressing flies at multiple developmental stages. By using red excitation light, we were able to pace flies at higher efficiency and with lower power than with equivalent blue light excitation systems. The recovery dynamics after red-light stimulation of NpHR flies were observed and quantified. The combination of red-light stimulation, OCM imaging, and transgenic Drosophila systems provides a promising and easily manipulated research platform for noninvasive cardiac optogenetic studies.",2020,"Rudolph E Tanzi, Zilong Li, Chao Zhou, Jason Jerwick, Airong Li, Jing Men"
PiVR: An affordable and versatile closed-loop platform to study unrestrained sensorimotor behavior,32663220,10.1371/journal.pbio.3000712,"Tools enabling closed-loop experiments are crucial to delineate causal relationships between the activity of genetically labeled neurons and specific behaviors. We developed the Raspberry Pi Virtual Reality (PiVR) system to conduct closed-loop optogenetic stimulation of neural functions in unrestrained animals. PiVR is an experimental platform that operates at high temporal resolution (70 Hz) with low latencies (<30 milliseconds), while being affordable (<US$500) and easy to build (<6 hours). Through extensive documentation, this tool was designed to be accessible to a wide public, from high school students to professional researchers studying systems neuroscience. We illustrate the functionality of PiVR by focusing on sensory navigation in response to gradients of chemicals (chemotaxis) and light (phototaxis). We show how Drosophila adult flies perform negative chemotaxis by modulating their locomotor speed to avoid locations associated with optogenetically evoked bitter taste. In Drosophila larvae, we use innate positive chemotaxis to compare behavior elicited by real- and virtual-odor gradients. Finally, we examine how positive phototaxis emerges in zebrafish larvae from the modulation of turning maneuvers to orient in virtual white-light gradients. Besides its application to study chemotaxis and phototaxis, PiVR is a versatile tool designed to bolster efforts to map and to functionally characterize neural circuits.",2020,"David Tadres, Matthieu Louis"
Isolation and distribution of a Drosophila protein preferentially associated with inactive regions of the genome,3125020,10.1007/BF00285889,"The distribution patterns of chromosomal proteins from Drosophila can be observed by immunofluorescent staining of the polytene chromosomes from larval salivary glands. We have purified a non-histone chromosomal protein of Mr = 69,000 molecular weight which has a high affinity for DNA with little sequence specificity. Immunofluorescent staining indicates that this protein is preferentially associated with the inactive portions of the genome, including the centric heterochromatin and the condensed bands within the euchromatic arms of the chromosomes. Observation of both the heat shock loci 87A and 87C and the developmentally regulated loci 74EF and 75B shows an inverse correlation between immunofluorescent staining for the Mr = 69,000 protein and for RNA polymerase. The presence of this protein appears to be correlated with the packaging of the chromatin in an inactive form.",1987,"S C Elgin, R Filipski, G Fleischmann"
The gooseberry-zipper region of Drosophila: five genes encode different spatially restricted transcripts in the embryo,16453795,,"Genetic analysis of the Drosophila chromosome region 60 E9-F1 identified two functions affecting embryonic development; gooseberry (gsb), a segment polarity gene, and zipper (zip), an unclassified gene which affects cuticle formation severely. By contrast, molecular analysis revealed five genes with different temporal and spatial patterns of expression in the embryo. Candidate genes for gsb and zip functions were identified. Two adjacent genes are eventually expressed in regular stripes within the posterior region of each segment. One of them is expressed initially in a pair-rule mode; the second gene expresses reduced levels of transcripts in a mutant which leaves the transcribed region and the sequences up to the second gene intact. This observation, the patterns of transcripts in the embryo and the genetic data suggest that both genes are involved in gooseberry segmentation function. zip is expressed in neural tissue and not in epidermal anlagen. Embryos lacking zip activity also develop abnormal neural tissue consistent with the argument that the zip cuticle phenotype is a secondary effect. Additional newly identified genes are expressed in specific domains of the embryo, covering mesoderm anlagen and the dorsal region of embryos at blastoderm stage, respectively.",1987,"S Côté, A Kienlin, H Jäckle, R Schuh, E Seifert, A Preiss, J Haller"
The spontaneous mutation rate in Drosophila simulans,2825010,10.1016/0165-7992(87)90066-2,"The purpose of this investigation was to determine whether there exists a correlation in Drosophila between the spontaneous mutation rate and the amount of dispersed middle repetitive (mobile) DNA sequences. The amount of these sequences is 7 times less in Drosophila simulans as compared to Drosophila melanogaster. Therefore, if a correlation exists, the spontaneous mutation rate in Drosophila simulans should be 7 times lower than that in Drosophila melanogaster. We isolated an X-chromosome inversion after X-irradiation of wild-type Drosophila simulans males, that reduced crossing-over between white and forked, two X-linked visible markers, to less than 1%. This inversion was subsequently used to determine the sex-linked recessive lethal mutation rate in Drosophila simulans males of a laboratory strain marked with white. The frequency of these lethal mutations found is not different from that observed in Drosophila melanogaster males of laboratory strains.",1987,"J C Eeken, M M Green, A W de Jong"
Nucleotide sequence of the central non-transcribed spacer region of Physarum polycephalum rDNA,3005112,10.1016/0378-1119(85)90314-2,"In Physarum polycephalum the rRNA genes are present on linear extrachromosomal molecules, each containing two transcription units arranged as a giant palindrome. In the center of the molecule, between the two transcription units, is the 23-kb central spacer, previously shown to contain the replication origins and several regions of direct and inverted repeats. Segments of all the repeats in the spacer have been sequenced and their overall organization determined. The entire spacer consists of reiterations of only 1200 bp of different DNA sequences. The sequence surrounding the transcription start point is not repeated in the spacer, as it is in Xenopus and Drosophila. Sequencing of purified, uncloned rDNA localized some of the methylcytosine residues in the spacer. The repetitious sequences appear to be undergoing concerted evolution.",1985,P J Ferris
Ultrastructural observations on the cytoarchitecture of axons processed by rapid-freezing and freeze-substitution,2420942,10.1007/BF01224806,"The structure and organization of axons in the cervical connective of wild-type Drosophila fruit flies were examined in anticipation of studies of various neurological mutants. Dissected flies were rapid-frozen from the living state against a copper block cooled with liquid helium, freeze-substituted, and prepared for electron microscopic examination of thin sections. These cryotechniques showed new details of the structure of cell organelles and cytoplasm in Drosophila axons. The cytoplasmic matrix of axons and glia consists of a material with a fine granular texture enmeshed in a three-dimensional meshwork of short, fine filaments which vary in shape, size and electron density. No neurofilaments are present, but bundles of microtubules are interwoven into the filamentous matrix of the axoplasm. The round wall of microtubules (27 nm overall diameter) is composed of twelve cylindrical protofilaments with a typical substructural periodicity. Mitochondria frequently make contact with microtubules in both axons and glial processes. A thin layer of electron-dense filamentous matrix, which appears to be an axonal basal lamina, contacts most of the axonal exoplasmic surface, especially that of axons where they are surrounded by processes of glial cells, but is scant wherever single axons are contiguous. Thus, an axonal basal lamina occupies the constricted spaces around axons, where extracellular K+ accumulates during neural activity.",1985,"G Benshalom, T S Reese"
