Spiroplasma as a model insect endosymbiont,23761245,10.1111/j.1758-2229.2010.00240.x,"Members of the genus Spiroplasma are actively motile and helical bacteria of the class Mollicutes, which are associated with a variety of arthropods and plants. Some spiroplasmas cause female-biased sex ratios of their host insects as a result of selective death of the male offspring during embryogenesis. Several strains of male-killing spiroplasmas have been successfully transfected into Drosophila melanogaster by haemolymph injection and maintained in laboratory fly stocks. Spiroplasma-Drosophila endosymbiosis represents an ideal model system for analysing the molecular mechanisms underlying host-symbiont interactions. The infection dynamics exhibited by the symbiont within the host, the effects of external and environmental factors on the symbiotic association and symbiont interactions with the host's immune system have been investigated using this system. Comparisons between a male-killing Spiroplasma strain and its non-male-killing variant revealed that, in addition to different male-killing abilities, they also differed in infection dynamics and resistance to host innate immunity. It is currently unclear whether these different phenotypes are interconnected to each other. However, if so, such pleiotropy could facilitate our understanding of the genetic and molecular mechanisms of the endosymbiotic system.",2011,"Takema Fukatsu, Hisashi Anbutsu"
Multiple mechanisms collaborate to repress nanos translation in the Drosophila ovary and embryo,21460235,10.1261/rna.2478611,"Translational control of gene expression is essential for development in organisms that rely on maternal mRNAs. In Drosophila, translation of maternal nanos (nos) mRNA must be restricted to the posterior of the early embryo for proper patterning of the anterior-posterior axis. Spatial control of nos translation is coordinated through the localization of a small subset of nos mRNA to the posterior pole late in oogenesis, activation of this localized mRNA, and repression of the remaining unlocalized nos mRNA throughout the bulk cytoplasm. Translational repression is mediated by the interaction of a cis-acting element in the nos 3' untranslated region with two proteins, Glorund (Glo) and Smaug (Smg), that function in the oocyte and embryo, respectively. The mechanism of Glo-dependent repression is unknown. Previous work suggests that Smg represses translation initiation but this model is not easily reconciled with evidence for polysome association of repressed nos mRNA. Using an in vitro translation system, we have decoupled translational repression of nos imposed during oogenesis from repression during embryogenesis. Our results suggest that both Glo and Smg regulate translation initiation, but by different mechanisms. Furthermore, we show that, during late oogenesis, nos translation is also repressed post-initiation and provide evidence that Glo mediates this event. This post-initiation block is maintained into embryogenesis during the transition to Smg-dependent regulation. We propose that the use of multiple modes of repression ensures inactivation of nos RNA that is translated at earlier stages of oogenesis and maintenance of this inactivate state throughout late oogenesis into embryogenesis.",2011,"Elizabeth R Gavis, Ira E Clark, Shane Andrews, Danielle R Snowflack"
A Drosophila model for the Zellweger spectrum of peroxisome biogenesis disorders,21669930,10.1242/dmm.007419,"Human peroxisome biogenesis disorders are lethal genetic diseases in which abnormal peroxisome assembly compromises overall peroxisome and cellular function. Peroxisomes are ubiquitous membrane-bound organelles involved in several important biochemical processes, notably lipid metabolism and the use of reactive oxygen species for detoxification. Using cultured cells, we systematically characterized the peroxisome assembly phenotypes associated with dsRNA-mediated knockdown of 14 predicted Drosophila homologs of PEX genes (encoding peroxins; required for peroxisome assembly and linked to peroxisome biogenesis disorders), and confirmed that at least 13 of them are required for normal peroxisome assembly. We also demonstrate the relevance of Drosophila as a genetic model for the early developmental defects associated with the human peroxisome biogenesis disorders. Mutation of the PEX1 gene is the most common cause of peroxisome biogenesis disorders and is one of the causes of the most severe form of the disease, Zellweger syndrome. Inherited mutations in Drosophila Pex1 correlate with reproducible defects during early development. Notably, Pex1 mutant larvae exhibit abnormalities that are analogous to those exhibited by Zellweger syndrome patients, including developmental delay, poor feeding, severe structural abnormalities in the peripheral and central nervous systems, and early death. Finally, microarray analysis defined several clusters of genes whose expression varied significantly between wild-type and mutant larvae, implicating peroxisomal function in neuronal development, innate immunity, lipid and protein metabolism, gamete formation, and meiosis.",2011,"Sarah C Hughes, Andrew J Simmonds, Fred D Mast, Maninder K Virk, Richard A Rachubinski, Jing Li"
Global analysis of the relationship between JIL-1 kinase and transcription,21423663,10.1371/journal.pgen.1001327,"The ubiquitous tandem kinase JIL-1 is essential for Drosophila development. Its role in defining decondensed domains of larval polytene chromosomes is well established, but its involvement in transcription regulation has remained controversial. For a first comprehensive molecular characterisation of JIL-1, we generated a high-resolution, chromosome-wide interaction profile of the kinase in Drosophila cells and determined its role in transcription. JIL-1 binds active genes along their entire length. The presence of the kinase is not proportional to average transcription levels or polymerase density. Comparison of JIL-1 association with elongating RNA polymerase and a variety of histone modifications suggests two distinct targeting principles. A basal level of JIL-1 binding can be defined that correlates best with the methylation of histone H3 at lysine 36, a mark that is placed co-transcriptionally. The additional acetylation of H4K16 defines a second state characterised by approximately twofold elevated JIL-1 levels, which is particularly prominent on the dosage-compensated male X chromosome. Phosphorylation of the histone H3 N-terminus by JIL-1 in vitro is compatible with other tail modifications. In vivo, phosphorylation of H3 at serine 10, together with acetylation at lysine 14, creates a composite histone mark that is enriched at JIL-1 binding regions. Its depletion by RNA interference leads to a modest, but significant, decrease of transcription from the male X chromosome. Collectively, the results suggest that JIL-1 participates in a complex histone modification network that characterises active, decondensed chromatin. We hypothesise that one specific role of JIL-1 may be to reinforce, rather than to establish, the status of active chromatin through the phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10.",2011,"Viola Fabian, Angelika Mitterweger, Ina K Dahlsveen, Tobias Straub, Peter B Becker, Catherine Regnard"
Differential regulation of transcription through distinct Suppressor of Hairless DNA binding site architectures during Notch signaling in proneural clusters,21041480,10.1128/MCB.00003-10,"In Drosophila melanogaster, achaete (ac) and m8 are model basic helix-loop-helix activator (bHLH A) and repressor genes, respectively, that have the opposite cell expression pattern in proneural clusters during Notch signaling. Previous studies have shown that activation of m8 transcription in specific cells within proneural clusters by Notch signaling is programmed by a ""combinatorial"" and ""architectural"" DNA transcription code containing binding sites for the Su(H) and proneural bHLH A proteins. Here we show the novel result that the ac promoter contains a similar combinatorial code of Su(H) and bHLH A binding sites but contains a different Su(H) site architectural code that does not mediate activation during Notch signaling, thus programming a cell expression pattern opposite that of m8 in proneural clusters.",2011,"John W Cave, Michael Caudy, Li Xia"
A novel function for the PAR complex in subcellular morphogenesis of tracheal terminal cells in Drosophila melanogaster,21750259,10.1534/genetics.111.130351,"The processes that generate cellular morphology are not well understood. To investigate this problem, we use Drosophila melanogaster tracheal terminal cells, which undergo two distinct morphogenetic processes: subcellular branching morphogenesis and subcellular apical lumen formation. Here we show these processes are regulated by components of the PAR-polarity complex. This complex, composed of the proteins Par-6, Bazooka (Par-3), aPKC, and Cdc42, is best known for roles in asymmetric cell division and apical/basal polarity. We find Par-6, Bazooka, and aPKC, as well as known interactions between them, are required for subcellular branch initiation, but not for branch outgrowth. By analysis of single and double mutants, and isolation of two novel alleles of Par-6, one of which specifically truncates the Par-6 PDZ domain, we conclude that dynamic interactions between apical PAR-complex members control the branching pattern of terminal cells. These data suggest that canonical apical PAR-complex activity is required for subcellular branching morphogenesis. In addition, we find the PAR proteins are downstream of the FGF pathway that controls terminal cell branching. In contrast, we find that while Par-6 and aPKC are both required for subcellular lumen formation, neither Bazooka nor a direct interaction between Par-6 and aPKC is needed for this process. Thus a novel, noncanonical role for the polarity proteins Par-6 and aPKC is used in formation of this subcellular apical compartment. Our results demonstrate that proteins from the PAR complex can be deployed independently within a single cell to control two different morphogenetic processes.",2011,"Tiffani A Jones, Mark M Metzstein"
The kynurenine pathway modulates neurodegeneration in a Drosophila model of Huntington's disease,21636279,10.1016/j.cub.2011.04.028,"Neuroactive metabolites of the kynurenine pathway (KP) of tryptophan degradation have been implicated in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disorders, including Huntington's disease (HD) [1]. A central hallmark of HD is neurodegeneration caused by a polyglutamine expansion in the huntingtin (htt) protein [2]. Here we exploit a transgenic Drosophila melanogaster model of HD to interrogate the therapeutic potential of KP manipulation. We observe that genetic and pharmacological inhibition of kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO) increases levels of the neuroprotective metabolite kynurenic acid (KYNA) relative to the neurotoxic metabolite 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK) and ameliorates neurodegeneration. We also find that genetic inhibition of tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO), the first and rate-limiting step in the pathway, leads to a similar neuroprotective shift toward KYNA synthesis. Importantly, we demonstrate that the feeding of KYNA and 3-HK to HD model flies directly modulates neurodegeneration, underscoring the causative nature of these metabolites. This study provides the first genetic evidence that inhibition of KMO and TDO activity protects against neurodegenerative disease in an animal model, indicating that strategies targeted at two key points within the KP may have therapeutic relevance in HD, and possibly other neurodegenerative disorders.",2011,"Korrapati V Sathyasaikumar, Robert Schwarcz, Edward W Green, Carlo Breda, Susanna Campesan, Charalambos P Kyriacou, Flaviano Giorgini, Paul J Muchowski"
The autism candidate gene Neurobeachin encodes a scaffolding protein implicated in membrane trafficking and signaling,21375492,10.2174/156652411795243432,"Autism is a developmental disorder of the central nervous system characterized by impairments in social interaction, communication and restricted repetitive and stereotyped behavior. It is generally assumed that in most cases autism has a polygenic cause, but the pathogenesis is still unknown. Neurobeachin (NBEA) has recently been identified as a candidate gene for autism in a patient with a de novo chromosomal translocation and three patients with a monoallelic deletion. This multidomain scaffolding protein has been suggested to be involved in neuronal post-Golgi membrane traffic. Knockout of Nbea in two independent mouse models has demonstrated a role in neurotransmitter release and synaptic functioning. Knockdown in a cell line has shown a role as negative regulator of secretion of large dense-core vesicles (LDCVs) and haploinsufficiency in blood platelets results in dense granules with an aberrant morphology. A potential role in vesicle transport is further supported by a study of SEL-2, the C.elegans homologue of NBEA. This protein was identified as a negative regulator of LIN-12/Notch activity, probably due to defects in endosomal trafficking. Members of the Notch pathway have also been shown to be modifiers of the NBEA homologue in Drosophila, rugose. These new insights in the function of NBEA may help identifying novel pathways affected in autistic patients. In particular, it suggests that impaired functionality of LDCVs, which contain neurotrophins, neuropeptides and monoamines, might contribute to the pathogenesis of autism in at least a subgroup of patients.",2011,"J W M Creemers, K Nuytens, K Volders"
"NEDD9 and BCAR1 negatively regulate E-cadherin membrane localization, and promote E-cadherin degradation",21765937,10.1371/journal.pone.0022102,"The Cas scaffolding proteins (NEDD9/HEF1/CAS-L, BCAR1/p130Cas, EFSSIN, and HEPL/CASS4) regulate cell migration, division and survival, and are often deregulated in cancer. High BCAR1 expression is linked to poor prognosis in breast cancer patients, while upregulation of NEDD9 contributes to the metastatic behavior of melanoma and glioblastoma cells. Our recent work knocking out the single Drosophila Cas protein, Dcas, identified a genetic interaction with E-cadherin. As E-cadherin is often downregulated during epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) prior to metastasis, if such an activity was conserved in mammals it might partially explain how Cas proteins promote aggressive tumor behavior. We here establish that Cas proteins negatively regulate E-cadherin expression in human mammary cells. Cas proteins do not affect E-cadherin transcription, but rather, BCAR1 and NEDD9 signal through SRC to promote E-cadherin removal from the cell membrane and lysosomal degradation. We also find mammary tumors arising in MMTV-polyoma virus T-antigen mice have enhanced junctional E-cadherin in a Nedd9(-/-) background. Cumulatively, these results suggest a new role for Cas proteins in cell-cell adhesion signaling in cancer.",2011,"Nadezhda Tikhmyanova, Erica A Golemis"
Apple polyphenols extend the mean lifespan of Drosophila melanogaster,21319854,10.1021/jf1046267,"Apple polyphenols (AP) are an excellent source of dietary antioxidants. The present study investigated the effect of AP on the lifespan of fruit flies and their interaction with gene expressions of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), methuselah (MTH), Rpn11, and cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) subunits III and VIb. Results showed the mean lifespan was significantly extended by 10% in fruit flies fed the AP diet. This was accompanied by up-regulation of genes SOD1, SOD2, and CAT and down-regulation of MTH in the aged fruit flies. Paraquat and H(2)O(2) challenge tests demonstrated that AP prolonged the survival time only for Oregon R wild type flies but not for SOD(n108) or Cat(n1) mutants, in which either SOD or CAT was knocked out. Chronic paraquat exposure could shorten the maximum lifespan from 68 to 31 days and reduce the climbing ability by 60%, whereas AP could partially reverse the paraquat-induced mortality and decline in climbing ability. AP could up-regulate Rpn11 at day 30, whereas it appeared to have no significant effect on gene expression of ubiquitinated protein, CcO subunits III and VIb. These AP-induced changes were unlikely associated with caloric restriction as the gustatory assay found no difference in average body weight and stomach redness index between the control and AP fruit flies. It was therefore concluded that the antiaging activity of AP was, at least in part, mediated by its interaction with genes SOD, CAT, MTH, and Rpn11.",2011,"Zhen-Yu Chen, Ho Yin Edwin Chan, Cheng Peng, Yu Huang, Hongjian Yu"
Genome-wide examination of the transcriptional response to ecdysteroids 20-hydroxyecdysone and ponasterone A in Drosophila melanogaster,21958154,10.1186/1471-2164-12-475,"Background: The 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) hierarchy of gene activation serves as an attractive model system for studying the mode of steroid hormone regulated gene expression and development. Many structural analogs of 20E exist in nature and among them the plant-derived ponasterone A (PoA) is the most potent. PoA has a higher affinity for the 20E nuclear receptor, composed of the ecysone receptor (EcR) and Ultraspiracle proteins, than 20E and a comparison of the genes regulated by these hormones has not been performed. Furthermore, in Drosophila different cell types elicit different morphological responses to 20E yet the cell type specificity of the 20E transcriptional response has not been examined on a genome-wide scale. We aim to characterize the transcriptional response to 20E and PoA in Drosophila Kc cells and to 20E in salivary glands and provide a robust comparison of genes involved in each response. Results: Our genome-wide microarray analysis of Kc167 cells treated with 20E or PoA revealed that far more genes are regulated by PoA than by 20E (256 vs 148 respectively) and that there is very little overlap between the transcriptional responses to each hormone. Interestingly, genes induced by 20E relative to PoA are enriched in functions related to development. We also find that many genes regulated by 20E in Kc167 cells are not regulated by 20E in salivary glands of wandering 3rd instar larvae and we show that 20E-induced levels of EcR isoforms EcR-RA, ER-RC, and EcR-RD/E differ between Kc cells and salivary glands suggesting a possible cause for the observed differences in 20E-regulated gene transcription between the two cell types. Conclusions: We report significant differences in the transcriptional responses of 20E and PoA, two steroid hormones that differ by only a single hydroxyl group. We also provide evidence that suggests that PoA induced death of non-adapted insects may be related to PoA regulating different set of genes when compared to 20E. In addition, we reveal large differences between Kc cells and salivary glands with regard to their genome-wide transcriptional response to 20E and show that the level of induction of certain EcR isoforms differ between Kc cells and salivary glands. We hypothesize that the differences in the transcriptional response may in part be due to differences in the EcR isoforms present in different cell types.",2011,"Amy S Kehoe, J Timothy Westwood, Scott J Neal, Sarah E Gonsalves"
Antimutagenic activity of two medicinal phytoextracts in somatic cells of Drosophila melanogaster,21391834,10.3109/13880209.2010.527992,"Context and objective: We used the wing somatic assay in Drosophila melanogaster to test the hypothesis that two phytoextracts from Cecropia obtusifolia Bertol (Cecropiaceae) and Equisetum myriochaetum Schlecht. et Cham (Equisetaceae), which are used in folk medicine to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus, could detoxify the mutagen hydrogen peroxide. Materials and methods: Third instar larvae from standard (ST) and high-bioactivation (HB) crosses were chronically exposed to different concentrations of the phytoextracts. Hydrogen peroxide was used to induce oxidative stress and was chronically tested in both crosses. Catalase activity was measured in larvae of both strains 48 h after treatment with hydrogen peroxide. A pretreatment protocol was devised to test the antimutagenic potency of the medicinal extracts. Results: The present study showed that neither of the phytoextracts were genotoxic in Drosophila. Interestingly, the antioxidant enzyme activity levels were different between the larvae. Hydrogen peroxide resulted in a significant genotoxic effect in the ST cross, whereas a detoxification of hydrogen peroxide was found in the HB cross. Thus, catalase was stimulated in the HB cross, which was indicative of a cellular defense mechanism mounted against a xenobiotic hazard. We found that the percentage of inhibition of spots produced by E. myriochaetum was much higher than that induced by Cecropia obtusifolia. Discussion and conclusions: These results are in agreement with the uses of these phytoextracts in traditional medicine. Indeed, the lack of genotoxicity and the antimutagenic activity observed for both phytoextracts validates their use as a therapeutic modality to treat diabetic patients. Moreover, these extracts are suitable for consumption as teas and/or phytomedicines.",2011,"América Nitxin Castañeda Sortibrán, Claudia Segal Kischinevzky, María Guadalupe Ordaz Téllez, Adolfo Andrade-Cetto, Rosario Rodríguez-Arnaiz"
"Role of PDZ proteins in regulating trafficking, signaling, and function of GPCRs: means, motif, and opportunity",21907913,10.1016/B978-0-12-385952-5.00003-8,"PDZ proteins, named for the common structural domain shared by the postsynaptic density protein (PSD95), Drosophila disc large tumor suppressor (DlgA), and zonula occludens-1 protein (ZO-1), constitute a family of 200-300 recognized members. These cytoplasmic adapter proteins are capable of assembling a variety of membrane-associated proteins and signaling molecules in short-lived functional units. Here, we review PDZ proteins that participate in the regulation of signaling, trafficking, and function of G protein-coupled receptors. Salient structural features of PDZ proteins that allow them to recognize targeted GPCRs are considered. Scaffolding proteins harboring PDZ domains may contain single or multiple PDZ modules and may also include other protein-protein interaction modules. PDZ proteins may impact receptor signaling by diverse mechanisms that include retaining the receptor at the cell membrane, thereby increasing the duration of ligand binding, as well as importantly influencing GPCR internalization, trafficking, recycling, and intracellular sorting. PDZ proteins are also capable of modifying the assembled complex of accessory proteins such as β-arrestins that themselves regulate GPCR signaling. Additionally, PDZ proteins may modulate GPCR signaling by altering the G protein to which the receptor binds, or affect other regulatory proteins that impact GTPase activity, protein kinase A, phospholipase C, or modify downstream signaling events. Small molecules targeting the PDZ protein-GPCR interaction are being developed and may become important and selective drug candidates.",2011,"Peter A Friedman, Mark von Zastrow, Guillermo Romero"
A population genetics-phylogenetics approach to inferring natural selection in coding sequences,22144911,10.1371/journal.pgen.1002395,"Through an analysis of polymorphism within and divergence between species, we can hope to learn about the distribution of selective effects of mutations in the genome, changes in the fitness landscape that occur over time, and the location of sites involved in key adaptations that distinguish modern-day species. We introduce a novel method for the analysis of variation in selection pressures within and between species, spatially along the genome and temporally between lineages. We model codon evolution explicitly using a joint population genetics-phylogenetics approach that we developed for the construction of multiallelic models with mutation, selection, and drift. Our approach has the advantage of performing direct inference on coding sequences, inferring ancestral states probabilistically, utilizing allele frequency information, and generalizing to multiple species. We use a Bayesian sliding window model for intragenic variation in selection coefficients that efficiently combines information across sites and captures spatial clustering within the genome. To demonstrate the utility of the method, we infer selective pressures acting in Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans from polymorphism and divergence data for 100 X-linked coding regions.",2011,"Molly Przeworski, Peter Andolfatto, Daniel J Wilson, Ryan D Hernandez"

The loss-of-function mutation rho-7 results in semi-lethality, while escapers have a reduced lifespan with several neurological disorders [1]. Here we show that general, or CNS-specific expression of rho-7 can rescue the lethality of rho-7. General, or CNS-specific over-expression of rho-7 in otherwise wild-type animals caused semi-lethality, with approximately 50% of the animals escaping this lethality, developing into adults displaying a shortened life span with larval locomotory problem. On a cellular level, over-expression resulted in severe depression of ATP levels and cytochrome c oxidase subunit II mRNA levels, a lowered number of mitochondria in neurons and aggregation of mitochondria in the brain indicating mitochondrial malfunction. Over-expression of rho-7 in developing eye discs resulted in an elevated apoptotic index. In the CNS, elevated levels of rho-7 were accompanied by both isoforms of Opa1-like, a dynamin-like GTPase, a mitochondrial component involved in regulating mitochondrial dynamics and function, including apoptosis.

We report that src64 is maternally expressed in the Drosophila embryo and acts primarily as a maternal gene during cellularization. However, we show that src64 has some zygotic activity during late cellularization. By using compound chromosomes to generate embryos with wild-type levels of maternal src64 activity, we show that this zygotic activity is normally nonessential. We also report the identification of an alternate src64 transcript.

Moreover, tissue-specific overexpression of dPGC-1 in stem and progenitor cells within the digestive tract extends life span. Long-lived flies overexpressing dPGC-1 display a delay in the onset of aging-related changes in the intestine, leading to improved tissue homeostasis in old flies. Together, these results demonstrate that dPGC-1 can slow aging both at the level of cellular changes in an individual tissue and also at the organismal level by extending life span.

Drosophila pupal abdomen immunohistochemistry,21988937,10.3791/3139,"The Drosophila pupal abdomen is an established model system for the study of epithelial morphogenesis and the development of sexually dimorphic morphologies. During pupation, which spans approximately 96 hours (at 25 °C), proliferating populations of imaginal cells replace the larval epidermis to generate the adult abdominal segments. These imaginal cells, born during embryogenesis, exist as lateral pairs of histoblast nests in each abdominal segment of the larvae. Four pairs of histoblast nests give rise to the adult dorsal cuticle (anterior and posterior dorsal nests), the ventral cuticle (ventral nests) and the spiracles associated with each segment (spiracle nests). Upon puparation, these diploid cells (distinguishable by size from the larger polyploid larval epidermal cells- LECs) begin a stereotypical process of proliferation, migration and replacement of the LECs. Various molecular and genetic tools can be employed to investigate the contributions of genetic pathways involved in morphogenesis of the adult abdomen. Ultimate adult phenotypes are typically analyzed following dissection of adult abdominal cuticles. However, investigation of the underlying molecular processes requires immunohistochemical analyses of the pupal epithelium, which present unique challenges. Temporally dynamic morphogenesis and the interactions of two distinct epithelial populations (larval and imaginal) generate a fragile tissue prone to excessive cell loss during dissection and subsequent processing.

Bacterial communities of diverse Drosophila species: ecological context of a host-microbe model system,21966276,10.1371/journal.pgen.1002272,"Drosophila melanogaster is emerging as an important model of non-pathogenic host-microbe interactions. The genetic and experimental tractability of Drosophila has led to significant gains in our understanding of animal-microbial symbiosis. However, the full implications of these results cannot be appreciated without the knowledge of the microbial communities associated with natural Drosophila populations. In particular, it is not clear whether laboratory cultures can serve as an accurate model of host-microbe interactions that occur in the wild, or those that have occurred over evolutionary time. To fill this gap, we characterized natural bacterial communities associated with 14 species of Drosophila and related genera collected from distant geographic locations. To represent the ecological diversity of Drosophilids, examined species included fruit-, flower-, mushroom-, and cactus-feeders. In parallel, wild host populations were compared to laboratory strains, and controlled experiments were performed to assess the importance of host species and diet in shaping bacterial microbiome composition. We find that Drosophilid flies have taxonomically restricted bacterial communities, with 85% of the natural bacterial microbiome composed of only four bacterial families. The dominant bacterial taxa are widespread and found in many different host species despite the taxonomic, ecological, and geographic diversity of their hosts. Both natural surveys and laboratory experiments indicate that host diet plays a major role in shaping the Drosophila bacterial microbiome. Despite this, the internal bacterial microbiome represents only a highly reduced subset of the external bacterial communities, suggesting that the host exercises some level of control over the bacteria that inhabit its digestive tract. Finally, we show that laboratory strains provide only a limited model of natural host-microbe interactions.

Cyclic presence and absence of conspecifics alters circadian clock phase but does not entrain the locomotor activity rhythm of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster,21797778,10.3109/07420528.2011.591018,"Circadian clocks use a wide range of environmental cues, including cycles of light, temperature, food, and social interactions, to fine-tune rhythms in behavior and physiology. Although social cues have been shown to influence circadian clocks of a variety of organisms including the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, their mechanism of action is still unclear. Here, the authors report the results of their study aimed at investigating if daily cycles of presence and absence (PA) of conspecific male visitors are able to entrain the circadian locomotor activity rhythm of male hosts living under constant darkness (DD). The results suggest that PA cycles may not be able to entrain circadian locomotor activity rhythms of Drosophila. The outcome does not change when male hosts are presented with female visitors, suggesting that PA cycles of either sex may not be effective in bringing about stable entrainment of circadian clocks in D. melanogaster. However, in hosts whose clock phase has already been set by light/dark (LD) cycles, daily PA cycles of visitors can cause measurable change in the phase of subsequent free-running rhythms, provided that their circadian clocks are labile. Thus, the findings of this study suggest that D. melanogaster males may not be using cyclic social cues as their primary zeitgeber (time cue) for entrainment of circadian clocks, although social cues are capable of altering the phase of their circadian rhythms.",2011,"Madhumala K Sadanandappa, Shahnaz Rahman Lone, Vijay Kumar Sharma"
Coenzyme Q plays opposing roles on bacteria/fungi and viruses in Drosophila innate immunity,21518260,10.1111/j.1744-313X.2011.01012.x,"Coenzyme Q (CoQ or ubiquinone) is a lipid-soluble component of virtually all types of cell membranes and has been shown to play multiple metabolic functions. Several clinical diseases including encephalomyopathy, cerebellar ataxia and isolated myopathy were shown to be associated with CoQ deficiency. However, the role of CoQ in immunity has not been defined. In the present study, we showed that flies defective in CoQ biosynthetic gene coq2 were more susceptible to bacterial and fungal infections, while were more resistant to viruses. We found that Drosophila contained both CoQ9 and CoQ10, and food supplement of CoQ10 could partially rescue the impaired immune functions of coq2 mutants. Surprisingly, wild-type flies fed CoQ10 became more susceptible to viral infection, which suggested that extra caution should be taken when using CoQ10 as a food supplement. We further showed that CoQ was essential for normal induction of anti-microbial peptides and amplification of viruses. Our work determined CoQ content in Drosophila and described its function in immunity for the first time.",2011,"M Chen, H Zhou, W Cheng, D Li, W Wang, C Song, K M Anjum, J Chen"
"Drosophila intersex orthologue in the silkworm, Bombyx mori and related species",21120683,10.1007/s10709-010-9529-x,"Intersex (ix), a gene required for female sexual development in Drosophila, acts in concert with doublesex (dsx) at the end of the sex determination pathway. In the present study a homologue of ix was identified in Bombyx mori. Expression analysis of this gene by RT-PCR and RNase protection assay revealed a diagnostic alternative splice form present only in testis, whereas the most common splice form was found to express in all other tissues from early embryonic developmental stages. The present study provides evidence for the presence of an alternative splice form of ix in three species of silkmoths examined. Taken together with the results of an earlier study on ix in piralid moth, Maruca vitrata (Cavaliere et al. 2009), the present study suggests that the testis-specific splice form may be a characteristic feature of lepidopterans. Though ix lacks a conserved splicing pattern it appears to have retained its functional conservation in terminal sexual differentiation. We speculate that the presence of an additional splice form, perhaps encoding non-functional protein only in testis, may prevent the feminizing effects exerted by the functional IX protein.",2011,"K P Arunkumar, J Nagaraju"
Microscale MALDI imaging of outer-layer lipids in intact egg chambers from Drosophila melanogaster,21520886,10.1021/ac200481j,"Fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) is a standard model organism used in genetics and molecular biology. Phospholipids are building blocks of cellular membranes, and components of a complex signaling network. Here, we present a facile method, based on matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry (MS), for molecular imaging of phospholipid distributions in submillimeter-sized components of the fruit fly reproductive system. Individual egg chambers were deposited on a specially prepared MALDI target comprising an aluminum slide with a rough surface created by ablation with a microsecond-laser: this helped to immobilize biological specimens, remove excess of saline solution by adhesive forces, carry out microscopic observations, and facilitated distribution of the MALDI matrix. A continuous-flow ultrasound-assisted spray was used for the deposition of MALDI matrix (9-aminoacridine) onto the sample. The upper surface of the specimen was then scanned with a 355-nm solid-state laser with a preset beam focus of 10 μm to obtain negative-ion mode MALDI-MS images. Overall, this provided sufficient spatial resolution to reveal micrometer-scale gradient-like patterns of phospholipids along the anterior/posterior axis of egg chambers. Several phosphatidylinositols are seen to be segregated according to the number of unsaturated bonds, with an elevated abundance of polyunsaturated phosphatidylinositols within the oocyte compartment.",2011,"Pawel L Urban, June-Tai Wu, Yu-Chie Chen, Chia-Hsien Chang"

As a genetically tractable model, the fly facilitates gene discovery and can complement mammalian models of disease.

Francisella-arthropod vector interaction and its role in patho-adaptation to infect mammals,21687425,10.3389/fmicb.2011.00034,"Francisella tularensis is a Gram-negative, intracellular, zoonotic bacterium, and is the causative agent of tularemia with a broad host range. Arthropods such as ticks, mosquitoes, and flies maintain F. tularensis in nature by transmitting the bacteria among small mammals. While the tick is largely believed to be a biological vector of F. tularensis, transmission by mosquitoes and flies is largely believed to be mechanical on the mouthpart through interrupted feedings. However, the mechanism of infection of the vectors by F. tularensis is not well understood. Since F. tularensis has not been localized in the salivary gland of the primary human biting ticks, it is thought that bacterial transmission by ticks is through mechanical inoculation of tick feces containing F. tularensis into the skin wound. Drosophila melanogaster is an established good arthropod model for arthropod vectors of tularemia, where F. tularensis infects hemocytes, and is found in hemolymph, as seen in ticks. In addition, phagosome biogenesis and robust intracellular proliferation of F. tularensis in arthropod-derived cells are similar to that in mammalian macrophages. Furthermore, bacterial factors required for infectivity of mammals are often required for infectivity of the fly by F. tularensis. Several host factors that contribute to F. tularensis intracellular pathogenesis in D. melanogaster have been identified, and F. tularensis targets some of the evolutionarily conserved eukaryotic processes to enable intracellular survival and proliferation in evolutionarily distant hosts.",2011,"Yousef Abu Kwaik, Christine Akimana"
Effect of 3' flanking neighbors on kinetics of pairing of dCTP or dTTP opposite O6-methylguanine in a defined primed oligonucleotide when Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I is used,2682644,10.1073/pnas.86.21.8271,"O6-Methylguanine (m6G) was incorporated site-specifically into two 25-base oligonucleotides differing only in the nucleotide on the 3' side of the modified base. Templates were primed with oligonucleotides terminating one or two bases prior to the site at which incorporation kinetics were to be investigated. Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I (Klenow fragment) was used to determine the apparent Km and relative Vmax of incorporation of either dCTP or dTTP opposite m6G or G. These data were used to calculate the relative frequency of incorporation opposite the m6G or the unmodified G. When the sequence was 3'-Cm6G-5', there was a 6- to 7-fold preference for formation of a m6G.T pair compared with m6G.C. The m6G.T frequency, based on Vmax/Km, was at least 50-fold greater than that of a G.T pair at the same site. Changing the sequence to 3'-Tm6G-5' had a marked effect on both Km and Vmax of pairs containing m6G and on the incorporation frequency of T opposite m6G, which was then only slightly favored over m6G.C. When replication was started directly opposite m6G, the kinetics appeared unaffected. These data indicate that the frequency of incorporation of C or T opposite m6G in a DNA template is dependent on the flanking neighbors and that a change of even a single base at the 3' position can have a major effect on mutagenic efficiency. Replication using Drosophila Pol alpha gave the same values for relative frequencies. Pairing of either C or T with m6G on the primer terminus did not significantly inhibit extension of the next normal base pair, in contrast to terminal mismatches of unmodified bases. It is concluded that, in the absence of repair, m6G can exhibit widely differing mutation frequencies which, in these experiments, can be as high as 85% of the replicated base. This variation in frequency of changed pairing could contribute to the occurrence of mutational ""'hot spots"" after replication of damaged DNA.",1989,"J M Essigmann, B Singer, F Chavez, M K Dosanjh, M F Goodman"
Isolation and characterization of gap junctions from Drosophila melanogaster,2496933,10.1007/BF00224713,"A procedure has been developed to isolate gap junction-enriched subcellular fractions from Drosophila. Crude membranes from larval homogenates were extracted with 1% N-lauroyl sarcosine in 6 M urea and the gap junctions were collected by centrifugation.

Electron microscopy revealed structurally pleiomorphic gap junctions in the fractions which included (1) conventional, 16-18 nm-wide septalaminar, (2) collapsed, 13-15 nm-wide pentalaminar, (3) split, and (4) aggregated forms. The fractions contained five major proteins with apparent molecular weights of 18, 26, 36, 52 and 54 kD.

Special attention was focused on the distribution of variation relative to the geographically variable polymorphism for two electrophoretic variants. Nucleotide heterozygosity as determined by eight six-cutter restriction enzymes for the 13-kb region is estimated, on the basis of the worldwide sample, to be 0.065%, which is the lowest value reported for any comparable region in the D. melanogaster genome. Significant linkage disequilibrium between electrophoretic alleles and restriction-site variation is observed for several sites.

Altered synaptic transmission in Drosophila hyperkinetic mutants,2553904,10.3109/01677068909066209,"Synaptic transmission in Drosophila can be altered by mutations in specific genes. For example, mutations in the Shaker (Sh) gene, which encodes the rapidly inactivating A-type potassium channel, cause repetitive nerve firing and prolonged transmitter release at the neuromuscular junction. Here we show that mutations in the Hyperkinetic (Hk) gene also affect the properties of synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction. In particular, we find that whereas single or low frequency nerve stimulation evokes a wild type postsynaptic response, at higher frequencies of nerve stimulation, each stimulus results in repetitive nerve firing and increased postsynaptic response, which is similar to that observed in Sh mutants. Various experiments suggest that this increased postsynaptic response results from prolonged depolarization of the nerve terminal, leading to increased transmitter release at the neuromuscular junction. The similarity in phenotypes between Sh and Hk mutants, along with the observation that Sh is epistatic to Hk in its effects on synaptic transmission, suggest that Hk acts on synaptic transmission by an effect on A-type potassium channels.",1989,"B Ganetzky, M Stern"
Ultrastructure of the ocellar visual system in normal and mutant Drosophila melanogaster,2500507,10.3109/01677068909066203,"Between the two compound eyes on the vertex on the adult head are the three simple eyes, ocelli. Transmission and scanning electron microscopy were used to investigate the corneal lenses, ocellar photoreceptors, and axonal projections in normal and mutant Drosophila melanogaster. In wild type flies, the cornea consists of about 45 lamellae. It has corneal nipples distally and is underlaid with a monolayer of corneagenous cells. Retinula cells have open rhabdomeres of about 2 microns (diameter) x 7 microns (length). Rhabdomeres extend to the distal extent of the cell and do not have caps. Microvilli have a rodlet within. Retinula cells are joined by belt desmosomes on the lateral borders. Eye color pigment granules are housed within the retinula cells of normal flies, not in accessory cells. The granules do not migrate in response to light. No screening pigment granules exist in the white mutant. Each ocellus has about 80 retinula cells whose axons project to corresponding ganglia from which 4 giant afferent interneurons (per ganglion) project to the brain. receptor terminals are invested with capitate projections from glia. Receptors synapse onto dyads of follower cells, usually interneuron processes, at sites of T shaped presynaptic ribbons. These ""T bars"" are surrounded by indistinct flattened vesicles. Interneurons make feed back synapses onto receptor terminals at T bars clustered with distinct round vesicles. Three mutants with abnormal ocelli were investigated. The none mutant has unusual compound eye and ocellar corneas. The compound eye is devoid of differentiated photoreceptors but some axons from undifferentiated cells from synapses. No receptors were found in the ocelli of none. The oc mutant has no ocelli, although sometimes an ocellar cornea like that of none is seen; the compound eye is normal. The rdo mutant is also specific to ocelli with smaller ocelli having half the wild type allotment of receptor cells; the number of giant afferents is unaffected. Mutants best known for their compound eye defects were examined. The norpA mutant loses its ocellar rhabdomeres with age but has normal feed forward and feed back synapses. This normal synaptology prevails despite the electrophysiological defects in norpA ocelli reported earlier. The rdgABS12 mutant has poorly formed ocellar receptors which show some degeneration with age but synapses survive.

The second region is localized near the 3'-LTR and consists of tandem 14-nucleotide repeats and a palindrome, destruction of which leads to weaker binding. There is no competition between the two regions for proteins, which evidence that they are recognized by the different proteins.

Statistical method for testing the neutral mutation hypothesis by DNA polymorphism,2513255,,"The relationship between the two estimates of genetic variation at the DNA level, namely the number of segregating sites and the average number of nucleotide differences estimated from pairwise comparison, is investigated. It is found that the correlation between these two estimates is large when the sample size is small, and decreases slowly as the sample size increases. Using the relationship obtained, a statistical method for testing the neutral mutation hypothesis is developed. This method needs only the data of DNA polymorphism, namely the genetic variation within population at the DNA level. A simple method of computer simulation, that was used in order to obtain the distribution of a new statistic developed, is also presented. Applying this statistical method to the five regions of DNA sequences in Drosophila melanogaster, it is found that large insertion/deletion (greater than 100 bp) is deleterious. It is suggested that the natural selection against large insertion/deletion is so weak that a large amount of variation is maintained in a population.",1989,F Tajima
Gene expression in adult metafemales of Drosophila melanogaster,2503426,,"The expression of selected X-linked and autosomal genes was examined in metafemales (3X:2A) compared to diploid sisters. Three enzyme activities (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, beta-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase) encoded by X-linked genes are not significantly different in the two classes of flies. In contrast, three autosomally encoded enzyme activities (alcohol dehydrogenase, alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase) are reduced in metafemales. Protein and DNA comparisons between metafemales and diploid sisters show a lowered level of total protein whereas the total DNA measurements are similar. Thus, the total cell number in metafemales is basically unchanged but gene expression is reduced. Phenotypic analysis of three autosomal loci, glass (gl), purple (pr) and pink-peach (pp), show that all three have lowered expression in metafemales while the X-linked loci, white-apricot (wa) and Bar (B), are dosage compensated. Quantitative dot blot analysis of messenger RNA levels of the second chromosomal locus, alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh), and the X chromosomal locus, rudimentary (r), show that Adh has reduced expression and r is partially compensated per total RNA in metafemales. It is proposed that the increased dosage of the X chromosome inversely affects both the X and autosomal gene expression but the simultaneous increased dosage of the structural genes on the X results in dosage compensation. The reduced levels of expression of autosomal genes could contribute to the great inviability of metafemales.",1989,"J C Hiebert, J A Birchler, M Krietzman"

In vitro, biochemical studies indicate that this reagent acts by being incorporated into DNA. To elucidate the mechanism of N4-aminocytidine mutagenesis, it is essential to identify the nature of DNA sequence alterations taking place during the mutagenesis. We have analyzed the nucleotide sequence changes in the lac promoter-lacZ alpha region of M13mp2 phage induced by treatment of phage-infected Escherichia coli with N4-aminocytidine. The sequence alterations of DNA samples from 89 mutants of the phage were determined. These mutants had single point mutations, except one mutant, in which a double point mutation was detected. Several hot spots were found: however, there are no apparent relations to particular DNA sequences regarding the locations of these spots. All the mutations are transitions; neither transversions nor deletions/insertions were found. A feature in these transitions is that the A/T to G/C and G/C to A/T changes occur at approximately equal rates. The overall picture of the mutagenesis is consistent with a scheme in which misincorporation and misreplication caused by the modified cytosine structure are the key steps in the DNA replication leading to transitions. Similar nucleotide alterations were found for the mutagenesis induced by an alkylated derivative, N'-methyl-N4-aminocytidine. N4-Aminocytidine also induced reversions of these mutants; both A/T to G/C and G/C to A/T transitions again took place.",1989,"H Hayatsu, A Nomura, K Matsumoto, K Negishi, T Bessho"

An RNA polymerase III-defective mutation in TATA-binding protein disrupts its interaction with a transcription factor IIIB subunit in drosophila cells,9218440,10.1074/jbc.272.29.18087,"A subunit of the Drosophila RNA polymerase III transcription factor IIIB (TFIIIB) complex has been identified using antibodies directed against the analogous human protein, hIIIB90. This protein has an apparent molecular mass of 105 kDa and has been designated dTAFIII105. Drosophila S-2 cell extracts that were immunodepleted of dTAFIII105 were substantially reduced in their capacity to support tRNA gene transcription. A protein (far Western) blot analysis revealed that dTAFIII105, present in a TFIIIB fraction, directly interacts with TATA-binding protein (TBP). Coimmunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that this protein associates with TBP in S-2 cell extracts. Our previous studies have identified a mutation at position 332 within Drosophila TBP that changes a highly conserved arginine residue to a histidine residue, which renders it specifically defective in its ability to support RNA polymerase III transcription in S-2 cells (Trivedi, A., Vilalta, A., Gopalan, S., and Johnson, D. L. (1996) Mol. Cell. Biol. 16, 6909-6916). We further demonstrate that extracts prepared from a stable cell line expressing epitope-tagged wild-type TBP exhibit an increase in tRNA gene transcription, whereas extracts derived from cells expressing the mutant TBP protein do not. Coimmunoprecipitation assays and far Western blot analysis demonstrate that this mutation in TBP abolishes its ability to stably interact with dTAFIII105. Thus, we have identified both a Drosophila protein that is directly associated with TBP in the TFIIIB complex, dTAFIII105, and an amino acid residue within the highly conserved carboxyl-terminal region of TBP that is critical for dTAFIII105-TBP interactions.",1997,"A Vilalta, D L Johnson, Z Wang, R G Roeder, A Trivedi"

The central 579-amino acid segment of the molecule contains one short motif homologous to sequences in a number of actin bundling proteins and a second motif present at the calmodulin binding sites of several proteins. Immunofluorescence studies show that the wild-type Asp protein is localized to the polar regions of the spindle immediately surrounding the centrosome. These findings are discussed in relation to the known spindle abnormalities in asp mutants.",1997,"T Howard, R D Saunders, D M Glover, C Gonzalez, M C Avides"
"Expression of the helix-loop-helix factor, Hes3, during embryo development suggests a role in early midbrain-hindbrain patterning",9152013,10.1016/s0925-4773(97)00665-5,"The Hes gene family members are mammalian homologues of the Drosophila hairy and Enhancer of split genes. hairy and Enhancer of split function in both segmentation and in the Notch neurogenic pathway during Drosophila embryo development. Previous expression data suggested a conserved role for the Hes genes in the Notch signalling pathway, but not in segmentation. Here, Hes3 expression during mouse embryogenesis is described. During early development of the central nervous system, Hes3 is expressed specifically in the region of the midbrain/hindbrain boundary, and in rhombomeres 2, 4, 6 and 7. This pattern suggests that Hes3 may have a conserved role as a segmentation gene. Later in development, Hes3 is co-expressed with other neurogenic gene homologues in the developing central nervous system and epithelial cells undergoing mesenchyme induction.",1997,C G Lobe
"Structural, functional, and protein binding analyses of bovine papillomavirus type 1 exonic splicing enhancers",9371566,10.1128/JVI.71.12.9096-9107.1997,"Alternative splicing plays an important role in regulation of bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV-1) gene expression. We have recently identified in BPV-1 late pre-mRNAs two purine-rich exonic splicing enhancers (SE1 and SE2) which also stimulate splicing of a Drosophila doublesex (dsx) pre-mRNA containing a suboptimal 3' splice site. In vivo studies now demonstrate that both SE1 and SE2 are required for preferential use of the BPV-1 nucleotide (nt) 3225 3' splice site in nonpermissive cells. Deletion or mutation of either element in a BPV-1 late pre-mRNA switches splicing to the late-specific alternative 3' splice site at nt 3605. To investigate the sequence specificity of these exonic splicing enhancers, various mutant SE1 or SE2 elements were connected to dsx pre-mRNAs and tested for their stimulatory effects on dsx pre-mRNA splicing in vitro. Substitution of U residues for either A or G residues in and around potential ASF/SF2 binding sites in SE1 or SE2 resulted in a significant reduction of splicing enhancer activity. However, the G-to-U substitutions in both enhancers had the largest effect, reducing splicing to near control levels. Further in vitro analyses showed that splicing enhancement by SE2 could be competed with excess unlabeled SE2 RNA, indicating that SE2 activity in HeLa nuclear extracts is mediated by trans-acting factors. UV cross-linking plus immunoprecipitation assays showed that both wild-type SE1 and SE2 RNAs could bind directly to purified HeLa SR proteins SRp30a (ASF/SF2), SRp55, and SRp75. UV cross-linking experiments also identified a 23-kDa protein which binds to SE2 but not SE1. This protein is present in both HeLa nuclear extracts and S100 extracts but absent from SR protein preparations, suggesting that it is not a classical SR protein. Mutant SE elements (containing G- to U-mutations) which had minimal splicing enhancer activity also had very weak binding capacity for these proteins, strongly suggesting that the binding of these proteins is required for splicing enhancer function.",1997,"Z M Zheng, C C Baker, P J He"
"A mutation in the XPB/ERCC3 DNA repair transcription gene, associated with trichothiodystrophy",9012405,,"Trichothiodystrophy (TTD) is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder characterized by sulfur-deficient brittle hair and nails, mental retardation, impaired sexual development, and ichthyosis. Photosensitivity has been reported in approximately 50% of the cases, but no skin cancer is associated with TTD. Virtually all photosensitive TTD patients have a deficiency in the nucleotide excision repair (NER) of UV-induced DNA damage that is indistinguishable from that of xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) complementation group D (XP-D) patients. DNA repair defects in XP-D are associated with two additional, quite different diseases; XP, a sun-sensitive and cancer-prone repair disorder, and Cockayne syndrome (CS), a photosensitive condition characterized by physical and mental retardation and wizened facial appearance. One photosensitive TTD case constitutes a new repair-deficient complementation group, TTD-A. Remarkably, both TTD-A and XP-D defects are associated with subunits of TFIIH, a basal transcription factor with a second function in DNA repair. Thus, mutations in TFIIH components may, on top of a repair defect, also cause transcriptional insufficiency, which may explain part of the non-XP clinical features of TTD. Besides XPD and TTDA, the XPB gene product is also part of TFIIH. To date, three patients with the remarkable conjunction of XP and CS but not TTD have been assigned to XP complementation group B (XP-B). Here we present the characterization of the NER defect in two mild TTD patients (TTD6VI and TTD4VI) and confirm the assignment to X-PB. The causative mutation was found to be a single base substitution resulting in a missense mutation (T119P) in a region of the XPB protein completely conserved in yeast, Drosophila, mouse, and man. These findings define a third TTD complementation group, extend the clinical heterogeneity associated with XP-B, stress the exclusive relationship between TTD and mutations in subunits of repair/transcription factor TFIIH, and strongly support the concept of ""transcription syndromes.""",1997,"O Chevallier-Lagente, I Donker, J H Hoeijmakers, E Eveno, G Weeda, W Vermeulen, A Stary, A Sarasin, M Mezzina, A Taïeb"
About the origin of retroviruses and the co-evolution of the gypsy retrovirus with the Drosophila flamenco host gene,9440256,,"The gypsy element of Drosophila melanogaster is the first retrovirus identified so far in invertebrates. According to phylogenetic data, gypsy belongs to the same group as the Ty3 class of LTR-retrotransposons, which suggests that retroviruses evolved from this kind of retroelements before the radiation of vertebrates. There are other invertebrate retroelements that are also likely to be endogenous retroviruses because they share with gypsy some structural and functional retroviral-like characteristics. Gypsy is controlled by a Drosophila gene called flamenco, the restrictive alleles of which maintain the retrovirus in a repressed state. In permissive strains, functional gypsy elements transpose at high frequency and produce infective particles. Defective gypsy proviruses located in pericentromeric heterochromatin of all strains seem to be very old components of the genome of Drosophila melanogaster, which indicates that gypsy invaded this species, or an ancestor, a long time ago. At that time, Drosophila melanogaster presumably contained permissive alleles of the flamenco gene. One can imagine that the species survived to the increase of genetic load caused by the retroviral invasion because restrictive alleles of flamenco were selected. The characterization of a retrovirus in Drosophila, one of the most advanced model organisms for molecular genetics, provides us with an exceptional clue to study how a species can resist a retroviral invasion.",1997,"F Chalvet, L Teysset, N Prud'homme, C Terzian, A Bucheton, A Pélisson, A Kim"

Peptide sequence information derived from the two subunits was used to isolate the corresponding cDNA clones, revealing that dTFIIE and human TFIIE share extensive amino acid similarity. Functional conservation was demonstrated by the ability of bacterially expressed dTFIIE to substitute for human TFIIE in an in vitro transcription assay reconstituted from purified components.

Presenilin 1 interaction in the brain with a novel member of the Armadillo family,9172160,10.1097/00001756-199704140-00033,"One approach to understanding the function of presenilin 1 (PS1), is to discover those proteins with which it interacts. Evidence for a function in developmental patterning came from C. elegans, in which a PS homologue was identified by screening for suppressors of a mutation in Notch/lin-12, a gene which specifies cell fate. However, this genetic experiment cannot determine which proteins directly interact with PS1. Therefore, we utilized the two hybrid system and confirmatory co-immunoprecipitations to identify a novel catenin, termed gamma-catenin, which interacts with PS1 and is principally expressed in brain. The catenins are a gene family related to the Armadillo gene in Drosophila, some of which appear to have dual roles-they are components of cell-cell adherens junctions, and may serve as intermediates in the Wingless (Wg) signaling pathway, which, like Notch/lin-12, is also responsible for a variety of inductive signaling events. In the non-neuronal 293 cell line, PS1 interacted with gamma-catenin, the family member with the greatest homology to Armadillo. Wg and Notch interactions are mediated by the Disheveled gene, which may form a signaling complex with PS1 and Wg pathway intermediates to regulate the function of the Notch/lin-12 gene.",1997,"M Lovett, J Zhou, M Medina, A D Simmons, U Liyanage, K S Kosik, C Ho"
Targeted neuronal ablation: the role of pioneer neurons in guidance and fasciculation in the CNS of Drosophila,9310320,,"Although pioneer neurons are the first to delineate the axon pathways, it is uncertain whether they have unique pathfinding abilities. As a first step in defining the role of pioneer neurons in the Drosophila embryonic CNS, we describe the temporal profile and trajectory of the axons of four pioneer neurons and show that they differ from previously published reports. We show, by targeted ablation of one, two, three or four pioneer neurons at a time, that (1) no single pioneer neuron is essential for axon tract formation, (2) the interaction between two pioneers is necessary for the establishment of each fascicle and (3) pioneer neurons function synergistically to establish the longitudinal axon tracts, to guide the fasciculation of follower neurons along specific fascicles and to prevent axons from crossing the midline.",1997,"A Hidalgo, A H Brand"
PARP cleavage in the apoptotic pathway in S2 cells from Drosophila melanogaster,9493967,,"Caspase activities and two cDNA sequences have been identified in Drosophila melanogaster. To study the molecular events following the activation of the apoptotic pathway in D. melanogaster, S2 cells were treated with etoposide and the timing of the apoptotic events, such as caspase activation, mitochondrial pore opening, and loss of membrane asymmetry, was determined. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) is known to be cleaved in the early phase of apoptosis in vertebrate systems. Little is known about the involvement of PARP cleavage in apoptosis in invertebrates. If PARP inactivation is a general event, this could mean that DNA repair enzymes need to be cleaved for the death pathway to be completed. We have found that in etoposide-treated cells, PARP protein is processed, but the nature of the cleavage is not known. Further experiments must be conducted and the peptide fragments must be sequenced to relate protease activities with PARP cleavage.",1997,"K Uchida, S Hanai, P Poltronieri, M Miwa, Y Koyama, T Yokota"
"UbcD1, a Drosophila ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme required for proper telomere behavior",9106658,10.1101/gad.11.7.863,"The end-to-end association of chromosomes through their telomeres has been observed in normal cells of certain organisms, as well as in senescent and tumor cells. The molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are currently unknown. We show here that five independent mutant alleles in the Drosophila UbcD1 gene cause frequent telomere-telomere attachments during both mitosis and male meiosis that are not seen in wild type. These telomeric associations involve all the telomeres of the D. melanogaster chromosome complement, albeit with different frequencies. The pattern of telomeric associations observed in UbcD1 mutants suggests strongly that the interphase chromosomes of wild-type larval brain cells maintain a Rab1 orientation within the nucleus, with the telomeres and centromeres segregated to opposite sides of the nucleus. The UbcD1 gene encodes a class I ubiquitin-conjugating (E2) enzyme. This indicates that ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis is normally needed to ensure proper telomere behavior during Drosophila cell division. We therefore suggest that at least one of the targets of UbcD1 ubiquitination is a telomere-associated polypeptide that may help maintain proper chromosomal orientation during interphase.",1997,"R B Rawson, M Gatti, G Belloni, S A Wasserman, M Tudor, R Petrucci, M L Goldberg, G Cenci, D H Castrillon"
Activation of distinct caspase-like proteases by Fas and reaper in Drosophila cells,9342343,10.1073/pnas.94.22.11951,"The cytoplasmic region of Fas, a mammalian death factor receptor, shares a limited homology with reaper, an apoptosis-inducing protein in Drosophila. Expression of either the Fas cytoplasmic region (FasC) or of reaper in Drosophila cells caused cell death. The death process induced by FasC or reaper was inhibited by crmA or p35, suggesting that its death process is mediated by caspase-like proteases. Both Ac-YVAD aldehyde and Ac-DEVD aldehyde, specific inhibitors of caspase 1- and caspase 3-like proteases, respectively, inhibited the FasC-induced death of Drosophila cells. However, the cell death induced by reaper was inhibited by Ac-DEVD aldehyde, but not by Ac-YVAD aldehyde. A caspase 1-like protease activity that preferentially recognizes the YVAD sequence gradually increased in the cytosolic fraction of the FasC-activated cells, whereas the caspase 3-like protease activity recognizing the DEVD sequence was observed in the reaper-activated cells. Partial purification and biochemical characterization of the proteases indicated that there are at least three distinct caspase-like proteases in Drosophila cells, which are differentially activated by FasC and reaper. The conservation of the Fas-death signaling pathway in Drosophila cells, which is distinct from that for reaper, may indicate that cell death in Drosophila is controlled not only by the reaper suicide gene, but also by a Fas-like killer gene.",1997,"T Kondo, T Yokokura, S Nagata"
Characterization of an ADP-ribosylation factor-like 1 protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae,9388248,10.1074/jbc.272.49.30998,"ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs) are highly conserved approximately 20-kDa guanine nucleotide-binding proteins that enhance the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of cholera toxin and are believed to participate in vesicular transport in both exocytic and endocytic pathways. Several ARF-like proteins (ARLs) have been cloned from Drosophila, rat, and human; however, the biological functions of ARLs are unknown. We have identified a yeast gene (ARL1) encoding a protein that is structurally related (>60% identical) to human, rat, and Drosophila ARL1. Biochemical analyses of purified recombinant yeast ARL1 (yARL1) protein revealed properties similar to those ARF and ARL1 proteins, including the ability to bind and hydrolyze GTP. Like other ARLs, recombinant yARL1 protein did not stimulate cholera toxin-catalyzed auto-ADP-ribosylation. yARL1 was not recognized by antibodies against mammalian ARLs or yeast ARFs. Anti-yARL1 antibodies did not cross-react with yeast ARFs, but did react with human ARLs. On subcellular fractionation, yARL1, similar to yARF1, was localized to the soluble fraction. The amino terminus of yARL1, like that of ARF, was myristoylated. Unlike Drosophila Arl1, yeast ARL1 was not essential for cell viability. Like rat ARL1, yARL1 might be associated in part with the Golgi complex. However, yARL1 was not required for endoplasmic reticulum-to-Golgi protein transport, and it may offer an opportunity to define an ARL function in another kind of vesicular trafficking, such as the regulated secretory pathway.",1997,"C Y Lin, M C Huang, F J Lee, W L Yu, L M Buu, J Moss, M Vaughan, C F Huang"
Properties of single Drosophila Trpl channels expressed in Sf9 insect cells,9038807,10.1152/ajpcell.1997.272.1.C27,"The transient receptor potential (trp)-like (trpl) gene is thought to encode an ion channel important for signal transduction in Drosophila photoreceptor cells. Consistent with this hypothesis, heterologous expression of the trpl-encoded protein (Trpl) is associated with the appearance of an outwardly rectifying, nonselective cation current. In the present study, single channels were recorded in cell-attached, inside-out, and outside-out membrane patches from Sf9 insect cells infected with recombinant baculovirus-containing trpl cDNA under control of the polyhedrin promoter. The single-channel current-voltage relationship was linear from -100 to +80 mV with a slope conductance of 89-110 pS. The probability of opening was voltage sensitive, increasing at positive potentials contributing to the outwardly rectifying properties of the whole cell currents. The single channels 1) were never observed in Sf9 cells infected with recombinant baculovirus containing the B2 bradykinin receptor cDNA or in noninfected Sf9 cells; 2) appear at the same time postinfection as the Trpl whole cell current; 3) were nonselective with respect to Na+, Ca2+, and Ba2+; 4) were blocked by 1-2 mM La3+ and Gd3+ (but not 10 microM); and 5) were blocked by 4-8 mM Mg2+. The single Trpl channel activity increased spontaneously with time after patch formation, and the activity was further increased by application of bradykinin to cells expressing both the B2 bradykinin receptor and the Trpl protein. These results suggest that this single-channel activity reflects expression of the Trpl protein and provides conclusive evidence that trpl encodes a nonselective cation channel consistent with its proposed role in Drosophila phototransduction.",1997,"W G Sinkins, D L Kunze, L Vaca, W P Schilling"

Two wild type strains, one homozygous for Adh(F) and one for Adh(S) from Chunan, Korea were used. The ADH activity and CRMs of the Adh(F) strain were 2.1 times higher than those of Adhs strain, and ADH activity was higher with isopropanol (secondary alcohol) than with ethanol (primary alcohol) as a substrate in both Adh(F) and Adh(S) strains. When the larvae, pupae, newly emerged adults (0-1 day), and adults (5-7 days) of Drosophila melanogaster Adh(F) and Adh(S) strains were fed on a defined low yeast and threonine medium, ADH activity and ADH CRM levels were increased. Northern blot analyses indicated that the production of mRNA of the larvae, young adults (0-1 day), and adults (5-7 days) was increased by dietary threonine. ADH activity and ADH CRM increases in Drosophila melanogaster fed on threonine were as a result of threonine-stimulated alteration in the amount of ADH mRNA. The elevated level of the ADH mRNA transcribed from the proximal and distal promoters of threonine-fed larvae and adults showed that there was an induction.",1997,"K S Park, K S Kim, S J Kang"
Requirement for dynamin during Notch signaling in Drosophila neurogenesis,9441691,10.1006/dbio.1997.8723,"Singling out of a unique neural precursor from a group of equivalent cells, during Drosophila neurogenesis, involves Notch-mediated lateral signaling. During this process, activation of the Notch signaling pathway leads to repression of neural development. Disruption of this signaling pathway results in the development of an excess of neural cells. The loss of activity of dynamin, which is encoded by the gene shibire and is required for endocytosis, results in a similar phenotype. Here we have investigated the requirement of shibire function for Notch signaling during the segregation of sensory bristles on the notum of the fly. Overexpression of different constitutively active forms of Notch in shibire mutant flies indicates that shibire function is not necessary for transduction of the signal downstream of Notch, even when the receptor is integrated in the plasma membrane. However, when wild-type Notch is activated by its ligand Delta, dynamin is required in both signaling and receiving cells for normal singling out of precursors. This suggests an active role of the signaling cell for ligand-mediated receptor endocytosis in the case of transmembrane ligands. We discuss the possible implications of these results for normal functioning of Notch-mediated lateral signaling.",1997,"M Haenlin, L Seugnet, P Simpson"

As revealed by RNA blot-hybridization analysis, two mRNA species of 2.3 and 3.2 kb are detected in the central nervous system of Lymnaea.

The dominant mutation Suppressor of black indicates that de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis is involved in the Drosophila tan pigmentation pathway,7902526,10.1007/BF00284686,"A deficiency in the production of beta-alanine causes the black (b) phenotype of Drosophila melanogaster. This phenotype is normalized by a semi-dominant mutant gene Su(b) shown previously to be located adjacent to or within the rudimentary (r) locus. The r gene codes for three enzyme activities involved in de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis. Pyrimidines are known to give rise to beta-alanine. However, until recently it has been unclear whether de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis is directly coupled to beta-alanine synthesis during the tanning process. In this report we show that flies carrying Su(b) can exhibit an additional phenotype, resistance to toxic pyrimidine analogs (5-fluorouracil, 6-azathymine and 6-azauracil). Our interpretation of this observation is that the pyrimidine pool is elevated in the mutant flies. However, enzyme assays indicate that r enzyme activities are not increased in Su(b) flies. Genetic mapping of the Su(b) gene now places the mutation within the r gene, possibly in the carbamyl phosphate synthetase (CPSase) domain. The kinetics of CPSase activity in crude extracts has been studied in the presence of uridine triphosphate (UTP). While CPSase from wild-type flies was strongly inhibited by the end-product, UTP, CPSase from Su(b) was inhibited to a lesser extent. We propose that diminished end-product inhibition of de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis in Su(b) flies increases available pyrimidine and consequently the beta-alanine pool.

All constructs used attenuated the neurogenic phenotype associated with this deletion. However, constructs encoding proteins with truncated carboxy-termini exibited in all cases a higher activity than constructs encoding the full length version of the protein. Neutralization of the basic domain severely reduced, but did not completely abolish the rescuing activity of E(spl), while proteins in which a proline residue within the basic domain had been changed to either threonine or asparagine were slightly less efficient in their rescuing activity than the corresponding wild-type versions.

The genetic analysis of achiasmate segregation in Drosophila melanogaster. III. The wild-type product of the Axs gene is required for the meiotic segregation of achiasmate homologs,8349113,,"The regular segregation of achiasmate chromosomes in Drosophila melanogaster females is ensured by two distinct segregational systems. The segregation of achiasmate homologs is assured by the maintenance of heterochromatic pairing; while the segregation of heterologous chromosomes is ensured by a separate mechanism that may not require physical association. AxsD (Aberrant X segregation) is a dominant mutation that specifically impairs the segregation of achiasmate homologs; heterologous achiasmate segregations are not affected. As a result, achiasmate homologs frequently participate in heterologous segregations at meiosis I. We report the isolation of two intragenic revertants of the AxsD mutation (Axsr2 and Axsr3) that exhibit a recessive meiotic phenotype identical to that observed in AxsD/AxsD females. A third revertant (Axsr1) exhibits no meiotic phenotype as a homozygote, but a meiotic defect is observed in Axsr1/Axsr2 females. Therefore mutations at the AxsD locus define a gene necessary and specific for homologous achiasmate segregation during meiosis. We also characterize the interactions of mutations at the Axs locus with two other meiotic mutations (ald and ncd). Finally, we propose a model in which Axs+ is required for the normal separation of paired achiasmate homologs. In the absence of Axs+ function, the homologs are often unable to separate from each other and behave as a single segregational unit that is free to segregate from heterologous chromosomes.",1993,"R L French, D R Falk, T Arbel, W L Whyte, G Yasuda, R S Hawley, H Irick"
Mechanism of DmS-II-mediated pause suppression by Drosophila RNA polymerase II,7689559,,"Transcription elongation factor S-II mediates nascent transcript cleavage by RNA polymerase II (Reines, D. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 3795-3800). We have examined the mechanism of action of the Drosophila S-II analog, DmS-II, in a defined transcription system. Our results show that DmS-II is necessary and sufficient to activate nascent transcript cleavage by RNA polymerase II during transcription of a dC-tailed template. The pattern of transcripts resulting from prolonged action by DmS-II indicates that there are kinetic barriers to transcript shortening. During the cleavage reaction, the polymerase remains in register with the template strand and generates mainly nucleotide dimers. The ability of DmS-II to mediate transcript shortening resides in the carboxyl-terminal half of the protein. Our results support a model for pause suppression in which DmS-II binds to the paused polymerase, causes one cleavage event and is then released from the complex. Elongation by the polymerase then allows a second encounter with the pause site and a second chance of passing the site. Complete pause suppression may require multiple transcript shortening events for some polymerase molecules.",1993,"H Guo, D H Price"
Genes controlling cellular polarity in Drosophila,8049482,,"The control of cellular polarity is one of the least understood aspects of development. Genes have been identified in Drosophila that affect the polarity of embryonic cells in all three axes, apical-basal, proximodistal and dorsoventral. Mutations that affect adult polarity are also known and mutant flies show several types of pattern alteration, including rotations and mirror-image duplications. Imaginal discs are much greater in size, however, than the embryo, and adult structures contain very large numbers of cells, many of which are not visibly differentiated with respect to their immediate neighbours. In regions where neighbouring cells are similar to each other, the imaginal polarity mutants alter the orientation of bristles and hairs, but do not change cellular fate. Other regions, such as the tarsal segments of the legs, the ommatidia of the eye and the bracketed bristle sockets on the tibia, behave as discrete fields. Within these fields, fine-scale mirror-image reversals and pattern duplications are observed, analogous to those caused by the embryonic segment polarity mutants. Thus, the polarised transmission of information can affect either orientation or fate depending on whether cells are differentiated from their immediate neighbours. Cellular polarity will be critically dependent on both the internal cytoskeletal architecture and the spatial organisation of signal transduction molecules within the cell membrane.",1993,D Gubb
Neurotrophic activity of the Antennapedia homeodomain depends on its specific DNA-binding properties,8105471,10.1073/pnas.90.19.9120,"In previous reports we have demonstrated that the 60-aa peptide corresponding to the homeodomain of the Drosophila protein Antennapedia (pAntp) translocates through the membrane of neurons in culture, accumulates in neuronal nuclei, and promotes neurite growth. To analyze the importance of specific pAntp DNA-binding properties in this phenomenon we have constructed three mutant versions of pAntp that differ in their ability to translocate through the membrane and to bind specifically the cognate sequence for homeodomains present in the promoter of HoxA5. We demonstrate that removing two hydrophobic residues of the third helix inhibits pAntp internalization and suppresses its neurotrophic activity. We also show that pAntp neurotrophic activity is lost when mutations are introduced in positions preserving its penetration and nuclear accumulation but abolishing its capacity to bind specifically the cognate DNA-binding motif for homeoproteins. Our results strongly suggest that pAntp neurotrophicity requires both its internalization and its specific binding to homeobox cognate sequences.

Disruption in S. pombe of the gene encoding the 44-kDa protein, for which we propose the name S. pombe rna1p, reveals that it is essential for growth. Our analysis of purified S. pombe rna1p represents the first biochemical characterization of an RNA1 gene product and reveals that it is a monomeric protein of globular shape. Cell fractionation and immunofluorescence microscopy indicate that rna1p is a cytoplasmic protein possibly enriched in the nuclear periphery. We identify a sequence motif of 29 residues, which is rich in leucine and repeated eight times both in S. pombe and in S. cerevisiae rna1p. Similar leucine-rich repeats present in a series of other proteins, e.g., the mammalian ribonuclease/angiogenin inhibitor, adenylyl cyclase from S. cerevisiae, the toll protein from Drosophila melanogaster, and the sds22 protein phosphatase regulatory subunit from S. pombe, are thought to be involved in protein-protein interactions. Thus rna1p may act as a scaffold protein possibly interacting in the nuclear periphery with a protein ligand that could be associated with exported RNA.",1993,"K Weber, V Gerke, F Melchior"
"Axis specification in the developing Drosophila appendage: the role of wingless, decapentaplegic, and the homeobox gene aristaless",8104704,10.1016/0092-8674(93)90732-6,"The wingless (wg) and decapentaplegic (dpp) genes of Drosophila encode homologs of secreted growth factors and are required for the correct patterning of the appendages. We show that the presumptive tips of both the leg and wing, the distal extreme of the proximodistal axis, are characterized by the close association of cells expressing wg, dpp, and the homeobox gene aristaless (al). Ectopic expression of wg can induce both ectopic al expression and a duplication of the proximodistal axis (the development of supernumerary legs), but only in regions expressing high levels of dpp. Ectopic al expression can induce a duplication of the proximodistal axis in the wing, suggesting that it may be directly involved in axis specification. The proximodistal axis may be specified via a mechanism involving a direct interaction between cells expressing wg, dpp, and possibly al.",1993,"A Tomlinson, G Campbell, T Weaver"
"The role of heterochromatin in the expression of a heterochromatic gene, the rolled locus of Drosophila melanogaster",8514136,,"Constitutive heterochromatic regions of chromosomes are those that remain condensed through most or all of the cell cycle. In Drosophila melanogaster, the constitutive heterochromatic regions, located around the centromere, contain a number of gene loci, but at a much lower density than euchromatin. In the autosomal heterochromatin, the gene loci appear to be unique sequence genes interspersed among blocks of highly repeated sequences. Euchromatic genes do not function well when brought into the vicinity of heterochromatin (position-effect variegation). We test the possibility that the blocks of centromeric heterochromatin provide an environment essential for heterochromatic gene function. To assay directly the functional requirement of autosomal heterochromatic genes to reside in heterochromatin, the rolled (rl) gene, which is normally located deep in chromosome 2R heterochromatin, was relocated within small blocks of heterochromatin to a variety of euchromatic positions by successive series of chromosomal rearrangements. The function of the rl gene is severely affected in rearrangements in which the rl gene is isolated in a small block of heterochromatin, and these position effects can be reverted by rearrangements which bring the rl gene closer to any large block of autosomal or X chromosome heterochromatin. There is some evidence that five other 2R heterochromatic genes are also affected among these rearrangements. These findings demonstrate that the heterochromatic genes, in contrast to euchromatic genes whose function is inhibited by relocation to heterochromatin, require proximity to heterochromatin to function properly, and they argue strongly that a major function of the highly repeated satellite DNA, which comprises most of the heterochromatin, is to provide this heterochromatic environment.",1993,"A J Hilliker, D F Eberl, B J Duyf"
The Drosophila melanogaster suppressor of Hairy-wing zinc finger protein has minimal effects on gene expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae,8243999,,"Many mutations in Drosophila melanogaster are gypsy retrotransposon insertions. Gypsy binds the protein (SUHW) encoded by the suppressor of Hairy-wing [su(Hw)] gene, and SUHW alters expression of surrounding genes. When gypsy is between an enhancer and promoter, SUHW blocks activation of transcription by the enhancer. Additionally, when gypsy is downstream of a promoter in a parallel orientation, SUHW increases truncation of transcripts at the poly(A) site in the gypsy 5' long terminal repeat, thereby decreasing the gene transcript levels. The effects of SUHW appear to involve fundamental and general mechanisms controlling gene expression because SUHW potentiates other poly(A) sites and blocks several enhancers in Drosophila. To investigate these mechanisms, SUHW was expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Although SUHW enters the nucleus and binds DNA in yeast, it has surprisingly minor effects on utilization of the CYC1 poly(A) site and transcription activation by a GAL upstream activation sequence. These observations indicate that the observed effects of SUHW on gene expression in Drosophila require specific interactions with other factors that are absent or unrecognizable in yeast.",1993,"J Kim, D Dorsett, B Shen"
Drosophila suzukii contains a peptide homologous to the Drosophila melanogaster sex-peptide and functional in both species,8353518,10.1016/0965-1748(93)90030-v,"A peptide homologous to the Drosophila melanogaster sex-peptide (SP) was isolated from Drosophila suzukii accessory glands and its amino acid sequence determined.

Comparison of the sequences reveals strong homologies in the N-terminal and C-terminal parts of the peptides. In the D. suzukii sex-peptide, however, five additional amino acids are inserted after amino acid 7. Based on the sequence of the peptide, a cDNA coding for the D. suzukii peptide was isolated by PCR. Sequence analysis of the cDNA confirmed the SP amino acid sequence determined by peptide sequencing. Furthermore, based on the cDNA sequence, we isolated the D. suzukii sex-peptide gene by inverse PCR. The D. suzukii sex-peptide gene contains an intron and codes for a 60 amino acid precursor.

CACT-Bgl protein contains the six ankyrin repeat sequences which are necessary for specific binding to the Drosophila rel family transcription factor dorsal. We show that the purified CACT-Bgl protein can bind specifically to dorsal and, using circular dichroism spectroscopy, that the protein adopts a largely alpha-helical secondary structure. A further analysis of the ankyrin repeat domains of cactus, using an improved secondary structure prediction program indicates that the N-terminal of the repeat will form into a loop structure and the C-terminal section into an interrupted, amphipathic alpha-helix. On the basis of these findings we propose that the ankyrin repeats of cactus fold together into helical bundles interconnected by diverged loops.",1993,"N J Gay, M Ntwasa"
Expression of a gene duplication encoding conserved sperm tail proteins is translationally regulated in Drosophila melanogaster,8441407,10.1128/mcb.13.3.1708,"We have analyzed a locus of Drosophila melanogaster located at 98C on chromosome 3, which contains two tandemly arranged genes, named Mst98Ca and Mst98Cb. They are two additional members of the Mst(3)CGP gene family by three criteria. (i) Both genes are exclusively transcribed in the male germ line. (ii) Both transcripts encode a protein with a high proportion of the repetitive motif Cys-Gly-Pro. (iii) Their expression is translationally controlled; while transcripts can be detected in diploid stages of spermatogenesis, association with polysomes can be shown only in haploid stages of sperm development. The genes differ markedly from the other members of the gene family in structure; they do not contain introns, they are of much larger size, and they have the Cys-Gly-Pro motifs clustered at the carboxy-terminal end of the encoded proteins. An antibody generated against the Mst98Ca protein recognizes both Mst98C proteins in D. melanogaster. In a male-sterile mutation in which spermiogenesis is blocked before individualization of sperm, both of these proteins are no longer synthesized. This finding provides proof of late translation for the Mst98C proteins and thereby independent proof of translational control of expression. Northern (RNA) and Western immunoblot analyses indicate the presence of homologous gene families in many other Drosophila species. The Mst98C proteins share sequence homology with proteins of the outer dense fibers in mammalian spermatozoa and can be localized to the sperm tail by immunofluorescence with an anti-Mst98Ca antibody.",1993,"M Schäfer, A Hülster, U Schäfer, D Börsch"
Modulation of the glycogen synthase kinase-3 family by tyrosine phosphorylation,8382613,,"Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) is a protein serine kinase implicated in the cellular response to insulin. The enzyme is the mammalian homologue of the zeste-white3 (shaggy) homeotic gene of Drosophila melanogaster and has been implicated in the regulation of the c-Jun/AP-1 transcription factor. In mammals this protein serine kinase is encoded by two related genes termed GSK-3 alpha and beta. Here, we demonstrate that these two proteins and the fruit fly protein are phosphorylated on tyrosine in vivo. Moreover, GSK-3 beta activity and function are shown to be dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation. The modified tyrosine residue is conserved in all members of the GSK-3 family and is equivalent to that required for activity by mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases. However, unlike MAP kinases, GSK-3 is highly phosphorylated on tyrosine and thus active in resting cells.",1993,"S E Plyte, N F Totty, J R Woodgett, K Hughes, E Nikolakaki"
Gap junctions in ovarian follicles of Drosophila melanogaster: inhibition and promotion of dye-coupling between oocyte and follicle cells,8364958,10.1007/BF00304623,"The analysis of chimeras has shown that communication between germ-line and soma cells plays an important role during Drosophila oogenesis. We have therefore investigated the intercellular exchange of the fluorescent tracer molecule, Lucifer yellow, pressure-injected into the oocyte of vitellogenic follicles of Drosophila. The dye reached the nurse cells via cytoplasmic bridges and entered, via gap junctions, the somatic follicle cells covering the oocyte. The percentage of follicles showing dye-coupling between oocyte and follicle cells was found to increase with the developmental stage up to stage 11, but depended also on the status of oogenesis, i.e., the stage-spectrum, in the respective ovary. During late stage 10B and stage 11, dye-coupling was restricted to the follicle cells covering the anterior pole of the oocyte. No dye-coupling was observed from stage 12 onwards. During prolonged incubation in vitro, the dye was found to move from the follicle cells back into the oocyte; this process was suppressable with dinitrophenol. Dye-coupling was inhibited when prolonged in vitro incubation preceded the dye-injection. Moreover, dye-coupling was inhibited with acidic pH, low [K+], high intracellular [Ca2+], octanol, dinitrophenol, and NaN3, but not with retinoic acid, basic pH, or high extracellular [Ca2+]. Dye-coupling was stimulated with a juvenile hormone analogue and with 20-hydroxyecdysone. Thus, gap junctions between oocyte and follicle cells may play an important role in intercellular communication during oogenesis. We discuss the significance of our findings with regard to the electrophysiological properties of the follicles, and to the coordinated activities of the different cell types during follicle development and during the establishment of polarity in the follicle.",1993,"J Bohrmann, A Haas-Assenbaum"
Definition of the DNA-binding site repertoire for the Drosophila transcription factor SNAIL,8371971,10.1093/nar/21.17.3951,"The Drosophila gene snail (sna) which encodes a zinc finger protein is essential for dorsal-ventral pattern formation in the developing embryo. We have defined a repertoire of SNAIL (SNA) binding sites using recombinant SNA proteins to select specific binding sequences from a pool of random sequence nucleotides. The bound sequences which were selected by multiple rounds of gel retardation and amplification by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were subsequently cloned and sequenced. The consensus sequence, 5'G/A A/t G/A A CAGGTG C/t A C 3', with a highly conserved core of 6 bases, CAGGTG, shares no significant homology with known binding sequences of other Drosophila zinc finger proteins. However, the CAGGTG core is identical to the core motif of aHLH (helix-loop-helix) binding sites. The strongest SNA binding is obtained with sequences containing this core motif whereas reduced binding is seen for sequences with canonical CANNTG HLH motifs. Interestingly, SNA binding is detected in the promoter region of the snail gene. Transient expression in co-transfection experiments using a SNA binding element (SBE) linked to a heterologous promoter indicates that SNA has the ability to function as a transcription activator.",1993,"Y Lutz, C Dennefeld, V Mauhin, A Alberga"
Characterization of the length polymorphism in the A + T-rich region of the Drosophila obscura group species,8483159,10.1007/BF00160476,"In the twelve Drosophila obscura group species studied, belonging to the affinis, obscura, and pseudoobscura subgroups, the mitochondrial DNA length ranges from 15.8 to 17.2 kb. This length polymorphism is mainly due to insertions/deletions in the variable region of the A + T-rich region. In addition, one species (D. tristis) possess a tandem duplication of a 470-bp fragment that contains the replication origin. The same duplication has occurred at least twice in the Drosophila evolutionary history due to the fact that the repetition is analogous to repetitions found in the four species of the D. melanogaster complex. By comparing the nucleotide sequence of the conserved region in D. ambigua, D. obscura, D. yakuba, D. teissieri, and D. virilis, we show the presence of a secondary structure, likely implied in the replication origin, which could favor the generation of this kind of duplications. Finally, we propose that the high A and T content in the variable region of the A + T-rich region favors the formation of less-stable secondary structures, which could explain the generation of minor insertion/deletions found in this region.",1993,"A Monforte, E Barrio, A Latorre"

Wings of the emerging adult flies were scored for the presence of spots of mutant cells which can result from either somatic mutation or mitotic recombination. The tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine, which is closely related to imipramine (previously shown to be genotoxic in somatic cells of Drosophila), was clearly genotoxic at concentrations above 10 mM.

The antidepressant maprotiline and the antipsychotic chlorpromazine, which are distinguished from the other compounds by a 6-membered central ring instead of a 7-membered one, were not genotoxic in the same dose range.

We find that Crb apical stabilisation requires the extracellular domain. In vivo results from Drosophila suggest that the extracellular domain assists Crb apical stabilisation by mediating Crb-Crb interactions at opposing cell membranes. We further confirm Crb-Crb extracellular interactions by showing that the extracellular domain of Crb is sufficient to promote cell aggregation in vitro. Furthermore, we report that Crb apical stabilisation mediated by the extracellular domain is also required for maintenance of Crb apicobasal polarity. Our results provide new insights into the mechanisms of apicobasal polarity and the cellular mechanisms of tissue architecture.",2013,"Bernard Moussian, Nicolás Martín, Marta Llimargas, Sara Ricardo, Annalisa Letizia"
The zinc finger transcription factor Jing is required for dendrite/axonal targeting in Drosophila antennal lobe development,23810656,10.1016/j.ydbio.2013.06.023,"An important role in olfactory system development is played by transcription factors which act in sensory neurons or in their interneuron targets as cell autonomous regulators of downstream effectors such as cell surface molecules and signalling systems that control neuronal identity and process guidance. Some of these transcriptional regulators have been characterized in detail in the development of the neural elements that innervate the antennal lobe in the olfactory system of Drosophila. Here we identify the zinc finger transcription factor Jing as a cell autonomously acting transcriptional regulator that is required both for dendrite targeting of projection neurons and local interneurons as well as for axonal targeting of olfactory sensory neurons in Drosophila olfactory system development. Immunocytochemical analysis shows that Jing is widely expressed in the neural cells during postembryonic development. MARCM-based clonal analysis of projection neuron and local interneuron lineages reveals a requirement for Jing in dendrite targeting; Jing loss-of-function results in loss of innervation in specific glomeruli, ectopic innervation of inappropriate glomeruli, aberrant profuse dendrite arborisation throughout the antennal lobe, as well as mistargeting to other parts of the CNS. ey-FLP-based MARCM analysis of olfactory sensory neurons reveals an additional requirement for Jing in axonal targeting; mutational inactivation of Jing causes specific mistargeting of some olfactory sensory neuron axons to the DA1 glomerulus, reduction of targeting to other glomeruli, as well as aberrant stalling of axons in the antennal lobe. Taken together, these findings indicate that Jing acts as a key transcriptional control element in wiring of the circuitry in the developing olfactory sensory system in Drosophila.",2013,"Indu S Nair, Veronica Rodrigues, Heinrich Reichert, K VijayRaghavan"

These interactions are required for the deadenylation and decay of miRNA targets. Recent studies have indicated that miRNAs repress translation before inducing target deadenylation and decay; however, whether translational repression and deadenylation are coupled or represent independent repressive mechanisms is unclear. Another remaining question is whether translational repression also requires GW182 proteins to interact with both PABP and deadenylases. To address these questions, we characterized the interaction of Drosophila melanogaster GW182 with deadenylases and defined the minimal requirements for a functional GW182 protein.

Accelerated degradation of perS protein provides insight into light-mediated phase shifting,23735496,10.1177/0748730413489797,"Phase resetting by light is an important feature of circadian rhythms, and the current Drosophila model focuses on light-mediated degradation of the clock protein TIMELESS (TIM). PERIOD (PER) is the binding partner of TIM and a major repressor of the molecular clock, but direct evidence of PER in phase resetting is lacking. Because light sensitivity of the per(S) short period mutant strain is strongly enhanced compared with wild-type strains, we assayed the importance of PER degradation for light-induced phase shifting. The per(S) protein (PERS) is markedly less stable than wild-type PER, in tissue culture and in flies, and PERS as well as PER is stabilized by TIM in both systems. Consistent with this finding, light-induced TIM degradation appears to trigger PER degradation. Moreover, TIM degradation is similar in the clock neurons of both strains, suggesting that it is not strongly affected by PERS and does not dictate the difference in the light response. In contrast, there is a dramatic quantitative difference between PER and PERS degradation in these neurons, indicating that PER degradation dictates the enhanced amplitude of the light-induced phase response. The data indicate that TIM inhibits PER degradation and that PER degradation follows light-mediated TIM degradation within circadian neurons; PER degradation then dictates qualitative as well as quantitative features of light-mediated phase-resetting.",2013,"Yue Li, Michael Rosbash"
Tissue repair through cell competition and compensatory cellular hypertrophy in postmitotic epithelia,23685249,10.1016/j.devcel.2013.04.013,"In multicellular organisms, tissue integrity and organ size are maintained through removal of aberrant or damaged cells and compensatory proliferation. Little is known, however, about this homeostasis system in postmitotic tissues, where tissue-intrinsic genetic programs constrain cell division and new cells no longer arise from stem cells. Here we show that, in postmitotic Drosophila follicular epithelia, aberrant but viable cells are eliminated through cell competition, and the resulting loss of local tissue volume triggers sporadic cellular hypertrophy to repair the tissue. This ""compensatory cellular hypertrophy"" is implemented by acceleration of the endocycle, a variant cell cycle composed of DNA synthesis and gap phases without mitosis, dependent on activation of the insulin/IGF-like signaling pathway. These results reveal a remarkable homeostatic mechanism in postmitotic epithelia that ensures not only elimination of aberrant cells through cell competition but also proper organ-size control that involves compensatory cellular hypertrophy induced by physical parameters.",2013,"Wu-Min Deng, Yoichiro Tamori"

Sp1 modifies leg-to-wing transdetermination in Drosophila,23165292,10.1016/j.ydbio.2012.11.008,"During Drosophila development, the transcription factor Sp1 is necessary for proper leg growth and also to repress wing development.

In this report we demonstrate that reducing the gene copy number of Sp1 significantly increases both the frequency and the area of transdetermination in regenerating leg discs. By examining the expression of known Sp1 target genes, we also show that the proximo-distal patterning gene dachshund is downregulated dorsally, leading to a break in its normal ring-shaped expression pattern.

The N's and O's of Drosophila glycoprotein glycobiology,22936173,10.1007/s10719-012-9442-x,"The past 25 years have seen significant advances in understanding the diversity and functions of glycoprotein glycans in Drosophila melanogaster. Genetic screens have captured mutations that reveal important biological activities modulated by glycans, including protein folding and trafficking, as well as cell signaling, tissue morphogenesis, fertility, and viability. Many of these glycan functions have parallels in vertebrate development and disease, providing increasing opportunities to dissect pathologic mechanisms using Drosophila genetics. Advances in the sensitivity of structural analytic techniques have allowed the glycan profiles of wild-type and mutant tissues to be assessed, revealing novel glycan structures that may be functionally analogous to vertebrate glycans. This review describes a selected set of recent advances in understanding the functions of N-linked and O-linked (non-glycosaminoglycan) glycoprotein glycans in Drosophila with emphasis on their relatedness to vertebrate organisms.",2013,"Toshihiko Katoh, Michael Tiemeyer"
Multilayer perceptron classification of unknown volatile chemicals from the firing rates of insect olfactory sensory neurons and its application to biosensor design,23020109,10.1162/NECO_a_00386,"In this letter, we use the firing rates from an array of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, to train an artificial neural network (ANN) to distinguish different chemical classes of volatile odorants. Bootstrapping is implemented for the optimized networks, providing an accurate estimate of a network's predicted values. Initially a simple linear predictor was used to assess the complexity of the data and was found to provide low prediction performance. A nonlinear ANN in the form of a single multilayer perceptron (MLP) was also used, providing a significant increase in prediction performance. The effect of the number of hidden layers and hidden neurons of the MLP was investigated and found to be effective in enhancing network performance with both a single and a double hidden layer investigated separately. A hybrid array of MLPs was investigated and compared against the single MLP architecture. The hybrid MLPs were found to classify all vectors of the validation set, presenting the highest degree of prediction accuracy. Adjustment of the number of hidden neurons was investigated, providing further performance gain. In addition, noise injection was investigated, proving successful for certain network designs. It was found that the best-performing MLP was that of the double-hidden-layer hybrid MLP network without the use of noise injection. Furthermore, the level of performance was examined when different numbers of OSNs used were varied from the maximum of 24 to only 5 OSNs. Finally, the ideal OSNs were identified that optimized network performance. The results obtained from this study provide strong evidence of the usefulness of ANNs in the field of olfaction for the future realization of a signal processing back end for an artificial olfactory biosensor.",2013,"Charles P Unsworth, Edmund J Crampin, Luqman R Bachtiar, Richard D Newcomb"
Hydrogen peroxide and ecdysone in the cryoprotective dehydration strategy of Megaphorura arctica (Onychiuridae: Collembola),23143920,10.1002/arch.21073,"The Arctic springtail, Megaphorura arctica, survives sub-zero temperatures in a dehydrated state via trehalose-dependent cryoprotective dehydration. Regulation of trehalose biosynthesis is complex; based in part on studies in yeast and fungi, its connection with oxidative stress caused by exposure of cells to oxidants, such as hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂), or dehydration, is well documented. In this respect, we measured the amount of H₂O₂ and antioxidant enzyme activities (superoxide dismutases: copper, zinc--CuZnSOD and manganese containing--MnSOD, and catalase--CAT), as the regulatory components determining H₂O₂ concentrations, in Arctic springtails incubated at 5 °C (control) versus -2 °C (threshold temperature for trehalose biosynthesis). Because ecdysone also stimulates trehalose production in insects and regulates the expression of genes involved in redox homeostasis and antioxidant protection in Drosophila, we measured the levels of the active physiological form of ecdysone--20-hydroxyecdysone (20-HE). Significantly elevated H₂O₂ and 20-HE levels were observed in M. arctica incubated at -2 °C, supporting a link between ecdysone, H₂O₂, and trehalose levels during cryoprotective dehydration. CAT activity was found to be significantly lower in M. arctica incubated at -2 °C versus 5 °C, suggesting reduced H₂O₂ breakdown. Furthermore, measurement of the free radical composition in Arctic springtails incubated at 5 °C (controls) versus -2 °C by Electron Paramagnetic Resonance spectroscopy revealed melanin-derived free radicals at -2 °C, perhaps an additional source of H₂O₂. Our results suggest that H₂O₂ and ecdysone play important roles in the cryoprotective dehydration process in M. arctica, linked with the regulation of trehalose biosynthesis.",2013,"Zeljko D Popović, Melody S Clark, Jelena Purać, Roger M Worland, Gordana Grubor-Lajšić, Danijela Kojić, Edward T Petri, Miloš Mojović, Duško P Blagojević"
Segmentation and tracing of single neurons from 3D confocal microscope images,22835569,10.1109/TITB.2012.2209670,"In order to understand the brain, we need to first understand the morphology of neurons. In the neurobiology community, there have been recent pushes to analyze both neuron connectivity and the influence of structure on function. Currently, a technical road block that stands in the way of these studies is the inability to automatically trace neuronal structure from microscopy. On the image processing side, proposed tracing algorithms face difficulties in low contrast, indistinct boundaries, clutter, and complex branching structure. To tackle these difficulties, we develop Tree2Tree, a robust automatic neuron segmentation and morphology generation algorithm. Tree2Tree uses a local medial tree generation strategy in combination with a global tree linking to build a maximum likelihood global tree. Recasting the neuron tracing problem in a graph-theoretic context enables Tree2Tree to estimate bifurcations naturally, which is currently a challenge for current neuron tracing algorithms. Tests on cluttered confocal microscopy images of Drosophila neurons give results that correspond to ground truth within a margin of ±2.75% normalized mean absolute error.",2013,"Saurav Basu, Barry Condron, Scott Acton, Alla Aksel"

"Amino acid substitutions of Na,K-ATPase conferring decreased sensitivity to cardenolides in insects compared to mammals",24121093,10.1016/j.ibmb.2013.09.006,"Mutagenesis analyses and a recent crystal structure of the mammalian Na,K-ATPase have identified amino acids which are responsible for high affinity binding of cardenolides (such as ouabain) which at higher doses block the enzyme in the phosphorylated state. Genetic analysis of the Na,K-ATPase of insects adapted to cardenolides in their food plants revealed that some species possess substitutions which confer strongly increased resistance to ouabain in the mammalian enzyme such as the substitution T797A or combined substitutions at positions 111 and 122. To test for the effect of these mutations against the background of insect Na,K-ATPase, we here expressed the ouabain sensitive Na,K-ATPase α-subunit of Drosophila melanogaster together with the β-subunit Nrv3 in baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells and introduced the substitutions N122H, T797A, Q111T-N122H, Q111V-N122H, all of which have been observed in cardenolide-adapted insects. While all constructs showed similar expression levels, ouabain affinity of mutated Na,K-ATPases was reduced compared to the wild-type fly enzyme. Ouabain sensitivity of the ATPase activity in inhibition assays was significantly decreased by all mutations, yet whereas the IC₅₀ for the single mutations of N122H (61.0 μM) or T797A (63.3 μM) was increased roughly 250-fold relative to the wild-type (0.24 μM), the double mutations of Q111V-N122H (IC₅₀ 550 μM) and Q111T-N122H (IC₅₀ 583 μM) proved to be still more effective yielding a 2.250-fold increased resistance to ouabain. The double mutations identified in cardenolide-adapted insects are more effective in reducing ouabain sensitivity of the enzyme than those found naturally in the rat Na,K-ATPase (Q111R-N122D) or in mutagenesis screens of the mammalian enzyme. Obviously, the intense selection pressure on cardenolide exposed insects has resulted in very efficient substitutions that decrease cardenolide sensitivity extremely.",2013,"Susanne Dobler, Safaa Dalla, Herman G P Swarts, Jan B Koenderink"
Identification of metabolic pathways in Daphnia magna explaining hormetic effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and 4-nonylphenol using transcriptomic and phenotypic responses,23855649,10.1021/es4012299,"The molecular mechanisms explaining hormetic effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and 4-nonylphenol in Daphnia magna reproduction were studied in juveniles and adults. Transcriptome analyses showed changes in mRNA levels for 1796 genes in juveniles and 1214 genes in adults (out of 15000 total probes) exposed to two SSRIs (fluoxetine and fluvoxamine) or to 4-nonylphenol. Functional annotation of affected genes was improved by assuming the annotations of putatively homologous Drosophila genes. Self-organizing map analysis and partial least-square regression coupled with selectivity ratio procedures analyses allowed to define groups of genes with specific responses to the different treatments. Differentially expressed genes were analyzed for functional enrichment using Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes databases. Serotonin metabolism, neuronal developmental processes, and carbohydrates and lipid metabolism functional categories appeared as selectively affected by SSRI treatment, whereas 4-nonylphenol deregulated genes from the carbohydrate metabolism and the ecdysone regulatory pathway.

Time-lapse, three-dimensional data recorded in living embryos revealed that congression of chromosomes (the process whereby chromosomes move to form the metaphase plate) at prometaphase occurs as a wave, starting at the top of the nucleus near the embryo surface and proceeding through the nucleus to the bottom. The time-lapse analysis was augmented by a high-resolution analysis of fixed embryos where it was possible to unambiguously trace the three-dimensional paths of individual chromosomes. In prophase, the centromeres were found to be clustered at the top of the nucleus while the telomeres were situated at the bottom of the nucleus or towards the embryo interior. This polarized centromere-telomere orientation, perpendicular to the embryo surface, was preserved during the process of prometaphase chromosome congression. Correspondingly, breakdown of the nuclear envelope started at the top of the nucleus with the mitotic spindle being formed at the positions of the partial breakdown of the nuclear envelope.

However, opposite effects were shown, when the P element was introduced following irradiation: the number of unfertilized eggs and that of the flies killed at the larval and pupal stages has significantly increased, as compared to the control.

A 35-generation experiment using a complex habitat maze led to complete reproductive isolation between subpopulations using different spatiotemporal habitats.

Developmental genetic analysis of Contrabithorax mutations in Drosophila melanogaster,1977655,,"A developmental analysis of the Contrabithorax (Cbx) alleles offers the opportunity to examine the role of the Ultrabithorax (Ubx) gene in controlling haltere, as alternative to wing, morphogenesis in Drosophila.

The molecular data on these mutations, however, does not readily explain differences among mutant phenotypes. In this work, we have analyzed the ""apogenetic"" mosaic spots of transformation in their adult phenotype, in mitotic recombination clones and in the spatial distribution of Ubx proteins in imaginal discs. The results suggest that the phenotypes emerge from early clonality in some Cbx alleles, and from cell-cell interactions leading to recruitment of cells to Ubx gene expression in others.

We demonstrate that stg mRNA expressed from a heat shock promotor triggers mitosis, and an associated S phase, in G2 cells during these cycles. Hence, differential cell cycle timing at this developmental stage is controlled by stg. Finally, we use heat-induced stg expression to alter the normal pattern of embryonic mitoses.

The ovarian follicles of Sarcophaga and Drosophila consist of one oocyte and 15 nurse cells, the whole being surrounded by follicle cells. Although oocyte and nurse cells are genetically identical sibling cells, and although they are interconnected by cytoplasmic bridges, their physiology is very different. 2. The DNA content of the oocyte nucleus (germinal vesicle) never exceeds 4C, while values of polyploidisation up to 1024C have been measured in the nurse cells, this being dependent on their position within a follicle. 3. The nurse cell nuclei very actively synthesize RNA, while the germinal vesicle is almost completely inactive in this respect. 4. It has been possible to visualise the major cytoskeletal elements in the different ovarian cell types. Cellular markers of polarity and dorsoventral asymmetry have been described. 5. Electrophysiological measurements have been performed to find out whether or not the self-electrophoresis principle may be involved in polarised transport between nurse cells and oocyte. 6. Most of the vitellogenin is synthesized by the fat body but some follicle cells also synthesize small amounts. 7. The role of 20-OH ecdysone in the induction of vitellogenin synthesis in the fat body, as well as the presence of met-enkephalin like immunoreactivity in the gonads is well established in both species. Not so clear is the exact role of juvenile hormones and the nature of brain factors controlling ovarian development. 8.

An unusual Y chromosome of Drosophila simulans carrying amplified rDNA spacer without rRNA genes,2379820,,"The X and Y chromosomes of Drosophila melanogaster each contain a cluster of several hundred ribosomal RNA genes (rDNA). A nontranscribed spacer region separates adjacent rRNA genes and contains tandem copies of 240 bp repeats that include the initiation site for RNA polymerase I transcription. We show here that Drosophila simulans, a sibling species of D. melanogaster, contains few, if any, rRNA genes on its Y chromosome but carries instead a large block (3,000 kb or 12,500 copies) of 240 bp nontranscribed spacer repeats. The repeats are located at the tip of the long arm of the simulans Y chromosome, in contrast to their location among rRNA genes on the short arm of the Y chromosome of D. melanogaster. The bobbed mutation in homozygous females of D. melanogaster shortens and thins the bristles, owing to a partial deletion of rRNA genes on the X chromosome. The bristles of bobbed/Y males are normal owing to the presence of a full complement of rRNA genes on the Y chromosome. Peculiarly, in bobbed/Y males of D. simulans the short bristle phenotype does not return to normal but is enhanced by the presence of the Y chromosome. We propose that the 12,500 nontranscribed spacer repeats on the Y chromosome are responsible for this biological effect by competition for a protein factor(s) essential for normal levels of rDNA transcription at the X-linked locus.",1990,"A R Lohe, P A Roberts"
Assembly and disassembly of the Drosophila RNA polymerase II complex during transcription,1689291,,"Initiation of mRNA synthesis by RNA polymerase II occurs by a multistep pathway that involves the polymerase along with several auxiliary factors. Here I describe an analysis of the kinetics and mechanism of action of Drosophila RNA polymerase II by using the detergent Sarkosyl to inhibit different steps in the pathway leading to transcription initiation. The template DNA and Drosophila transcription factors assemble into a partially Sarkosyl-resistant initiation complex with a kinetically first order time course characterized by a t1/2 of about 3 min, and subsequent conversion of the initiation complex into the elongating complex occurs rapidly (less than 5 s). During the formation of the first two phosphodiester bonds, there is a stepwise transition from the initiation complex to the 0.25% Sarkosyl-resistant elongating polymerase. In contrast to the mammalian RNA polymerase II systems, the Drosophila extracts possess the ability to carry out many rounds (approximately 10) of transcription in vitro. Finally, the transcription factors are committed to the template DNA as an initiation complex, but then no longer appear to remain committed to the DNA after initiation of transcription. This finding suggests that there is complete assembly and disassembly of the transcription complex during each round of transcription by RNA polymerase II.",1990,J T Kadonaga
The torpedo (DER) receptor tyrosine kinase is required at multiple times during Drosophila embryogenesis,1425358,,"The torpedo (DER) gene of Drosophila, which encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase of the EGF receptor subfamily, is essential for oogenesis, embryogenesis and imaginal disc development. To gain insight into the nature of the signals transduced by the torpedo product, we have characterized the gene's loss-of-function phenotype in the embryo. Through the induction of germline clones, we provide a genetic demonstration that maternal torpedo product does not contribute to zygotic development. Thus, the embryonic lethal phenotypes examined accurately reflect the consequences of eliminating all gene activity from the zygote. Temperature-shift experiments with the conditional allele topIF26 show that torpedo is required at two distinct times during embryonic development: the gene is first needed for germband retraction and for the production of anterior, posterior and ventral cuticle, then later for the secretion of ventral denticles. Since denticle formation can be severely disrupted in topIF26 animals without affecting cuticle production, the early and late requirements for torpedo appear to be functionally unrelated. torpedo, therefore, is required at multiple times in the development of the ventral epidermis, and may transduce qualitatively different signals. Since the early requirement for torpedo correlates with the first visible defect in embryonic development, increased cell death in the amnioserosa, cephalic ectoderm and ventral epidermis, the abnormalities in cuticle production and germband shortening seen in the mutant may be secondary consequences of a primary defect in cell viability. Given that the onset of cell death in torpedo embryos is not preceded by any obvious defects in mitogenesis, the establishment of cell identities or the maintenance of gene expression, it is possible that torpedo transduces a signal necessary for cell survival per se during early embryogenesis. During late embryogenesis, torpedo may mediate the reception of a second signal which regulates ventral epidermal cell differentiation.",1992,"T Schüpbach, R Clifford"
Quantitative genetic variation in body size of mice from new mutations,1628812,,"To measure the amount of new genetic variation in 6-week weight of mice arising each generation from mutation, selection lines derived from an initially inbred strain were maintained for 25 generations. An analysis using an animal model with restricted maximum likelihood was applied to estimate a mutational genetic component of variance for the infinitesimal model of many genes of small effect. Assuming that the inbred base population was at a mutation-drift equilibrium, it is estimated that the heritability for body size has increased by 1.0% per generation, with lower and upper confidence limits of 0.6% and 1.6%, respectively. A model which includes a mutational genetic component of variance fits the data much better than one involving only base population genetic variance. A model with no genetic component fits the data very poorly. An environmental covariance of body size of mother and offspring was included in the model and accounts for 10% of the variance. By using information only from the observed response to selection, the estimated increase in heritability from mutation is 0.3% per generation. These values are higher than published estimates for the increase in variance from spontaneous mutations in bristle traits of Drosophila, for which there are extensive data, but similar to estimates for various skeletal traits in mice.",1992,"W G Hill, P D Keightley"
The mechanism of somatic inhibition of Drosophila P-element pre-mRNA splicing: multiprotein complexes at an exon pseudo-5' splice site control U1 snRNP binding,1322855,10.1101/gad.6.8.1386,"Somatic inhibition restricts splicing of the Drosophila P-element third intron (IVS3) to the germ line. We have exploited this simple system to provide a model for a mechanism of alternative pre-mRNA splicing. Biochemical complementation experiments revealed that Drosophila somatic extracts inhibited U1 snRNP binding to the 5' splice site. Using sensitive RNase protection and modification-interference assays, we found that U1 snRNP bound to a pseudo-5' splice site in the 5' exon and that multiprotein complexes bound to an adjacent site. Binding of these factors appeared to mediate the inhibitory effect, because mutations in the pseudo-5' splice sites blocked binding and activated splicing in vitro. Likewise, wild-type, but not mutant, 5' exon RNA titrated inhibitory factors away from the pre-mRNA and activated splicing. Thus, we have defined the pseudo-5' splice sites as crucial components of the regulatory element, correlated the inhibitory activity with specific RNA binding factors from Drosophila somatic cells, and provided a mechanistic description of somatic inhibition. Because the inhibitory activity involves general splicing functions such as protein recognition of 5' splice site sequences and changes in the distribution of bound U1 snRNP, our data may also provide insights into how splice sites are selected.",1992,"D C Rio, C W Siebel, L D Fresco"

Recombinant baculoviruses were constructed to place the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene under the control of promoters strongly active in the early, late, or very late stages of virus replication. In fully permissive cells, expression from a very late promoter was 2- to 3-fold higher than expression from a late promoter and 10- to 20-fold higher than expression from an early promoter or from a virus-borne insect promoter. In cell lines that do not support the efficient production of viral progeny, late-promoter-driven expression was similar to or surpassed very late promoter-driven expression. In nonpermissive insect cell lines, expression driven by an insect promoter derived from Drosophila melanogaster was higher than expression from the three viral promoters and was especially high in the Drosophila cell line tested. Surprisingly, late-promoter-driven expression, which is dependent on DNA replication, was higher than early-promoter-driven expression in three of four nonpermissive lines. In contrast, very late promoter-driven expression was quite limited in nonpermissive cell lines. The results indicate that the promoter used to drive foreign-gene expression strongly influences the range of insect cells which can efficiently support the production of the foreign protein during infection with recombinant baculoviruses.",1992,"T D Morris, L K Miller"
Chromosome interactions in P-M dysgenic male recombination of Drosophila melanogaster,1337533,10.1017/s0016672300030913,"The frequency, distribution and structure of P elements on the second and third chromosomes of Texas 1, a wild-type inbred strain of Drosophila melanogaster, were investigated by in situ hybridization. These autosomes were isolated individually and used as P-element donors to study the frequency and distribution of male recombination events generated on recipient chromosomes which were originally devoid of P sequences. The P-element array of chromosome 2 was shown to generate higher male recombination frequencies on chromosome 3 than vice versa, despite having fewer P factors and fewer P elements in general. This is likely to be due to the presence and distribution of specific P-deletion derivatives, which vary in their ability to repress P mobility. The male recombination generated on recipient chromosomes is associated with the insertion of donated P sequences, but only in a small minority of cases could a novel P-element site be detected at, or near, the recombination breakpoint. The majority of such breakpoints appear to be associated either with unsuccessful P insertion, or with the action of P transposase attracted by P elements newly inserted elsewhere on the recipient chromosome. Recent evidence also suggests that a small proportion of the breakpoints may be associated with the action of P transposase alone. Male recombination breakpoints appear to be distributed effectively at random along the recipient autosomes, and their frequency of occurrence was shown to correlate with the physical length of DNA available between markers, as revealed by the polytene map distance.",1992,"P Eggleston, K A Exley"
NTP Toxicology and Carcinogenesis Studies of Monochloroacetic Acid (CAS No. 79-11-8) in F344/N Rats and B6C3F1 Mice (Gavage Studies),12637963,,"Monochloroacetic acid, a colorless crystalline material, is used as a postemergence contact herbicide and as an intermediate in the synthesis of other organic compounds. Toxicology and carcinogenicity studies were conducted by administering monochloroacetic acid (99% pure) in deionized water by gavage to groups of F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice of each sex once daily, 5 days per week for 16 days, 13 weeks, or 2 years. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium, mouse lymphoma L5178Y cells, Chinese hamster ovary cells, and Drosophila melanogaster. 16-Day Studies: Groups of five rats of each sex received 0, 7.5, 15, 30, 60, or 120 mg monochloroacetic acid/kg body weight. Doses administered to mice were 0, 15, 30, 60, 120, or 240 mg/kg to groups of five males and 0, 30, 60, 120, 240, or 480 mg/kg to groups of five females. One of five male rats given 120 mg/kg died during the studies. Clear nasal discharge, lacrimation, or both, were observed in all groups of male and female rats receiving monochloroacetic acid. No compound-related gross lesions were observed in rats. All male mice given 240 mg/kg and all females given 240 or 480 mg/kg died during the studies. Hypoactivity, piloerection, ataxia, and lacrimation were observed in mice given 240 or 480 mg/kg. No compound-related gross lesions were observed in mice at necropsy. 13-Week Studies: Groups of 20 rats of each sex received 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, or 150 mg/kg monochloroacetic acid, and groups of 20 mice of each sex received doses of 0, 25, 50, 100, 150, or 200 mg/kg. Three to five animals in each dose group were killed at weeks 4 and 8 for the evaluation of hematology parameters. Compound-related deaths occurred in rats in the three highest dose groups (all males given 120 or 150 mg/kg, 9/10 males given 90 mg/kg, and all females given 90 to 150 mg/kg) and in mice given 200 mg/kg (all males and 2/10 females). Final mean body weights of surviving rats and mice receiving monochloroacetic acid were similar to those of controls. In rats, dose-related increases in blood urea nitrogen, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase levels were observed, and relative liver and kidney weights were elevated. There were no compound-related changes in the various hematologic or clinical pathology parameters in mice. A dose-related increase in the incidence and severity of cardiomyopathy was observed in male and female rats receiving monochloroacetic acid, and hepatocellular cytoplasmic vacuolization was observed in the high-dose mice that died during the studies. 2-Year Studies: Based on the mortality and compound-related histopathologic lesions observed in the 13-week studies, doses selected for the 2-year studies of monochloroacetic acid were 0, 15, or 30 mg/kg, administered to groups of 70 rats of each sex, and 0, 50, or 100 mg/kg, administered to groups of 60 mice of each sex. Interim evaluations were conducted on 10 rats per dose group after 6 months of treatment with monochloroacetic acid and on seven rats per dose group after 15 months of treatment. Body Weight and Survival in the 2-Year Studies: Mean body weights of low- and high-dose female and low-dose male rats receiving monochloroacetic acid were within 10% of those of controls throughout the studies; however, after week 30, the mean body weights of high-dose male rats were 4% to 8% less than those of controls. In mice, the mean body weights of dosed males were similar to controls, but those of low- and high-dose females were 6% to 10% less than control values after week 52. Survival of high-dose male and dosed female rats and high-dose male mice was significantly lower than that of controls (male rats: control, 27/53; low-dose, 21/53; high-dose, 16/53; female rats: 37/53; 19/53; 26/53; male mice: 46/60; 39/60; 21/60; female mice: 42/60; 40/60; 44/60). Neoplasms and Nonneoplastic Lesions in the 2-Year Studies: There was no compound-related increase in the incidence of neoplasms or nonneoplastic lesions in rats given monochloroacetic acid for 2 years. The incidence of uterine stromal polypss. The incidence of uterine stromal polyps in low- and high-dose female rats was slightly higher than that in controls (2/60; 7/57; 10/60). However, the incidence in the controls was unusually low, and those in the dosed groups were well within the range for NTP historical controls (mean: 21&percnt;, range: 10&percnt;-38&percnt;). Further, because the only malignant stromal neoplasm occurred in a control animal, the polyps were not considered to be related to the administration of monochloroacetic acid. Similarly, there was no monochloroacetic acid-related increase in the incidence of neoplasms in male or female mice, and malignant lymphoma occurred with a significant negative trend in dosed female mice. Increases in the incidence of inflammation of the mucosa of the nasal passages, respiratory epithelial metaplasia of the olfactory epithelium of the nose, and focal squamous cell hyperplasia of the forestomach occurred in dosed male and female mice. Genetic Toxicology: Monochloroacetic acid was not mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100, TA1535, TA1537, or TA98, with or without exogenous metabolic activation (S9). It induced trifluorothymidine resistance in L5178Y cells in the absence of S9 and induced sister chromatid exchanges without S9 in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Monochloroacetic acid did not induce a significant increase in chromosomal aberrations in Chinese hamster ovary cells, with or without S9. Monochloroacetic acid administered in feed was negative for the induction of sex-linked recessive lethal mutations in germ cells of male Drosophila melanogaster; however, when it was administered by injection, the results were equivocal. Conclusions: Under the conditions of these 2-year gavage studies, there was no evidence of carcinogenic activity for monochloroacetic acid in male or female F344/N rats given 15 or 30 mg/kg. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity for monochloroacetic acid in male or female B6C3F1 mice given 50 or 100 mg/kg. Monochloroacetic acid administration was associated with inflammatory lesions of the nasal mucosa, metaplasia of the olfactory epithelium, and squamous cell hyperplasia of the forestomach in male and female mice.

Using this motif, termed chromo box, we have cloned a mouse candidate modifier gene, M31, that also shows considerable sequence homology to Drosophila HP1.

Single amino acid substitutions in EGF-like elements of Notch and Delta modify Drosophila development and affect cell adhesion in vitro,1418999,10.1016/0896-6273(92)90238-9,"Notch locus EGF-like element mutations spl, altering eye development, and AxE2, affecting wing and sensilla development, are modified by mutations at Delta. It is shown that two allele-specific suppressors of spl involve single amino acid substitutions in the 4th (Dlsup5) and 9th (Dlsup4) EGF-like elements of the Delta protein. Cultured cells producing spl or AxE2 aggregate with cells producing wild-type Delta or Dlsup5 protein, and Dlsup5-producing cells adhere to cells producing wild-type Notch protein. However, spl,AxE2, and Dlsup5 are each defective in promoting these cell affinities, as none of the mutant proteins can compete with the corresponding wild-type proteins for formation of cell aggregates. Thus, widely separated EGF-like elements of Notch and Delta appear to participate in functional molecular interactions between the proteins. Dlsup5 does not improve adhesiveness of spl in vitro, so suppression in vivo may involve altered developmental signaling by spl-Dlsup5 complexes, rather than modified cell adhesion.",1992,"J F Krane, B Hassel, J A Campos-Ortega, C S Wesley, E Alcamo, T Lieber, M W Young"

The Drosophila couch potato protein is expressed in nuclei of peripheral neuronal precursors and shows homology to RNA-binding proteins,1427076,10.1101/gad.6.11.2125,"Through enhancer detection screens we have isolated and cloned an essential gene that is expressed in the neuronal precursors and their daughter cells in the Drosophila embryonic peripheral nervous system (PNS). The gene is named couch potato (cpo), because several partial loss-of-function alleles cause hypoactive behavior in adults. Here, we present evidence that the structure of the cpo locus is unusually complex: It spans > 100 kb, encodes three different messages, is differentially spliced, lacks an AUG initiation codon, and may encode three different proteins. Two putative Cpo proteins contain similar but nonidentical RNA-binding domains that are most homologous to the RNA-binding domains of the Drosophila embryonic lethal abnormal vision (elav) gene and a human brain protein that has been implicated in a paraneoplastic sensory neuropathy. Polyclonal antibodies raised against a fusion protein localize Cpo to the nucleus. Immunocytochemical studies demonstrate that the achaete-scute and daughterless genes are required for proper expression of cpo in the PNS but not in other cells that express cpo. On the basis of our observations, we present a model in which cpo is controlled by genes that determine cells to become PNS cells. Cpo, in turn, may control the processing of RNA molecules required for the proper functioning of the PNS.",1992,"J Pearlman, D D'Evelyn, H J Bellen, S Kooyer"
"HeT-A, a transposable element specifically involved in ""healing"" broken chromosome ends in Drosophila melanogaster",1324409,10.1128/mcb.12.9.3910,"Eight terminally deleted Drosophila melanogaster chromosomes have now been found to be ""healed."" In each case, the healed chromosome end had acquired sequence from the HeT DNA family, a complex family of repeated sequences found only in telomeric and pericentric heterochromatin. The sequences were apparently added by transposition events involving no sequence homology. We now report that the sequences transposed in healing these chromosomes identify a novel transposable element, HeT-A, which makes up a subset of the HeT DNA family. Addition of HeT-A elements to broken chromosome ends appears to be polar. The proximal junction between each element and the broken chromosome end is an oligo(A) tract beginning 54 nucleotides downstream from a conserved AATAAA sequence on the strand running 5' to 3' from the chromosome end. The distal (telomeric) ends of HeT-A elements are variably truncated; however, we have not yet been able to determine the extreme distal sequence of a complete element. Our analysis covers approximately 2,600 nucleotides of the HeT-A element, beginning with the oligo(A) tract at one end. Sequence homology is strong (greater than 75% between all elements studied). Sequence may be conserved for DNA structure rather than for protein coding; even the most recently transposed HeT-A elements lack significant open reading frames in the region studied. Instead, the elements exhibit conserved short-range sequence repeats and periodic long-range variation in base composition. These conserved features suggest that HeT-A elements, although transposable elements, may have a structural role in telomere organization or maintenance.",1992,"C Chin, K Valgeirsdottir, H Biessmann, A Lofsky, R W Levis, M L Pardue, B Ginther"

In spite of the large differences in primary structure of the alcohol binding region in the Adh enzyme in distantly related Drosophila species, the substrate specificity and stereospecificity have been retained. The topology of the alcohol binding region has been largely conserved during evolution. 3. The primary structures of the alcohol dehydrogenases (Adh) in the Sophophora subgenus is distinguished by few amino acid exchanges, and kinetic and activity parameters show that those at positions 14, 82, 192 and 214 are directly or indirectly involved in coenzyme binding. 4.

ELP and FTZ-F1 function in cells in the extremely early stage of development. A high degree of conservation between the two transcription factors during the evolution of these species indicates the importance of their functions in early-stage embryogenesis.

We find that sorting nexin CG1514 or Snazarus (Snz) associates with pLDs and regulates LD homeostasis at ER-PM contact sites. Loss of SNZ perturbs pLD organization, whereas Snz over-expression drives LD expansion, triacylglyceride production, starvation resistance, and lifespan extension through a DESAT1-dependent pathway.

Anti-Inflammatory Activity of A Polyphenolic Extract from Arabidopsis thaliana in In Vitro and In Vivo Models of Alzheimer's Disease,30736391,10.3390/ijms20030708,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder and the primary form of dementia in the elderly. One of the main features of AD is the increase in amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptide production and aggregation, leading to oxidative stress, neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Polyphenols are well known for their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects and have been proposed as possible therapeutic agents against AD. Here, we investigated the effects of a polyphenolic extract of Arabidopsis thaliana (a plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family) on inflammatory response induced by Aβ. BV2 murine microglia cells treated with both Aβ25⁻35 peptide and extract showed a lower pro-inflammatory (IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α) and a higher anti-inflammatory (IL-4, IL-10, IL-13) cytokine production compared to cells treated with Aβ only. The activation of the Nrf2-antioxidant response element signaling pathway in treated cells resulted in the upregulation of heme oxygenase-1 mRNA and in an increase of NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 activity. To establish whether the extract is also effective against Aβ-induced neurotoxicity in vivo, we evaluated its effect on the impaired climbing ability of AD Drosophila flies expressing human Aβ1⁻42. Arabidopsis extract significantly restored the locomotor activity of these flies, thus confirming its neuroprotective effects also in vivo.

Transgenerational Obesity and Healthy Aging in Drosophila,31231757,10.1093/gerona/glz154,"Substantial evidence suggests that individuals born to overweight and obese parents suffer detrimental health consequences that dramatically decrease healthy aging. The number of obese individuals worldwide now exceeds the number of under- and malnourished individuals.

Additionally, obesity is associated with an accelerated onset of age-related ailments, such as cancers and inflammation. The importance of dietary interventions to reduce the incidence of obesity is magnified by emerging evidence that parental physiology can predispose future generations to poor health outcomes. Characterizing and understanding these effects, and how they are mediated, is important if we are to continue to drive improvements to population health. In this article, we synthesize evidence for the intergenerational and transgenerational phenotypic effects of parental obesity.

"ROS Inhibits Cell Growth by Regulating 4EBP and S6K, Independent of TOR, during Development",31063760,10.1016/j.devcel.2019.04.008,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS), despite having damaging roles, serve as signaling molecules regulating diverse biological and physiological processes. Employing in vivo genetic studies in Drosophila, we show that besides causing G1-S arrest by activation of Dacapo, ROS can simultaneously inhibit cell growth by regulating the expression of 4EBP and S6K. This is achieved by triggering a signaling cascade that includes Ask1, JNK, and FOXO independent of the Tsc-TOR growth regulatory pathway. Qualitative and quantitative differences in the types of ROS molecules generated dictate whether cells undergo G1-S arrest only or experience blocks in both cell proliferation and growth. Importantly, during normal development, this signaling cascade is triggered by ecdysone in late larval fat body cells to restrict their growth prior to pupation by antagonizing insulin signaling.

A Neuronal Relay Mediates a Nutrient Responsive Gut/Fat Body Axis Regulating Energy Homeostasis in Adult Drosophila,30344016,10.1016/j.cmet.2018.09.021,"The control of systemic metabolic homeostasis involves complex inter-tissue programs that coordinate energy production, storage, and consumption, to maintain organismal fitness upon environmental challenges.

Bursicon α/DLgr2 regulate energy metabolism through a neuronal relay leading to the restriction of glucagon-like, adipokinetic hormone (AKH) production by the corpora cardiaca and subsequent modulation of AKH receptor signaling within the adipose tissue. Impaired Bursicon α/DLgr2 signaling leads to exacerbated glucose oxidation and depletion of energy stores with consequent reduced organismal resistance to nutrient restrictive conditions.

Dynamic MAPK signaling activity underlies a transition from growth arrest to proliferation in Drosophila scribble mutant tumors,31371383,10.1242/dmm.040147,"Human tumors exhibit plasticity and evolving capacity over time. It is difficult to study the mechanisms of how tumors change over time in human patients, in particular during the early stages when a few oncogenic cells are barely detectable. Here, we used a Drosophila tumor model caused by loss of scribble (scrib), a highly conserved apicobasal cell polarity gene, to investigate the spatial-temporal dynamics of early tumorigenesis events. The fly scrib mutant tumors have been successfully used to model many aspects of tumorigenesis processes. However, it is still unknown whether Drosophila scrib mutant tumors exhibit plasticity and evolvability along the temporal axis. We found that scrib mutant tumors displayed different growth rates and cell cycle profiles over time, indicative of a growth arrest-to-proliferation transition as the scrib mutant tumors progress. Longitudinal bulk and single-cell transcriptomic analysis of scrib mutant tumors revealed that the MAPK pathway, including JNK and ERK signaling activities, showed quantitative changes over time. We found that high JNK signaling activity caused G2/M cell cycle arrest in early scrib mutant tumors. In addition, JNK signaling activity displayed a radial polarity with the JNKhigh cells located at the periphery of scrib mutant tumors, providing an inherent mechanism that leads to an overall decrease in JNK signaling activity over time. We also found that ERK signaling activity, in contrast to JNK activity, increased over time and promoted growth in late-stage scrib mutant tumors. Furthermore, high JNK signaling activity repressed ERK signaling activity in early scrib mutant tumors. Together, these data demonstrate that dynamic MAPK signaling activity, fueled by intratumor heterogeneity derived from tissue topological differences, drives a growth arrest-to-proliferation transition in scrib mutant tumors.This article has an associated First Person interview with the joint first authors of the paper.",2019,"Tiantian Ji, Varun Sridhar, Lina Zhang, Shengshuo Huang, Andrew Alan Smith, Clemens Cabernard, Ying Wang, Mingxi Deng, Yan Yan, Jiguang Wang, Tri Thanh Pham"
Fluctuations in nutrient composition affect male reproductive output in Drosophila melanogaster,31493390,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2019.103940,"Insects are known to selectively balance their intake of protein and carbohydrate to optimize reproduction and survival. For insects who feed on decomposing fruit, fluctuations in macronutrient composition occur as fruits ripe and decomposition progresses which may challenge optimal resource allocation. Using Drosophila melanogaster, we tested the effect of macronutrient fluctuations and the variability of these fluctuations on starvation resistance and components of reproductive output; traits known to be sensitive to different protein to carbohydrate (P:C) ratios in the diet. For 8 days, flies were fed the same protein to carbohydrate (P:C) ratio (constant feeding), or fed diets with fluctuations in P:C ratio on each day; these fluctuations being regular (predictably fluctuating) or irregular (unpredictably fluctuating). The three feeding regimes yielded the same average P:C ratio across the duration of the experiment. We found no difference in starvation resistance across the feeding regimes. Interestingly, there was a sexual dimorphism in the effect on reproductive output with males performing worst in the unpredictable feeding regime, and with no effect of feeding regime on female performance. Our study provides evidence for means of adapting to fluctuating macronutrient composition and suggests females are more tactful than males in storing and allocating resources for reproduction.",2019,"Lucy Rebecca Davies, Mads F Schou, Volker Loeschcke, Torsten N Kristensen"
Oxidative Effects of Gemifloxacin on Some Biological Traits of Drosophila melanogaster (Diptera: Drosophilidae),30994172,10.1093/ee/nvz039,"In recent times, several studies have been undertaken on the artificial mass-rearing of insects in which clinical antibacterial antibiotics, including gemifloxacin, which is a DNA gyrase and topoisomerases inhibitor, are amended into the diet to control microbial contamination and preserve diet. The findings of these studies have suggested the possibility that these antibiotics influence the biological traits of insects in relation to their oxidative effects. This study investigated the effects of gemifloxacin on Drosophila melanogaster (Meigen) survival rates, development times, and male-female adult longevity. And we also determined the effects of gemifloxacin on lipid peroxidation product, malondialdehyde, protein carbonyl levels, and glutathione S-transferase activity of fruit fly eggs. First instars were fed on artificial diets containing 150, 300, 600, and 900 mg/liter concentrations of gemifloxacin until adult emergence. Our results indicate that sublethal effects of gemifloxacin are likely to significantly impair adult fitness and life-history parameters in D. melanogaster, probably because of its oxidative effects.",2019,"Kemal Büyükgüzel, Nilay Aslan, Ender Büyükgüzel"
Genetic interactions between Protein Kinase D and Lobe mutants during eye development of Drosophila melanogaster,31889943,10.1186/s41065-019-0113-9,"Background: In Drosophila, the development of the fly eye involves the activity of several, interconnected pathways that first define the presumptive eye field within the eye anlagen, followed by establishment of the dorso-ventral boundary, and the regulation of growth and apoptosis. In Lobe (L) mutant flies, parts of the eye or even the complete eye are absent because the eye field has not been properly defined. Manifold genetic interactions indicate that L influences the activity of several signalling pathways, resulting in a conversion of eye tissue into epidermis, and in the induction of apoptosis. As information on the molecular nature of the L mutation is lacking, the underlying molecular mechanisms are still an enigma. Results: We have identified Protein Kinase D (PKD) as a strong modifier of the L mutant phenotype. PKD belongs to the PKC/CAMK class of Ser/Thr kinases that have been involved in diverse cellular processes including stress resistance and growth. Despite the many roles of PKD, Drosophila PKD null mutants are without apparent phenotype apart from sensitivity to oxidative stress. Here we report an involvement of PKD in eye development in the sensitized genetic background of Lobe. Absence of PKD strongly enhanced the dominant eye defects of heterozygous L 2 flies, and decreased their viability. Moreover, eye-specific overexpression of an activated isoform of PKD considerably ameliorated the dominant L 2 phenotype. This genetic interaction was not allele specific but similarly seen with three additional, weaker L alleles (L 1 , L 5 , L G ), demonstrating its specificity. Conclusions: We propose that PKD-mediated phosphorylation is involved in underlying processes causing the L phenotype, i.e. in the regulation of growth, the epidermal transformation of eye tissue and apoptosis, respectively.",2019,"Dieter Maier, Anja C Nagel, Anette Preiss"
Microbial-Based Double-Stranded RNA Production to Develop Cost-Effective RNA Interference Application for Insect Pest Management,31040730,10.1177/1179543319840323,"RNA interference (RNAi) is a convenient tool to identify and characterize biological functions in organisms. Recently, it has become an alternative to chemical insecticides as a biologically based control agent. This promising technology has the potential to avoid many problems associated with conventional chemical insecticides. In order for RNAi application to be practical for field use, a major hurdle is the development of a cost-effective system of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) production for a large quantity of dsRNA. A handful of research reports has demonstrated microbial-based dsRNA production using L4440 vector and HT115 (DE3) Escherichia coli for application to vertebrate and invertebrate systems. However, the dsRNA yield, production efficiency, and biological purity from this in vitro system is still unclear. Thus, our study detailed biochemical and molecular tools for large-scale dsRNA production using the microbial system and investigated the production efficiency and yield of crude and purified dsRNAs. An unrelated insect gene, green fluorescent protein (GFP), and an insect neuropeptide gene, pyrokinin (PK) identified from Drosophila suzukii, were used to construct the recombinant L4440 to be expressed in the HT115 (DE3) cell. A considerable amount of dsRNA, 19.5 µg/mL of liquid culture, was isolated using ultrasonic disruption followed by phenol extraction. The sonication method was further evaluated to extract crude dsRNA without the additional phenol extraction and nuclease treatments and also to reduce potential bacterial viability. The results suggest that the ultrasonic method saved time and costs to isolate crude dsRNA directly from large volumes of cell culture without E coli contamination. We investigated whether the injection of PK dsRNA into flies resulted in increased adult mortality, but it was not statistically significant at 95% confidence level. In this study, the microbial-based dsRNA production has potential for applied RNAi technology to complement current insect pest management practices.",2019,"Robert R Martin, Kelly Donahue, Seung-Joon Ahn, Youngho Koh, Man-Yeon Choi"
Transcription repressor-mediated control of engulfment receptor expression in Drosophila phagocytes,31063732,10.1016/j.yexcr.2019.04.032,"We previously reported that Drosophila phagocytes enhance their phagocytic activity after apoptotic cell engulfment accompanied by the activation of the transcription repressor Tailless and an increase in the levels of engulfment receptors. We herein investigated the underlying mechanisms. We found that Tailless phosphorylation levels decreased in Drosophila phagocytes following the stimulation with apoptotic cells. Anticipating the involvement of another transcription repressor, we examined the possible involvement of Krüppel, a bibliographically identified repressor whose expression is controlled by Tailless. The level of Krüppel in phagocytes decreased after the stimulation in a Tailless-dependent manner. The RNAi knockdown of Krüppel abrogated increases in the levels of engulfment receptors and phagocytic activity in stimulated phagocytes. The binding of Krüppel to the 5'-upstream regions of genes coding for engulfment receptors was demonstrated. These results suggest the following pathway: Tailless is activated by de-phosphorylation; Krüppel expression is inhibited by Tailless; the transcription of engulfment receptors-encoding genes is augmented due to a decrease of inhibition by Krüppel; and finally phagocytic activity is enhanced.",2019,"Chiharu Hoshi, Yoshinobu Nakanishi, Takuto Kanetani, Naoshi Dohmae, Mai Sono, Hiroshi Nakayama, Saori Nonaka"
Horizontal Transfer of Bacterial Cytolethal Distending Toxin B Genes to Insects,31236589,10.1093/molbev/msz146,"Horizontal gene transfer events have played a major role in the evolution of microbial species, but their importance in animals is less clear.

We found insect-encoded cdtB genes are most closely related to orthologs from bacteriophage that infect Candidatus Hamiltonella defensa, a bacterial mutualistic symbiont of aphids that confers resistance to parasitoid wasps. In drosophilids, cdtB orthologs are highly expressed during the parasitoid-prone larval stage and encode a protein with ancestral DNase activity.

Evolution of Ovipositor Length in Drosophila suzukii Is Driven by Enhanced Cell Size Expansion and Anisotropic Tissue Reorganization,31178315,10.1016/j.cub.2019.05.020,"Morphological diversity is dominated by variation in body proportion [1], which can be described with scaling relationships and mathematical equations, following the pioneering work of D'Arcy Thompson [2] and Julian Huxley [3]. Yet, the cellular processes underlying divergence in size and shape of morphological traits between species remain largely unknown [4-8]. Here, we compare the ovipositors of two related species, Drosophila melanogaster and D. suzukii. D. suzukii has switched its egg-laying niche from rotting to ripe fruit [9]. Along with this shift, the D. suzukii ovipositor has undergone a significant change in size and shape [10]. Using an allometric approach, we find that, while adult ovipositor width has hardly changed between the species, D. suzukii ovipositor length is almost double that of D. melanogaster. We show that this difference mostly arises in a 6-h time window during pupal development. We observe that the developing ovipositors of the two species comprise an almost identical number of cells, with a similar profile of cell shapes and orientations. After cell division stops, we find that the ovipositor area continues to grow in both species through the isotropic expansion of cell apical area and the anisotropic cellular reorganization of the tissue. Remarkably, we find that the lengthening of the D. suzukii ovipositor compared to that of D. melanogaster results from the combination of the accelerated expansion of apical cell size and the enhanced anisotropic rearrangement of cells in the tissue. Therefore, the quantitative fine-tuning of morphogenetic processes can drive evolutionary changes in organ size and shape.",2019,"Benjamin Prud'homme, Jack E Green, Nicolas Gompel, Benoit Aigouy, Emmanuelle Médina Caturegli, Matthieu Cavey"
Voltages and resistances of the anterior Malpighian tubule of Drosophila melanogaster,31043456,10.1242/jeb.201574,"The small size of Malpighian tubules in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has discouraged measurements of the transepithelial electrical resistance. The present study introduces two methods for measuring the transepithelial resistance in isolated D . melanogaster Malpighian tubules using conventional microelectrodes and PClamp hardware and software. The first method uses three microelectrodes to measure the specific transepithelial resistance normalized to tubule length or luminal surface area for comparison with resistances of other epithelia. The second method uses only two microelectrodes to measure the relative resistance for comparing before and after effects in a single Malpighian tubule. Knowledge of the specific transepithelial resistance allows the first electrical model of electrolyte secretion by the main segment of the anterior Malpighian tubule of D . melanogaster The electrical model is remarkably similar to that of the distal Malpighian tubule of Aedes aegypti when tubules of Drosophila and Aedes are studied in vitro under the same experimental conditions. Thus, despite 189 millions of years of evolution separating these two genera, the electrophysiological properties of their Malpighian tubules remains remarkably conserved.",2019,Klaus W Beyenbach

Here we profile the age-dependent dynamics of long-lived proteomes in Drosophila by mass spectrometry using stable isotope switching coupled with antibody-enriched ubiquitylome analysis. Our data describe landscapes of long-lived proteins in somatic and reproductive tissues of Drosophila during adult lifespan, and reveal a preferential ubiquitylation of older long-lived proteins. We identify an age-modulated increase of ubiquitylation on long-lived histone 2A protein in Drosophila, which is evolutionarily conserved in mouse, monkey, and human. A reduction of ubiquitylated histone 2A in mutant flies is associated with longevity and healthy lifespan.

Sexual selection favours good or bad genes for pathogen resistance depending on males' pathogen exposure,31064300,10.1098/rspb.2019.0226,"Resistance to pathogens is often invoked as an indirect benefit of female choice, but experimental evidence for links between father's sexual success and offspring resistance is scarce and equivocal. Two proposed mechanisms might generate such links. Under the first, heritable resistance to diverse pathogens depends on general immunocompetence; owing to shared condition dependence, male sexual traits indicate immunocompetence independently of the male's pathogen exposure. By contrast, other hypotheses (e.g. Hamilton-Zuk) assume that sexual traits only reveal heritable resistance if the males have been exposed to the pathogen. The distinction between the two mechanisms has been neglected by experimental studies. We show that Drosophila melanogaster males that are successful in mating contests (one female with two males) sire sons that are substantially more resistant to the intestinal pathogen Pseudomonas entomophila-but only if the males have themselves been exposed to the pathogen before the mating contest. By contrast, sons of males sexually successful in the absence of pathogen exposure are less resistant than sons of unsuccessful males. We detected no differences in daughters' resistance. Thus, while sexual selection may have considerable consequences for offspring resistance, these consequences may be sex-specific. Furthermore, contrary to the 'general immunocompetence' hypothesis, these consequences can be positive or negative depending on the epidemiological context under which sexual selection operates.",2019,"Patrick Joye, Tadeusz J Kawecki"
The Tenets of Teneurin: Conserved Mechanisms Regulate Diverse Developmental Processes in the Drosophila Nervous System,30760977,10.3389/fnins.2019.00027,"To successfully integrate a neuron into a circuit, a myriad of developmental events must occur correctly and in the correct order. Neurons must be born and grow out toward a destination, responding to guidance cues to direct their path. Once arrived, each neuron must segregate to the correct sub-region before sorting through a milieu of incorrect partners to identify the correct partner with which they can connect. Finally, the neuron must make a synaptic connection with their correct partner; a connection that needs to be broadly maintained throughout the life of the animal while remaining responsive to modes of plasticity and pruning. Though many intricate molecular mechanisms have been discovered to regulate each step, recent work showed that a single family of proteins, the Teneurins, regulates a host of these developmental steps in Drosophila - an example of biological adaptive reuse. Teneurins first influence axon guidance during early development. Once neurons arrive in their target regions, Teneurins enable partner matching and synapse formation in both the central and peripheral nervous systems. Despite these diverse processes and systems, the Teneurins use conserved mechanisms to achieve these goals, as defined by three tenets: (1) transsynaptic interactions with each other, (2) membrane stabilization via an interaction with and regulation of the cytoskeleton, and (3) a role for presynaptic Ten-a in regulating synaptic function. These processes are further distinguished by (1) the nature of the transsynaptic interaction - homophilic interactions (between the same Teneurins) to engage partner matching and heterophilic interactions (between different Teneurins) to enable synaptic connectivity and the proper apposition of pre- and postsynaptic sites and (2) the location of cytoskeletal regulation (presynaptic cytoskeletal regulation in the CNS and postsynaptic regulation of the cytoskeleton at the NMJ). Thus, both the roles and the mechanisms governing them are conserved across processes and synapses. Here, we will highlight the contributions of Drosophila synaptic biology to our understanding of the Teneurins, discuss the mechanistic conservation that allows the Teneurins to achieve common neurodevelopmental goals, and present new data in support of these points. Finally, we will posit the next steps for understanding how this remarkably versatile family of proteins functions to control multiple distinct events in the creation of a nervous system.",2019,"Michael A Aimino, Timothy J Mosca, Alison T DePew"
"Evolution of the Torso activation cassette, a pathway required for terminal patterning and moulting",30548465,10.1111/imb.12560,"Embryonic terminal patterning and moulting are critical developmental processes in insects. In Drosophila and Tribolium both of these processes are regulated by the Torso-activation cassette (TAC). The TAC consists of a common receptor, Torso, ligands Trunk and prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH), and the spatially restricted protein Torso-like, with combinations of these elements acting mechanistically to activate the receptor in different developmental contexts. In order to trace the evolutionary history of the TAC we determined the presence or absence of TAC components in the genomes of arthropods. Our analyses reveal that Torso, Trunk and PTTH are evolutionarily labile components of the TAC with multiple individual or combined losses occurring in the arthropod lineages leading to and within the insects. These losses are often correlated, with both ligands and receptor missing from the genome of the same species. We determine that the PTTH gene evolved in the common ancestor of Hemiptera and Holometabola, and is missing from the genomes of a number of species with experimentally demonstrated PTTH activity, implying another molecule may be involved in ecdysis in these species. In contrast, the torso-like gene is a common component of pancrustacean genomes.",2019,"J Skelly, E J Duncan, C Pushparajan, P K Dearden"
Electrophysiological and Behavioral Responses of Drosophila suzukii (Diptera: Drosophilidae) Towards the Leaf Volatile β-cyclocitral and Selected Fruit-Ripening Volatiles,31433837,10.1093/ee/nvz092,"The spotted-wing drosophila, Drosophila suzukii Matsumura (Diptera: Drosophilidae), is attracted to numerous volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from several ripening, small fruit crops. However, the strawberry leaf terpenoid, β-cyclocitral, is reportedly very attractive to D. suzukii (but not to all Drosophila spp.). This suggests that leaf and fruit VOCs may be critical sources needed to further develop a more species-specific D. suzukii monitoring lure, or semiochemically based attract-and-kill systems. This study investigated the electrophysiological responses of male and female D. suzukii towards selected host fruit-ripening VOCs and β-cyclocitral, along with behavioral responses toward combined fruit VOCs with β-cyclocitral. Electroantennogram (EAG) results revealed a positive dose-response, for both sexes, as concentrations increased for all VOCs tested. For β-cyclocitral, hexyl acetate and methyl butyrate, the mean male EAG responses were significantly greater than the female responses at lower doses. In caged behavioral bioassays, only in the β-cyclocitral treatments were the mean number of flies captured (sexes combined) significantly greater than that captured in solvent (mineral oil) controls. Our study has demonstrated that while single fruit-based VOCs alone are not enough to cause a strong behavioral attraction by both male and female D. suzukii, the addition of β-cyclocitral did produce a significant attraction response from both sexes. In both bioassays, males had higher responses to β-cyclocitral than females, which suggest a greater sensitivity to this compound. Further studies are needed to ascertain the role β-cyclocitral may play in the development of a more species-specific D. suzukii monitoring lure.",2019,"Bruce A Barrett, L Grant Bolton, Jaime C Piñero"

Our conclusions are supported by formal genetics with X-Y translocation lines. Reverse transcription-PCR was successful in linking together unmapped sequence fragments from the whole-genome shotgun assembly, although some sequences were missing altogether from the shotgun effort and had to be generated de novo. We also found a previously undescribed Y gene, polycystine-related (PRY).

The evolutionarily conserved BMP-binding protein Twisted gastrulation promotes BMP signalling,10866189,10.1038/35015500,"Dorsal-ventral patterning in vertebrate and Drosophila embryos requires a conserved system of extracellular proteins to generate a positional information gradient.

The data suggest a molecular mechanism by which xTsg dislodges latent BMPs bound to Chordin BMP-binding fragments generated by Xolloid cleavage, providing a permissive signal that allows high BMP signalling in the embryo.

Localisation of the DmCdc45 DNA replication factor in the mitotic cycle and during chorion gene amplification,11024168,10.1093/nar/28.20.3897,"The cdc45 protein was originally identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and shown to be essential for initiation of eukaryotic DNA replication. Subsequent isolation and characterisation of the corresponding genes from fission yeast, Xenopus and mammals also support a replication role for the protein in these species. They further suggest that during the course of its function cdc45 interacts with a number of other replication proteins, including minichromosome maintenance proteins, the origin recognition complex and DNA polymerase alpha. We have cloned the gene coding for cdc45 protein from Drosophila melanogaster. We have analysed the expression pattern of the cdc45 protein throughout the cell cycle and the life cycle using a combination of indirect immunofluorescence and subcellular fractionation. Our data show that cellular localisation and developmental regulation of the protein is consistent with a role in DNA replication. DmCdc45 is predominantly expressed in proliferating cells. In addition, its subcellular location is nuclear during interphase and the protein shows association with chromatin. The chromatin-associated form of the protein shows a post-translational modification, which may be involved in control of the action of the protein. DmCdc45 shows interactions with mcm proteins, however, the interactions detected show some specificity, perhaps suggesting a preferential association with particular mcm proteins. In addition we show that a stoichiometric mcm interaction may not be obligatory for the function of cdc45 in follicle cell replication, because, unlike the mcm proteins, DmCdc45 localises to the chorion amplification foci in the follicle cells of the ovary.",2000,"S Cotterill, D Loebel, H Huikeshoven"
dTcf antagonises Wingless signalling during the development and patterning of the wing in Drosophila,11128568,,"Members of the Tcf family of HMG box-containing transcriptional regulators mediate Wnt signalling in the nucleus. Current models suggest that in the absence of Wnt signalling, Tcf interacts with the repressor protein Groucho and suppresses the expression of Wnt targets. Wnt signalling leads to increases in the level of cytoplasmic beta catenin, which enters the nucleus, displaces Tcf from Groucho and leads to transcriptional activation. In order to test this model we have studied the effects of Drosophila Tcf (dTcf) on signalling by Wingless, a Drosophila member of the Wnt family. We show that overexpression of wild-type dTcf during the development and patterning of the wing antagonises Wingless signalling. Furthermore, increases in the concentration of Armadillo, the Drosophila homologue of beta catenin, do not appear to be sufficient to trigger the change from antagonism to activation. This leads us to suggest that the inactivation of the repressive activity of dTcf requires the activity of Wingless in a manner that is independent of Armadillo. We observe that a Groucho molecule devoid of the WD40 repeats can interact with dTcf and acts as a dominant repressor of Wingless signalling in vivo and in vitro. Coexpression of this molecule with dTcf however, does not lead to enhancement of the repressive effects of dTcf alone. This observation suggests that repression by dTcf might not simply be mediated by an interaction with Groucho but that dTcf may have an intrinsic repressive activity that has to be antagonised by Wingless signalling.",2000,"N Lawrence, A M Arias, D Hartley, P Dearden, H Clevers, J Roose"

We now describe a Drosophila tmAC, DAC39E, which employs a novel means for regulating its expression; differential exon utilization results in a developmental switch in DAC39E protein. DAC39E protein sequence is most closely related to mammalian type III AC, and it is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) and olfactory organs, suggesting a role in processing sensory signaling inputs. DAC39E catalytic activity is inhibited by micromolar concentrations of calcium; therefore, DAC39E is oppositely regulated by calcium compared to the only other tmAC shown to be expressed in the Drosophila CNS, Rutabaga AC.

Disruption of gastrulation and heparan sulfate biosynthesis in EXT1-deficient mice,10926768,10.1006/dbio.2000.9798,"Mutations in the EXT1 gene are responsible for human hereditary multiple exostosis type 1. The Drosophila EXT1 homologue, tout-velu, regulates Hedgehog diffusion and signaling, which play an important role in tissue patterning during both invertebrate and vertebrate development. The EXT1 protein is also required for the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans that bind Hedgehog. In this study, we generated EXT1-deficient mice by gene targeting. EXT1 homozygous mutants fail to gastrulate and generally lack organized mesoderm and extraembryonic tissues, resulting in smaller embryos compared to normal littermates. RT-PCR analysis of markers for visceral endoderm and mesoderm development indicates the delayed and abnormal development of both of these tissues. Immunohistochemical staining revealed a visceral endoderm pattern of Indian hedgehog (Ihh) in wild-type E6.5 embryos. However, in both EXT1-deficient embryos and wild-type embryos treated with heparitinase I, Ihh failed to associate with the cells. The effect of the EXT1 deletion on heparan sulfate formation was tested by HPLC and cellular glycosyltransferase activity assays. Heparan sulfate synthesis was abolished in EXT1 -/- ES cells and decreased to less than 50% in +/- cell lines.

A gain-of-function mutant of patched dissects different responses to the hedgehog gradient,11112325,10.1006/dbio.2000.9862,"The Hedgehog (Hh) signal has an inductive role during Drosophila development. Patched is part of the Hedgehog-receptor complex and shows a repressive function on the signaling cascade, which is alleviated in the presence of Hh. Herein, we identify the first dominant gain-of-function allele of patched, Confused (patched(Con)). Analysis of the patched(Con) allele led us to uncover novel features of the reception and function of the Hh signal. At least three different regions of gene expression were identified and a gradient of cell affinities was established in response to Hh. A new state of Cubitus interruptus activity responsible for the activation of araucan and caupolican genes of the iroquois complex, independent of Fused kinase function, was shown. In the disc, patched(Con) behaved like fused mutants and was rescued by Suppressor of fused mutations. However, fused mutants are embryonic lethal while patched(Con) is not, suggesting that Patched could interpret Hedgehog signaling differently in the embryo and in the adult.",2000,"I Guerrero, J L Mullor"
Chemosensory proteins of Locusta migratoria (Orthoptera: Acrididae),10732991,10.1016/s0965-1748(99)00121-6,"We describe a family of proteins abundantly expressed in the chemoreception sensory organs, the antennae and legs, of the desert locust, Locusta migratoria (Orthoptera, Acrididae). Using polymerase chain reaction-based approaches and homology screenings, ""OS-D""-like proteins were identified in L. migratoria. The different sub-types (LmigOS-Ds) are very similar to each other and share about 50-70% identity with OS-Ds from Drosophila melanogaster and Periplaneta americana. A similar degree of identity was also observed with moth OS-Ds. Northern blot analysis revealed a strong expression of the LmigOS-Ds in the antennae and legs, suggesting their involvement in chemosensory processes. Despite the lack of direct evidence for their role in chemosensation, LmigOS-Ds and their homologs seem to constitute a large protein family, characterized by a striking abundance and diversity among insect chemosensory organs.",2000,"J F Picimbon, K Dietrich, J Krieger, H Breer"

Identification of novel multi-transmembrane proteins from genomic databases using quasi-periodic structural properties,11108699,10.1093/bioinformatics/16.9.767,"Motivation: Identification of novel G protein-coupled receptors and other multi-transmembrane proteins from genomic databases using structural features. Results: Here we describe a new algorithm for identifying multi-transmembrane proteins from genomic databases with a specific application to identifying G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that we call quasi-periodic feature classifier (QFC). The QFC algorithm uses concise statistical variables as the 'feature space' to characterize the quasi-periodic physico-chemical properties of multi-transmembrane proteins. For the case of identifying GPCRs, the variables are then used in a non-parametric linear discriminant function to separate GPCRs from non-GPCRs. The algorithm runs in time linearly proportional to the number of sequences, and performance on a test dataset shows 96% positive identification of known GPCRs. The QFC algorithm also works well with short random segments of proteins and it positively identified GPCRs at a level greater than 90% even with segments as short as 100 amino acids. The primary advantage of the algorithm is that it does not directly use primary sequence patterns which may be subject to sampling bias. The utility of the new algorithm has been demonstrated by the isolation from the Drosophila genome project database of a novel class of seven-transmembrane proteins which were shown to be the elusive olfactory receptor genes of Drosophila.",2000,"J R Carlson, E N Moriyama, P J Clyne, J Kim, C G Warr"
Toward a physical map of Drosophila buzzatii. Use of randomly amplified polymorphic dna polymorphisms and sequence-tagged site landmarks,11102375,,"We present a physical map based on RAPD polymorphic fragments and sequence-tagged sites (STSs) for the repleta group species Drosophila buzzatii. One hundred forty-four RAPD markers have been used as probes for in situ hybridization to the polytene chromosomes, and positive results allowing the precise localization of 108 RAPDs were obtained. Of these, 73 behave as effectively unique markers for physical map construction, and in 9 additional cases the probes gave two hybridization signals, each on a different chromosome. Most markers (68%) are located on chromosomes 2 and 4, which partially agree with previous estimates on the distribution of genetic variation over chromosomes. One RAPD maps close to the proximal breakpoint of inversion 2z(3) but is not included within the inverted fragment. However, it was possible to conclude from this RAPD that the distal breakpoint of 2z(3) had previously been wrongly assigned. A total of 39 cytologically mapped RAPDs were converted to STSs and yielded an aggregate sequence of 28,431 bp. Thirty-six RAPDs (25%) did not produce any detectable hybridization signal, and we obtained the DNA sequence from three of them. Further prospects toward obtaining a more developed genetic map than the one currently available for D. buzzatii are discussed.",2000,"H Laayouni, M Santos, A Fontdevila"
Fruitless is in the regulatory pathway by which ectopic mini-white and transformer induce bisexual courtship in Drosophila,10858821,10.3109/01677060009084495,"Bisexual courtship in male Drosophila melanogaster may be induced in some circumstances. These include ectopic expression of the transformer (tra) gene, ectopic expression of the mini-white (mw) gene, and the homozygous presence of mutant alleles of the fruitless (fru) gene. Experiments were performed to determine if ectopic mw and fru, as well as ectopic tra and fru, acted in the same pathway to control courtship. Male flies homozygous for the frusat allele court females little if at all and males at a low level. When homozygous, the frusat allele suppresses the bisexual courtship induced by both ectopic mw and ectopic tra, indicating that the fru wild-type function is necessary for expression of the ectopic mw and ectopic tra effect. This demonstrates that fru shares a pathway controlling courtship behavior with these ectopically expressed genes.",2000,"W Awano, T Lukacsovich, D Yamamoto, K Usui-aoki, E E Nilsson, Z Asztalos"
Snail/slug family of repressors: slowly going into the fast lane of development and cancer,11054563,10.1016/s0378-1119(00)00371-1,"The existence of homologous genes in diverse species is intriguing. A detailed comparison of the structure and function of gene families may provide important insights into gene regulation and evolution. An unproven assumption is that homologous genes have a common ancestor. During evolution, the original function of the ancestral gene might be retained in the different species which evolved along separate courses. In addition, new functions could have developed as the sequence began to diverge. This may also explain partly the presence of multipurpose genes, which have multiple functions at different stages of development and in different tissues. The Drosophila gene snail is a multipurpose gene; it has been demonstrated that snail is critical for mesoderm formation, for CNS development, and for wing cell fate determination. The related vertebrate Snail and Slug genes have also been proposed to participate in mesoderm formation, neural crest cell migration, carcinogenesis, and apoptosis. In this review, we will discuss the Snail/Slug family of regulators in species ranging from insect to human. We will present the protein structures, expression patterns, and functions based on molecular genetic analyses. We will also include the studies that helped to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of repression and the relationship between the conserved and divergent functions of these genes. Moreover, the studies may enable us to trace the evolution of this gene family.",2000,"Y T Ip, K Hemavathy, S I Ashraf"
Cross-regulatory interactions among tracheal genes support a co-operative model for the induction of tracheal fates in the Drosophila embryo,10704851,10.1016/s0925-4773(99)00315-9,"The Drosophila tracheal system arises from clusters of ectodermal cells that invaginate and migrate to originate a network of epithelial tubes. Genetic analyses have identified several genes that are specifically expressed in the tracheal cells and are required for tracheal development. Among them, trachealess (trh) is able to induce ectopic tracheal pits and therefore it has been suggested that it would act as an inducer of tracheal cell fates; however, this capacity appears to be spatially restricted. Here we analyze the expression of the tracheal specific genes in the early steps of tracheal development and their cross-interactions. We find that there is a set of primary genes including trh and ventral veinless (vvl) whose expression does not depend on any other tracheal gene and a set of downstream genes whose expression requires different combinations of the primary genes. We also find that the combined expression of primary genes is sufficient to induce some downstream genes but not others. These results indicate that there is not a single master gene responsible for the appropriate expression of the tracheal genes and support a model where tracheal cell fates are induced by the co-operation of several factors rather than by the activity of a single tracheal inducer.",2000,"J Casanova, M Boube, M Llimargas"
Heterogeneity in Individual Mortality Risk and Its Importance for Evolutionary Studies of Senescence,10824017,10.1086/303371,"Mortality was simulated under the assumption of heterogeneity in individual age-specific mortality risk. Heterogeneity was modeled by assigning each individual its own Gompertz mortality function. Means and variances of the Gompertz intercept and slope parameters were based on published data for Drosophila melanogaster. Simulations of large cohorts reproduced mortality plateaus similar to those observed for actual cohorts of flies. Catastrophic late-age mortality was not observed except when heterogeneity was very low and rates of senescence were very high. A second set of simulations was designed to mimic experiments that have investigated age-specific patterns of genetic variance in mortality rates. Within-genotype heterogeneity in mortality risk resulted in a decline in genetic variance of mortality rates at old ages. That result suggests that the decline in genetic variance at old ages that has been observed in some experiments is an artifact of heterogeneity. Mortality rate plateaus, decrease in genetic variance of mortality rates at old ages, and absence of catastrophic late-age mortality all appear to contradict predictions of the evolutionary theory of senescence. Heterogeneity in mortality risk may explain those contradictions.",2000,Philip M Service
"Cloning and characterization of IAR1, a gene required for auxin conjugate sensitivity in Arabidopsis",11148286,10.1105/tpc.12.12.2395,"Most indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) in higher plants is conjugated to amino acids, sugars, or peptides, and these conjugates are implicated in regulating the concentration of the free hormone. We identified iar1 as an Arabidopsis mutant that is resistant to the inhibitory effects of several IAA-amino acid conjugates but remains sensitive to free IAA. iar1 partially suppresses phenotypes of a mutant that overproduces IAA, suggesting that IAR1 participates in auxin metabolism or response. We used positional information to clone IAR1, which encodes a novel protein with seven predicted transmembrane domains and several His-rich regions. IAR1 has homologs in other multicellular organisms, including Drosophila, nematodes, and mammals; in addition, the mouse homolog KE4 can functionally substitute for IAR1 in vivo. IAR1 also structurally resembles and has detectable sequence similarity to a family of metal transporters. We discuss several possible roles for IAR1 in auxin homeostasis.",2000,"D C Nelson, B Bartel, C Rongey, J Lasswell, L E Rogg"
DWnt-4 and Wingless have distinct activities in the Drosophila dorsal epidermis,11180811,10.1007/s004270050017,"Wnt genes are often expressed in overlapping patterns, where they affect a wide array of developmental processes. To address the way in which various Wnt signals elicit distinct effects we compared the activities of two Wnt genes in Drosophila, DWnt-4, and wingless. We show that these Wnt signals produce distinct responses in cells of the dorsal embryonic epidermis. Whereas wingless acts independently of hedgehog signaling in these cells, we show that DWnt-4 requires Hh to elicit its effects. We also show that expression of Wg signal transduction components does not mimic expression of DWnt-4, suggesting that DWnt-4 signaling proceeds through a distinct pathway. The dorsal epidermis may therefore be useful in the identification of novel Wnt signaling components.",2000,"E L Wilder, J Pradel, K Gieseler, S Anderson, M A Buratovich"
Dynamics of gene targeting and chromatin remodelling by nuclear receptors,10961929,,"Activation of the murine-mammary-tumour virus (MMTV) promoter by the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is associated with a chromatin structural transition in the B nucleosome region of the viral long terminal repeat (LTR). We have reconstituted this nucleoprotein transition with chromatin assembled on MMTV LTR DNA with Drosophila embryo extracts, purified GR, and HeLa nuclear extract. Chromatin remodelling in vitro is ATP-dependent and maps to a region identical with that found in vivo. We demonstrate specific, glucocorticoid response element dependent, binding of purified GR to a large, multi-nucleosome MMTV chromatin array and show that GR-dependent chromatin remodelling is a multistep process. In the absence of ATP, GR binds to multiple sites on the chromatin array and inhibits nuclease access to GR recognition sites. On the addition of ATP, GR induces remodelling resulting in a large increase in access of enzymes to their sites within the transition region. These findings are complemented by studies in living cells; using a tandem array of MMTV-Ras reporter elements and a form of GR labelled with the green fluorescent protein, we have observed direct targeting of the receptor to response elements in live mouse cells. Whereas the ligand-activated receptor is associated with the MMTV promoter for observable periods, photobleaching experiments provide direct evidence that the hormone-occupied receptor undergoes rapid exchange between chromatin and the nucleoplasmic compartment. The results both in vitro and in vivo are consistent with a dynamic model ('hit and run') in which GR first binds to chromatin after ligand activation, recruits a remodelling activity and is then lost from the template.",2000,"N Xiao, J G McNally, G L Hager, C T Baumann, T M Fletcher, W G Müller"
Platelet-derived growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor regulate cell proliferation and the expression of notch-1 receptor in a new oligodendrocyte cell line,11054800,10.1002/1097-4547(20001101)62:3<319::AID-JNR1>3.0.CO;2-G,"We generated a new cell line, N38, by conditionally immortalizing mouse oligodendrocytes (OLs) at early stages of maturation. The morphology and marker expression pattern suggest N38 cells are similar to immature OLs. N38 cells were sensitive to changes in serum concentrations, and forcing the cells to differentiate in low serum at 39 degrees C significantly decreased the survival of the cells. Importantly, addition of PDGFaa, bFGF or astrocyte-conditioned medium had protective effects on the cells, by increasing cell proliferation but not cell differentiation. This effect was receptor-mediated. Exposure of N38 cells to differentiating signals such as retinoic acid did not cause further differentiation of the cells. The N38 cell line expresses the vertebrate homolog of the Drosophila notch-1 receptor, a molecule that appears to regulate OL differentiation. Notch-1 receptor was homogeneously distributed in the somas of N38 cells. Incubation of N38 cells with either PDGFaa or bFGF, however, induced a polarized distribution of the receptor in the majority of the cells as well as an upregulation of receptor protein levels. The upregulation of molecules, such the notch-1 receptor, in pathways that control differentiation might be an important mechanism for keeping OL precursors in an undifferentiated state during their exit of the germinal layer and migration in the developing central nervous system. This OL cell line might constitute a suitable model for studies of regulatory mechanisms at this stage of OL differentiation.",2000,"S Byravan, E R Bongarzone, A T Campagnoni, M I Givogri, V Schonmann"
Nodulisporic acid opens insect glutamate-gated chloride channels: identification of a new high affinity modulator,10820028,10.1021/bi992943i,"Nodulisporic acid (NA) is an indole diterpene fungal product with insecticidal activity. NA activates a glutamate-gated chloride channel (GluCl) in grasshopper neurons and potentiates channel opening by glutamate. The endectocide ivermectin (IVM) induces a similar, but larger current than NA. Using Drosophila melanogaster head membranes, a high affinity binding site for NA was identified. Equilibrium binding studies show that an amide analogue, N-(2-hydroxyethyl-2,2-(3)H)nodulisporamide ([(3)H]NAmide), binds to a single population of sites in head membranes with a K(D) of 12 pM and a B(max) of 1.4 pmol/mg of protein. A similar K(D) is determined from the kinetics of ligand binding and dissociation. Four lines of evidence indicate that the binding site is a GluCl. First, NA potentiates opening of a glutamate-gated chloride current in grasshopper neurons. Second, glutamate inhibits the binding of [(3)H]NAmide by increasing the rate of dissociation 3-fold. Third, IVM potently inhibits the binding of [(3)H]NAmide and IVM binds to GluCls. Finally, the binding of [(3)H]IVM is inhibited by NA. The B(max) of [(3)H]IVM is twice that of [(3)H]NAmide, and about half of the [(3)H]IVM binding sites are inhibited by NA with high affinity (K(I) = 25 pM). In contrast, [(3)H]IVM binding to Caenorhabditis elegans membranes is not inhibited by NA at 100 nM, and there are no high affinity binding sites for NA on these membranes. Thus, half of the Drosophila IVM receptors and all of the NA receptors are associated with GluCl.

Drosophila dec-1 eggshell proteins are differentially distributed via a multistep extracellular processing and localization pathway,10985863,10.1006/dbio.2000.9805,"In Drosophila the multilayered eggshell forms during late oogenesis between the oocyte and the overlaying follicle cells. Proper eggshell assembly requires wild-type dec-1 gene function. Alternatively spliced dec-1 transcripts encode three proproteins that are cleaved extracellularly in a stage-specific manner to at least five distinct derivatives. Using polyclonal antibodies raised against fusion proteins containing different regions of the dec-1 proteins, we have localized several dec-1 derivatives in the assembling and completed eggshell. Although all of the dec-1 derivatives are generated in the oocyte proximal vitelline membrane layer, they are differentially distributed in the mature egg. Some derivatives are gradually released from the vitelline membrane and become localized within distinct regions of the chorion, while others are taken up by the oocyte or become concentrated in the endochorionic spaces or cavities. The diverse distributions of the dec-1 derivatives suggest that each derivative plays a distinct role in eggshell assembly. These results also suggest that the vitelline membrane layer, by acting as a transient storage site, may control the availability of molecules active in eggshell assembly and by extension perhaps other follicle cell products important in early embryonic pattern formation.",2000,"D Mauzy-Melitz, G L Waring, M I Noguerón"

Northern blot analyses showed a ubiquitously expressed RNA species of 8.5 kb. RNA in situ hybridization on brain sections of normal human embryos revealed a strong labeling in restricted areas of the cerebral cortex. In silico analysis of the deduced C21orf5 protein revealed several highly probable transmembrane segments but no known protein domains or homology with known proteins. However, there were significant homologies to several hypothetical Caenorhabditis elegans proteins and Drosophila melanogaster genomic sequences. To investigate the function of C21orf5, we isolated the cDNA of the C. elegans ortholog and performed double-stranded RNA-mediated genetic interference experiments. The major phenotype observed in the progeny of injected animals was embryonic lethality. Most of the tissues of the embryo failed to undergo proper patterning during gastrulation, and morphogenesis did not occur; thus we termed the ortholog pad-1, for patterning defective 1.

Comparative sequence analysis and patterns of covariation in RNA secondary structures,10655240,,"A novel method of RNA secondary structure prediction based on a comparison of nucleotide sequences is described. This method correctly predicts nearly all evolutionarily conserved secondary structures of five different RNAs: tRNA, 5S rRNA, bacterial ribonuclease P (RNase P) RNA, eukaryotic small subunit rRNA, and the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the Drosophila bicoid (bcd) mRNA. Furthermore, covariations occurring in the helices of these conserved RNA structures are analyzed. Two physical parameters are found to be important determinants of the evolution of compensatory mutations: the length of a helix and the distance between base-pairing nucleotides. For the helices of bcd 3' UTR mRNA and RNase P RNA, a positive correlation between the rate of compensatory evolution and helix length is found. The analysis of Drosophila bcd 3' UTR mRNA further revealed that the rate of compensatory evolution decreases with the physical distance between base-pairing residues. This result is in qualitative agreement with Kimura's model of compensatory fitness interactions, which assumes that mutations occurring in RNA helices are individually deleterious but become neutral in appropriate combinations.",2000,"J M Braverman, W Stephan, J Parsch"

The number of TPE repeats was studied in 101 current populations from around the world, and in 63 strains collected in the past. This revealed a geographical distribution which seems to have been stable since the beginning of the 1960s.

Response of Djun and Dfos mRNA abundance to signal transduction pathways in cultured cells of Drosophila melanogaster,10532309,10.1023/a:1006906419110,"The mammalian proto-oncogenes c-jun and c-fos are situated at the end of multiple signal transduction pathways and activation of their products Jun and Fos, components of the transcription factor AP-1, are able to regulate gene transcription in response to extracellular stimuli.

However, very little is known about how they are regulated through signal transduction pathways. This paper has investigated the response of their mRNA abundance levels to three signal transduction pathways in Drosophila cultured cells. Various agonists and antagonists that stimulate and inhibit specific enzymes in the pathways have been tested. The results suggest that Djun and Dfos mRNA are continuously expressed and their abundance levels are transiently regulated by multiple signaling pathways, the peak response coming at 1-2 hours after perturbation. Dfos is more highly regulated than Djun which is only modulated. The receptor tyrosine kinase pathways positively regulate Dfos and Djun.

The numbers and organization of GC elements vary in the four promoters, but the magnitude of activation by coexpressed human Sp1 was similar. A feature common to the four promoters is the presence of multiple, proximal Sp1-activating elements that account for 50% or more of the transcription activation by Sp1. The distribution and function of individual distal Sp1 elements is less defined and appear to be more promoter-specific. Finally, data from transfected Drosophila cells provide the first direct proof for the involvement of Sp1 in the negative regulation of the ANT2 promoter and as a possible participant in repression of the beta-subunit promoter.

Cellular mechanisms of wingless/Wnt signal transduction,9891886,10.1016/s0070-2153(08)60381-6,"Wg/Wnt signaling regulates cell proliferation and differentiation in species as divergent as nematodes, flies, frogs, and humans. Many components of this highly conserved process have been characterized and work from a number of laboratories is beginning to elucidate the mechanism by which this class of secreted growth factor triggers cellular decisions. The Wg/Wnt ligand apparently binds to Frizzled family receptor molecules to initiate a signal transduction cascade involving the novel cytosolic protein Dishevelled and the serine/threonine kinase Zeste-white 3/GSK3. Antagonism of Zw3 activity leads to stabilization of Armadillo/beta-catenin, which provides a transactivation domain when complexed with the HMG box transcription factor dTCF/LEF-1 and thereby activates expression of Wg/Wnt-responsive genes. The Wg/Wnt ligands pass through the secretory pathway and associate with extracellular matrix components; recent work shows that sulfated glycosaminoglycans are essential for proper transduction of the signal. Mutant forms of Wg in Drosophila reveal separable aspects of Wg function and suggest that proper transport of the protein across cells is essential for cell fate specification. Complex interactions with the Notch and EGF/Ras signaling pathways also play a role in cell fate decisions during different phases of Drosophila development.

Activity regulation of a Hox protein and a role for the homeodomain in inhibiting transcriptional activation,9878063,10.1093/emboj/18.1.198,"Hox proteins are transcription factors that assign positional identities along the body axis of animal embryos. Different Hox proteins have similar DNA-binding functions in vitro and require cofactors to achieve their biological functions. Cofactors can function by enhancement of the DNA-binding specificity of Hox proteins, as has been shown for Extradenticle (Exd). We present results supporting a novel mechanism for Hox cofactor function: regulation of transcriptional activation function. First, we provide evidence that the Hox protein Deformed (Dfd) can interact with simple DNA-binding sites in Drosophila embryos in the absence of Exd, but this binding is not sufficient for transcriptional activation of reporter genes. Secondly, either Dfd or a Dfd-VP16 hybrid mediate much stronger activation in embryos on a Dfd-Exd composite site than on a simple Dfd-binding site, even though the two sites possess similar Dfd-binding affinities. This suggests that Exd is required to release the transcriptional activation function of Dfd independently of Exd enhancement of Dfd-binding affinity on the composite site. Thirdly, transfection assays confirmed that Dfd possesses an activation domain, which is suppressed in a manner dependent on the presence of the homeodomain. The regulation of Hox transcriptional activation functions may underlie the different functional specificities of proteins belonging to this developmental patterning family.",1999,"X Li, W McGinnis, C Murre"
Localization of choline acetyltransferase-expressing neurons in Drosophila nervous system,10332725,10.1002/(SICI)1097-0029(19990415)45:2<65::AID-JEMT2>3.0.CO;2-0,"A variety of approaches have been developed to localize neurons and neural elements in nervous system tissues that make and use acetylcholine (ACh) as a neurotransmitter. Choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) is the enzyme catalyzing the biosynthesis of ACh and is considered to be an excellent phenotypic marker for cholinergic neurons. We have surveyed the distribution of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)-expressing neurons in the Drosophila nervous system detected by three different but complementary techniques. Immunocytochemistry, using anti-ChAT monoclonal antibodies results in identification of neuronal processes and a few types of cell somata that contain ChAT protein. In situ hybridization using cRNA probes to ChAT messenger RNA results in identification of cell bodies transcribing the ChAT gene. X-gal staining and/or beta-galactosidase immunocytochemistry of transformed animals carrying a fusion gene composed of the regulatory DNA from the ChAT gene controlling expression of a lacZ reporter has also been useful in identifying cholinergic neurons and neural elements. The combination of these three techniques has revealed that cholinergic neurons are widespread in both the peripheral and central nervous system of this model genetic organism at all but the earliest developmental stages. Expression of ChAT is detected in a variety of peripheral sensory neurons, and in the brain neurons associated with the visual and olfactory system, as well as in neurons with unknown functions in the cortices of brain and ganglia.",1999,"K Yasuyama, P M Salvaterra"

The role of human MBF1 as a transcriptional coactivator,10567391,10.1074/jbc.274.48.34196,"Multiprotein bridging factor 1 (MBF1) is a coactivator which mediates transcriptional activation by interconnecting the general transcription factor TATA element-binding protein and gene-specific activators such as the Drosophila nuclear receptor FTZ-F1 or the yeast basic leucine zipper protein GCN4. The human homolog of MBF1 (hMBF1) has been identified but its function, especially in transcription, remains unclear. Here we report the cDNA cloning and functional analysis of hMBF1. Two isoforms, which we term hMBF1alpha and hMBF1beta, have been identified. hMBF1alpha mRNA was detected in a number of tissues, whereas hMBF1beta exhibited tissue-specific expression. Both isoforms bound to TBP and Ad4BP/SF-1, a mammalian counterpart of FTZ-F1, and mediated Ad4BP/SF-1-dependent transcriptional activation. While hMBF1 was detected in the cytoplasm by immunostaining, coexpression of the nuclear protein Ad4BP/SF-1 with hMBF1 induced accumulation of hMBF1 in the nucleus, suggesting that hMBF1 is localized in the nucleus through its binding to Ad4BP/SF-1. hMBF1 also bound to ATF1, a member of the basic leucine zipper protein family, and mediated its activity as a transcriptional activator.

The effects of nutritional manipulation and laboratory selection on lifespan in Drosophila melanogaster,10361998,10.1093/gerona/54.5.b192,"There are parallels between the effects of laboratory selection and nutritional manipulation on the expression of lifespan and other fitness-related characters in Drosophila melanogaster. However, little is known about the effects of laboratory selection and nutritional manipulation when applied simultaneously. Given that D. melanogaster is one of the major model organisms for testing theories of aging, simultaneous application of laboratory selection and nutritional manipulation is of considerable interest. To that end we developed six groups of five fold replicated populations selected for either early or late fertility. Each of these groups was maintained on either high- or low-nutrition diets. Comparisons among the groups showed that nutrition is neutral in selecting for lifespan. Moreover, the dietary-restriction response can be broken by simultaneous selection and nutritional manipulation. Finally, characters that respond in a parallel manner under selection or nutritional manipulation may not when the two are applied simultaneously.",1999,"M R Rose, T J Nusbaum"
"Molecular evolution of a developmental pathway: phylogenetic analyses of transforming growth factor-beta family ligands, receptors and Smad signal transducers",10353918,,"Intercellular signaling by transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) proteins coordinates developmental decisions in many organisms. A receptor complex and Smad signal transducers are required for proper responses to TGF-beta signals. We have taken a phylogenetic approach to understanding the developmental evolutionary history of TGF-beta signaling pathways. We were interested in detecting evolutionary influences among the physically interacting multigene families encoding TGF-beta ligands, receptors, and Smads. Our analyses included new ligands and Smads identified from genomic sequence as well as the newest published family members. From an evolutionary perspective we find that (1) TGF-beta pathways do not predate the divergence of animals, plants, and fungi; (2) ligands of the TGF-beta/activin subfamily likely originated after the divergence of nematodes and arthropods; (3) type I receptors from Caenorhabditis elegans are distinct from other receptors and may reflect an ancestral transitional state between type I and type II receptors; and (4) the Smad family appears to be evolving faster than, and independently of, ligands and receptors. From a developmental perspective we find (1) numerous phylogenetic associations not previously detected in each multigene family; (2) that there are unidentified pathway components that discriminate between type I and type II receptors; (3) that there are more Smads to be discovered in Drosophila and mammals; and (4) that the number of C-terminal serines is the best predictor of a Smad's role in TGF-beta signal transduction.

We show here that the transcription factor LOLA is required for pathfinding and targeting of the SNb motor nerve in Drosophila. We also show that lola is a dose-dependent regulator of SNb development: by varying the expression of one lola isoform we can progressively titrate the extent of interaction of SNb motor axons with their target muscles, from no interaction at all, through wild-type patterning, to apparent hyperinnervation. The phenotypes we observe from altered expression of LOLA suggest that this protein may help orchestrate the coordinated expression of the genes required for faithful SNb development.",1999,"K Madden, D Crowner, E Giniger"
Co-adaptation of pheromone production and behavioural responses in Drosophila melanogaster males,10584557,10.1017/s0016672399003936,"In Drosophila melanogaster, male courtship behaviour is genetically controlled and is influenced by sex pheromones. 7-tricosene (7-T) induces a dose-dependent inhibition of male-male courtship, whereas 7,11-dienes stimulate male courtship of females. There is a geographical quantitative variation in the production of two predominant male hydrocarbons, 7-T and 7-pentacosene (7-P). We have previously found that 7-P, the main hydrocarbon from males of West African strains, stimulates males that mainly produce 7-T. Using both 'natural' and genetically engineered strains, we find that genetic factors coding for low levels of 7-P in males have co-evolved with factor(s) coding for male responses to high levels of 7-P. These two phenotypes are coded by factors on different chromosomes: the intraspecific polymorphism for the production of 7-T and 7-P is largely controlled by chromosome 2, whereas the variation in courtship towards 7-P-rich males is largely controlled by chromosome 3. The polymorphism of male courtship towards 7-P-rich males shows no correlation with the variation in male responses to female flies.",1999,"G Sureau, J F Ferveur"

A comparison of hybridization patterns in isogenic and original lines showed that isogenization in dysgenic crosses resulted in the appearance of additional hobo localization sites in LA but not in HA. The hobo destabilization in the LA genome correlated with genetic instability and the ability to induce H-E hybrid dysgenesis.

In order to analyze the Pax6 pathway in vertebrates we have isolated and characterized the cDNA and genomic clones corresponding to the human and mouse homologues of Drosophila dac. A full-length human cDNA encoding dachshund (DACH) encodes the 706 amino acids protein with predicted molecular weight of 73 kDa. A 109 amino acid domain located at the N-terminus of the DACH showed significant sequence and secondary structure homologies to the ski/sno oncogene products. Northern blot analysis found human DACH predominantly in adult kidney, heart, and placenta, with less expression detected in the brain, lung, skeletal muscle and pancreas. A panel of human cell lines was studied and most notably a large proportion of neuroblastomas expressed DACH mRNA. Mouse Dach encodes a protein of 751 amino acids with predicted molecular weight of 78 kDa that is 95% identical to the human DACH. RNase protection analysis showed the highest Dach mRNA expression in the adult mouse kidney and lung, whereas lower expression was detected in the brain and testis.

Southern blot analysis and sequencing of the regions surrounding the I-SceI sites revealed that in the majority of the cases, the introduction of DSBs at the I-SceI sites resulted in the complete deletion of the marker gene; the other events were associated with partial deletion of the marker gene.

Molecular evolution of the synapsin gene family,10578110,,"Synapsins, a family of synaptic vesicle proteins, play a crucial role in the regulation of neurotransmission and synaptogenesis.

Here, synapsins were cloned from three additional species: frog (Xenopus laevis), lamprey (Lampetra fluviatilis), and nematode (Caenorhabditis elegans). Synapsin protein sequences from all these species were then used to explore the molecular phylogeny of these important neuronal phosphoproteins. The ancestral condition of a single synapsin gene probably gave rise to the vertebrate synapsin gene family comprised of at least three synapsin genes (I, II, and III) in higher vertebrates. Synapsins possess multiple domains, which have evolved at different rates throughout evolution. In invertebrate synapsins, the most conserved domains are C and E. During the evolution of vertebrates, at least two gene duplication events are hypothesized to have given rise to the synapsin gene family.

Spatially regulated SpEts4 transcription factor activity along the sea urchin embryo animal-vegetal axis,10079234,,"Because the transcription of the SpHE gene is regulated cell-autonomously and asymmetrically along the maternally determined animal-vegetal axis of the very early sea urchin embryo, its regulators provide an excellent entry point for investigating the mechanism(s) that establishes this initial polarity. Previous studies support a model in which spatial regulation of SpHE transcription relies on multiple nonvegetal positive transcription factor activities (Wei, Z., Angerer, L. M. and Angerer, R. C. (1997) Dev. Biol. 187, 71-78) and a yeast one-hybrid screen has identified one, SpEts4, which binds with high specificity to a cis element in the SpHE regulatory region and confers positive activation of SpHE promoter transgenes (Wei, Z., Angerer, R. C. and Angerer, L. M. (1999) Mol. Cell. Biol. 19, 1271-1278). Here we demonstrate that SpEts4 can bind to the regulatory region of the endogenous SpHE gene because a dominant repressor, created by fusing SpEts4 DNA binding and Drosophila engrailed repression domains, suppresses its transcription. The pattern of expression of the SpEts4 gene is consistent with a role in regulating SpHE transcription in the nonvegetal region of the embryo during late cleavage/early blastula stages. Although maternal transcripts are uniformly distributed in the egg and early cleaving embryo, they rapidly turn over and are replaced by zygotic transcripts that accumulate in a pattern congruent with SpHE transcription. In addition, in vivo functional tests show that the SpEts4 cis element confers nonvegetal transcription of a beta-galactosidase reporter gene containing the SpHE basal promoter, and provide strong evidence that the activity of this transcription factor is an integral component of the nonvegetal transcriptional regulatory apparatus, which is proximal to, or part of, the mechanism that establishes the animal-vegetal axis of the sea urchin embryo.",1999,"Z Wei, L M Angerer, R C Angerer"

We have cloned Pabp2, the gene encoding the Drosophila homolog of mammalian PABP2, by using a molecular screen to identify new Drosophila proteins with RNP-type RNA-binding domains. Sequence comparison of PABP2 from Drosophila and mammals indicates that the most conserved domains are the RNA-binding domain and a coiled-coil like domain which could be involved in protein-protein interactions. Pabp2 produces four mRNAs which result from utilization of alternative poly(A) sites and encode the same protein. Using an antibody raised against Drosophila PABP2, we show that the protein accumulates in nuclei of all transcriptionally active cells throughout Drosophila development. This is consistent with a general role of PABP2 in mRNA polyadenylation. Analysis of Drosophila PABP2 function in a reconstituted mammalian polyadenylation system shows that the protein has the same functions as its bovine homolog in vitro : it stimulates poly(A) polymerase and is able to control poly(A) tail length.",1999,"N Aulner, B Benoit, M Simonelig, A Nemeth, U Kühn, H M Bourbon, E Wahle"
Filamin is required for ring canal assembly and actin organization during Drosophila oogenesis,10477759,10.1083/jcb.146.5.1061,"The remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton is essential for cell migration, cell division, and cell morphogenesis. Actin-binding proteins play a pivotal role in reorganizing the actin cytoskeleton in response to signals exchanged between cells. In consequence, actin-binding proteins are increasingly a focus of investigations into effectors of cell signaling and the coordination of cellular behaviors within developmental processes. One of the first actin-binding proteins identified was filamin, or actin-binding protein 280 (ABP280). Filamin is required for cell migration (Cunningham et al. 1992), and mutations in human alpha-filamin (FLN1; Fox et al. 1998) are responsible for impaired migration of cerebral neurons and give rise to periventricular heterotopia, a disorder that leads to epilepsy and vascular disorders, as well as embryonic lethality. We report the identification and characterization of a mutation in Drosophila filamin, the homologue of human alpha-filamin. During oogenesis, filamin is concentrated in the ring canal structures that fortify arrested cleavage furrows and establish cytoplasmic bridges between cells of the germline. The major structural features common to other filamins are conserved in Drosophila filamin. Mutations in Drosophila filamin disrupt actin filament organization and compromise membrane integrity during oocyte development, resulting in female sterility.

In agreement with the n-octanol/saline partition ratios, intracellular platinum content (and DNA platination) after a 2-h exposure to equimolar drug concentrations was in the order 1 > 2 >> cisplatin, thus indicating that substitution of imminoethers for ammines determines a major lipophilicity and cellular uptake of the platinum drug. Both 1 and 2 showed a major toxic effect towards an excision repair-defective Drosophila strain, thus indicating cellular DNA as cytotoxic target. Finally, both 1 and 2 were active in vivo against the murine P388 system, but, contrary to the in vitro activity, isomer 2 was slightly more active than 1.

We have analyzed 2085 coding nucleotides from the xanthine dehydrogenase (Xdh) gene in six species, at least one from each subgroup. We follow a model-based maximum likelihood framework. We first model the substitution process using a tree topology that is approximately accurate. Then we evaluate several candidate tree topologies using a working model of nucleotide substitution. We found that a minimally realistic description of the substitution process along the Xdh region should allow two transition and four transversion rate parameters and different fixed rates for codon positions, which are distributed statistically according to different gamma distributions. The phylogeny obtained using this description differs in significant respects from a phylogeny based on anatomical criteria. We have also analyzed data from five additional (three nuclear and two mitochondrial) gene regions. In our analysis, these relatively short DNA sequences, either separately or jointly, fail to discriminate statistically among alternative phylogenies. When the data for these five gene regions are combined with the Xdh sequences, the strong phylogenetic signal emerging from Xdh becomes somewhat diluted rather than reinforced.

Loss of axonal mitochondria promotes tau-mediated neurodegeneration and Alzheimer's disease-related tau phosphorylation via PAR-1,22952452,10.1371/journal.pgen.1002918,"Abnormal phosphorylation and toxicity of a microtubule-associated protein tau are involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, what pathological conditions trigger tau abnormality in AD is not fully understood. A reduction in the number of mitochondria in the axon has been implicated in AD. In this study, we investigated whether and how loss of axonal mitochondria promotes tau phosphorylation and toxicity in vivo. Using transgenic Drosophila expressing human tau, we found that RNAi-mediated knockdown of milton or Miro, an adaptor protein essential for axonal transport of mitochondria, enhanced human tau-induced neurodegeneration. Tau phosphorylation at an AD-related site Ser262 increased with knockdown of milton or Miro; and partitioning defective-1 (PAR-1), the Drosophila homolog of mammalian microtubule affinity-regulating kinase, mediated this increase of tau phosphorylation. Tau phosphorylation at Ser262 has been reported to promote tau detachment from microtubules, and we found that the levels of microtubule-unbound free tau increased by milton knockdown. Blocking tau phosphorylation at Ser262 site by PAR-1 knockdown or by mutating the Ser262 site to unphosphorylatable alanine suppressed the enhancement of tau-induced neurodegeneration caused by milton knockdown. Furthermore, knockdown of milton or Miro increased the levels of active PAR-1. These results suggest that an increase in tau phosphorylation at Ser262 through PAR-1 contributes to tau-mediated neurodegeneration under a pathological condition in which axonal mitochondria is depleted. Intriguingly, we found that knockdown of milton or Miro alone caused late-onset neurodegeneration in the fly brain, and this neurodegeneration could be suppressed by knockdown of Drosophila tau or PAR-1. Our results suggest that loss of axonal mitochondria may play an important role in tau phosphorylation and toxicity in the pathogenesis of AD.",2012,"Kanae Iijima-Ando, Koichi M Iijima, Akiko Maruko-Otake, Bingwei Lu, Yosuke Ohtake, Michiko Sekiya, Emiko Suzuki"
Neuropeptide delivery to synapses by long-range vesicle circulation and sporadic capture,22385966,10.1016/j.cell.2011.12.036,"Neurotransmission requires anterograde axonal transport of dense core vesicles (DCVs) containing neuropeptides and active zone components from the soma to nerve terminals.

Here, Drosophila neuropeptide-containing DCVs are tracked in vivo for minutes with a new method called simultaneous photobleaching and imaging (SPAIM). Surprisingly, anterograde DCVs typically bypass proximal boutons to accumulate initially in the most distal bouton. Then, excess distal DCVs undergo dynactin-dependent retrograde transport back through proximal boutons into the axon. Just before re-entering the soma, DCVs again reverse for another round of anterograde axonal transport. While circulating over long distances, both anterograde and retrograde DCVs are captured sporadically in en passant boutons. Therefore, vesicle circulation, which includes long-range retrograde transport and inefficient bidirectional capture, overcomes the limitations of one-way anterograde transport to uniformly supply release sites with DCVs.",2012,"David L Deitcher, Dinara Shakiryanova, Chaoming Zhou, Thomas E Lloyd, Man Yan Wong, Edwin S Levitan"
Role of NPxY motif in Draper-mediated apoptotic cell clearance in Drosophila,23337816,,"Draper, a receptor responsible for the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells in Drosophila, possesses atypical epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like sequences in the extracellular region and the two phosphorylatable motifs NPxY and YxxL in the intracellular portion. We previously suggested that Pretaporter, a ligand for Draper, binds to the EGF-like repeat and augments the tyrosine phosphorylation of Draper. In this study, we first tested the binding of Pretaporter to various parts of the extracellular region of Draper and found that a single EGF-like sequence is sufficient for the binding. We next determined roles of the two intracellular motifs by forcedly expressing Draper proteins, in which tyrosine residues within the motifs had been substituted with phenylalanine, in hemocytes of Draper-lacking flies. We found that Draper proteins with Y-to-F substitution in either motif still underwent tyrosine phosphorylation, suggesting the occurrence of phosphorylation at both motifs. The Draper protein with substitution in the YxxL motif rescued a defect of phagocytosis, as did intact Draper, but the Draper protein with substitution in the NPxY motif did not, indicating a role of the motif NPxY, but not YxxL, in Draper-mediated phagocytosis. This coincides with our previous finding that Ced-6, an NPxY-binding signaling adaptor, is required for Draper's actions in apoptotic cell clearance. In summary, we demonstrated that Draper binds to its ligand Pretaporter using EGF-like sequences, and that the NPxY motif in the intracellular region of Draper plays an essential role in its actions as an engulfment receptor.",2012,"Akiko Shiratsuchi, Kaz Nagaosa, Yu Fujita, Yoshinobu Nakanishi"
"A screen for round egg mutants in Drosophila identifies tricornered, furry, and misshapen as regulators of egg chamber elongation",22413091,10.1534/g3.111.001677,"The elongation of tissues and organs during embryonic development results from the coordinate polarization of cell behaviors with respect to the elongation axis. Within the Drosophila melanogaster ovary, initially spherical egg chambers lengthen dramatically as they develop to create the elliptical shape of the mature egg. This morphogenesis depends on an unusual form of planar polarity within the egg chamber's outer epithelial cell layer known as the follicle cells. Disruption of follicle cell planar polarity leads to the production of round rather than elongated eggs; however, the molecular mechanisms that control this tissue organization are poorly understood. Starting from a broadly based forward genetic screen, we have isolated 12 new round egg complementation groups, and have identified four of the mutated genes. In mapping the largest complementation group to the fat2 locus, we unexpectedly discovered a high incidence of cryptic fat2 mutations in the backgrounds of publicly available stocks. Three other complementation groups correspond to the genes encoding the cytoplasmic signaling proteins Tricornered (Trc), Furry (Fry), and Misshapen (Msn). Trc and Fry are known members of an NDR kinase signaling pathway, and as a Ste20-like kinase, Msn may function upstream of Trc. We show that all three proteins are required for follicle cell planar polarity at early stages of egg chamber elongation and that Trc shows a planar polarized distribution at the basal follicle cell surface. These results indicate that this new mutant collection is likely to provide novel insight into the molecular mechanisms controlling follicle cell planar polarity and egg chamber elongation.",2012,"William Menegas, Gary Gerlach 2nd, David Bilder, Joseph Hill, Sally Horne-Badovinac"
General survey of hAT transposon superfamily with highlight on hobo element in Drosophila,23111927,10.1007/s10709-012-9687-0,"The hAT transposons, very abundant in all kingdoms, have a common evolutionary origin probably predating the plant-fungi-animal divergence.

Members of this superfamily belong to Class II transposable elements. hAT elements share transposase, short terminal inverted repeats and eight base-pairs duplication of genomic target. We focus on hAT elements in Drosophila, especially hobo. Its distribution, dynamics and impact on genome restructuring in laboratory strains as well as in natural populations are reported.

The role of Bicoid cooperative binding in the patterning of sharp borders in Drosophila melanogaster,22841642,10.1016/j.ydbio.2012.07.020,"In Drosophila embryonic development, the Bicoid (Bcd) protein establishes positional information of downstream developmental genes like hunchback (hb), which has a strong anterior expression and a sharp on-off boundary in the mid-embryo. The role of Bcd cooperative binding in the positioning of the Hb pattern has been previously demonstrated. However, there are discrepancies in the reported results about the role of this mechanism in the sharp Hb border. Here, we determined the Hill coefficient (nH) required for Bcd to generate the sharp border of Hb in wild-type (WT) embryos. We found that an n(H) of approximately 6.3 (s.d. 1.4) and 10.8 (s.d. 4.0) is required to account for Hb sharpness at early and late cycle 14A, respectively. Additional mechanisms are possibly required because the high nH is likely unachievable for Bcd binding to the hb promoter. To test this idea, we determined the nH required to pattern the Hb profile of 15 embryos expressing an hb14F allele that is defective in self-activation and found nH to be 3.0 (s.d. 1.0). This result indicates that in WT embryos, the hb self-activation is important for Hb sharpness. Corroborating our results, we also found a progressive increase in the required value of n(H) spanning from 4.0 to 9.2 by determining this coefficient from averaged profiles of eight temporal classes at cycle 14A (T1 to T8). Our results indicate that there is a transition in the mechanisms responsible for the sharp Hb border during cycle 14A: in early stages of this cycle, Bcd cooperative binding is primarily responsible for Hb sharpness; in late cycle 14A, hb self-activation becomes the dominant mechanism.",2012,"Paulo M Bisch, Francisco J P Lopes, Alexander V Spirov"
"Constant, cycling, hot and cold thermal environments: strong effects on mean viability but not on genetic estimates",22515705,10.1111/j.1420-9101.2012.02513.x,"It has frequently been suggested that trait heritabilities are environmentally sensitive, and there are genetic trade-offs between tolerating different environments such as hot and cold or constant and fluctuating temperatures. Future climate predictions suggest an increase in both temperatures and their fluctuations. How species will respond to these changes is uncertain, particularly as there is a lack of studies which compare genetic performances in constant vs. fluctuating environments. In this study, we used a nested full-sib/half-sib breeding design to examine how the genetic variances and heritabilities of egg-to-adult viability differ at high and low temperatures with and without daily fluctuations in temperatures using Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism. Although egg-to-adult viability was clearly sensitive to developmental temperatures, heritabilities were not particularly sensitive to developmental temperatures. Moreover, we found that egg-to-adult viabilities at different developmental temperatures were positively correlated, suggesting a common genetic background for egg-to-adult viability at different temperatures. Finding both a uniform genetic background coupled with rather low heritabilities insensitive to temperatures, our results suggest evolutionary responses are unlikely to be limited by temperature effects on genetic parameters or negative genetic correlations, but by the direct effects of stressful temperatures on egg-to-adult viability accompanied with low heritabilities.",2012,"V Kellermann, T N Kristensen, V Loeschcke, T Ketola"
Conserved gene order at the nuclear periphery in Drosophila,21771720,10.1093/molbev/msr178,"Whether higher-order chromatin organization is related to genome stability over evolutionary time remains elusive. We find that regions of conserved gene order across the genus Drosophila are larger if they harbor genes bound by B-type lamin (Lam) and Suppressor of Under-Replication (SUUR), two proteins located at the nuclear periphery. Low recombination rates and coexpression of genes in regions of conserved gene order do not explain the lower probability of disruption in these regions by genome rearrangements. Instead, we find a significant colocalization between evolutionarily stable genomic regions associated with Lam and sequences thought to regulate local gene expression, which have the potential to impose constraints on genome rearrangement. At least in the genus Drosophila, localization of particular genomic regions at the nuclear periphery is intimately associated with their long-term integrity during evolution.",2012,"Carlos Díaz-Castillo, Rita Petersen, José M Ranz"
"Chloride intracellular channels modulate acute ethanol behaviors in Drosophila, Caenorhabditis elegans and mice",22239914,10.1111/j.1601-183X.2012.00765.x,"Identifying genes that influence behavioral responses to alcohol is critical for understanding the molecular basis of alcoholism and ultimately developing therapeutic interventions for the disease. Using an integrated approach that combined the power of the Drosophila, Caenorhabditis elegans and mouse model systems with bioinformatics analyses, we established a novel, conserved role for chloride intracellular channels (CLICs) in alcohol-related behavior. CLIC proteins might have several biochemical functions including intracellular chloride channel activity, modulation of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β signaling, and regulation of ryanodine receptors and A-kinase anchoring proteins. We initially identified vertebrate Clic4 as a candidate ethanol-responsive gene via bioinformatic analysis of data from published microarray studies of mouse and human ethanol-related genes. We confirmed that Clic4 expression was increased by ethanol treatment in mouse prefrontal cortex and also uncovered a correlation between basal expression of Clic4 in prefrontal cortex and the locomotor activating and sedating properties of ethanol across the BXD mouse genetic reference panel. Furthermore, we found that disruption of the sole Clic Drosophila orthologue significantly blunted sensitivity to alcohol in flies, that mutations in two C. elegans Clic orthologues, exc-4 and exl-1, altered behavioral responses to acute ethanol in worms and that viral-mediated overexpression of Clic4 in mouse brain decreased the sedating properties of ethanol. Together, our studies demonstrate key roles for Clic genes in behavioral responses to acute alcohol in Drosophila, C. elegans and mice.",2012,"I Martin, M Grotewiel, J S Hill, C-L Chan, J C Bettinger, S P Farris, A G Davies, P Bhandari, M F Miles, J T Alaimo, B Costin"
Flying Drosophila orient to sky polarization,22177905,10.1016/j.cub.2011.11.026,"Insects maintain a constant bearing across a wide range of spatial scales. Monarch butterflies and locusts traverse continents [1, 2], and foraging bees and ants travel hundreds of meters to return to their nests [1, 3, 4], whereas many other insects fly straight for only a few centimeters before changing direction. Despite this variation in spatial scale, the brain region thought to underlie long-distance navigation is remarkably conserved [5, 6], suggesting that the use of a celestial compass is a general and perhaps ancient capability of insects. Laboratory studies of Drosophila have identified a local search mode in which short, straight segments are interspersed with rapid turns [7, 8]. However, this flight mode is inconsistent with measured gene flow between geographically separated populations [9-11], and individual Drosophila can travel 10 km across desert terrain in a single night [9, 12, 13]-a feat that would be impossible without prolonged periods of straight flight. To directly examine orientation behavior under outdoor conditions, we built a portable flight arena in which a fly viewed the natural sky through a liquid crystal device that could experimentally rotate the polarization angle. Our findings indicate that Drosophila actively orient using the sky's natural polarization pattern.",2012,"Michael H Dickinson, Peter T Weir"
Widespread polymorphism in the positions of stop codons in Drosophila melanogaster,22051795,10.1093/gbe/evr113,"The mechanisms underlying evolutionary changes in protein length are poorly understood. Protein domains are lost and gained between species and must have arisen first as within-species polymorphisms. Here, we use Drosophila melanogaster population genomic data combined with between species divergence information to understand the evolutionary forces that generate and maintain polymorphisms causing changes in protein length in D. melanogaster. Specifically, we looked for protein length variations resulting from premature termination codons (PTCs) and stop codon losses (SCLs). We discovered that 438 genes contained polymorphisms resulting in truncation of the translated region (PTCs) and 119 genes contained polymorphisms predicted to lengthen the translated region (SCLs). Stop codon polymorphisms (SCPs) (especially PTCs) appear to be more deleterious than other polymorphisms, including protein amino acid changes. Genes harboring SCPs are in general less selectively constrained, more narrowly expressed, and enriched for dispensable biological functions. However, we also observed exceptional cases such as genes that have multiple independent SCPs, alleles that are shared between D. melanogaster and Drosophila simulans, and high-frequency alleles that cause extreme changes in gene length. SCPs likely have an important role in the evolution of these genes.",2012,"Yuh Chwen G Lee, Josephine A Reinhardt"
Hydroxyurea ablation of mushroom bodies in Drosophila,22301647,10.1101/pdb.prot067777,"Chemical ablation is an effective tool for studying nervous system development and function in Drosophila. Hydroxyurea (HU) inhibits ribonucleotide reductase, blocking DNA synthesis, and killing dividing cells. The specificity of HU ablation is thus dependent on developmental events. In this respect, HU is useful in determining temporal patterns of neuroblast proliferation and the origins of neuronal elements in flies and other insects. In Drosophila, an especially fortuitous time window occurs at the end of embryonic development. For the first 8-12 h after larval hatching, only five neuroblasts are proliferating in each brain hemisphere. Four of these are found in the dorsal protocerebrum and give rise to the intrinsic elements (Kenyon cells [KCs] and glia) of the mushroom bodies (MBs). The remaining single neuroblast has an anterolateral position in the brain and is the progenitor of local interneurons (LocI) in the antennal lobe (AL) and a subset of lateral relay interneurons (RIl) in the inner antennocerebral tract (iACT). Treating newly hatched larvae with HU results in adult flies with KCs and AL interneurons of embryonic origin only.

"Methamphetamine causes anorexia in Drosophila melanogaster, exhausting metabolic reserves and contributing to mortality",22863857,10.2131/jts.37.773,"Methamphetamine (MA) appears to produce neurotoxic effects, in part, through disruptions of energy metabolism. A recent study of the whole-body proteome of Drosophila melanogaster showed many changes in energy metabolism-related proteins, leading us to hypothesize that MA toxicity may cause whole-body disruptions of energy metabolism. To test this, we monitored the response of energy reserves and other metabolites to MA-exposure with and without the addition of dietary glucose. We also monitored changes in feeding behavior, locomotor activity and respiration rates associated with MA-exposure to investigate how MA affects energy balance. We observed that glycogen and triglyceride levels decreased dramatically within 48 hr of MA-exposure, indicating a strongly negative caloric balance. Behavioral assays revealed that MA-treated flies decreased food consumption by 60-80% and exhibited a 2-fold increase in locomotion. Caloric expenditure decreased with MA-exposure, apparently due to a compensatory decrease in resting metabolism, showing that anorexia was the primary driver of the negative caloric balance. Additionally, we observed that glucose supplementation of MA-containing diet increased glycogen reserves by 44% at 48 hr, leading to a commensurate increase in survivorship. We conclude that dietary sugar supplementation enhances survivorship by partially compensating for decreased caloric intake resulting from MA-induced anorexia. The observation that MA produces similar behavioral changes in Drosophila and humans, i.e. increased locomotor activity and anorexia, further supports the use of Drosophila as a model organism for the study of the effects of MA.",2012,"R J Cody Markelz, Kent R Walters Jr, William M Muir, Barry R Pittendrigh, S Indu Rupassara, Andrew D B Leakey"
The small G protein Arl1 directs the trans-Golgi-specific targeting of the Arf1 exchange factors BIG1 and BIG2,22291037,10.1083/jcb.201107115,"The small G protein Arf1 regulates Golgi traffic and is activated by two related types of guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF). GBF1 acts at the cis-Golgi, whereas BIG1 and its close paralog BIG2 act at the trans-Golgi. Peripheral membrane proteins such as these GEFs are often recruited to membranes by small G proteins, but the basis for specific recruitment of Arf GEFs, and hence Arfs, to Golgi membranes is not understood. In this paper, we report a liposome-based affinity purification method to identify effectors for small G proteins of the Arf family. We validate this with the Drosophila melanogaster Arf1 orthologue (Arf79F) and the related class II Arf (Arf102F), which showed a similar pattern of effector binding. Applying the method to the Arf-like G protein Arl1, we found that it binds directly to Sec71, the Drosophila ortholog of BIG1 and BIG2, via an N-terminal region. We show that in mammalian cells, Arl1 is necessary for Golgi recruitment of BIG1 and BIG2 but not GBF1. Thus, Arl1 acts to direct a trans-Golgi-specific Arf1 GEF, and hence active Arf1, to the trans side of the Golgi.",2012,"Chantal Christis, Sean Munro"

Multiple members of the UDP-GalNAc: polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase family are essential for viability in Drosophila,22157008,10.1074/jbc.M111.306159,"Mucin-type O-glycosylation represents a major form of post-translational modification that is conserved across most eukaryotic species. This type of glycosylation is initiated by a family of enzymes (GalNAc-Ts in mammals and PGANTs in Drosophila) whose members are expressed in distinct spatial and temporal patterns during development. Previous work from our group demonstrated that one member of this family is essential for viability and another member modulates extracellular matrix composition and integrin-mediated cell adhesion during development. To investigate whether other members of this family are essential, we employed RNA interference (RNAi) to each gene in vivo. Using this approach, we identified 4 additional pgant genes that are required for viability. Ubiquitous RNAi to pgant4, pgant5, pgant7, or the putative glycosyltransferase CG30463 resulted in lethality. Tissue-specific RNAi was also used to define the specific organ systems and tissues in which each essential family member is required. Interestingly, each essential pgant had a unique complement of tissues in which it was required. Additionally, certain tissues (mesoderm, digestive system, and tracheal system) required more than one pgant, suggesting unique functions for specific enzymes in these tissues. Expanding upon our RNAi results, we found that conventional mutations in pgant5 resulted in lethality and specific defects in specialized cells of the digestive tract, resulting in loss of proper digestive system acidification. In summary, our results highlight essential roles for O-glycosylation and specific members of the pgant family in many aspects of development and organogenesis.",2012,"Duy T Tran, E Tian, Lesley A Earl, Liping Zhang, Kelly G Ten Hagen, Ying Zhang"

We found that for most genes showing changes in expression associated with inbreeding, the least depressed sublines were those showing the largest departures in expression from that of the outbred control. This suggests a pattern consistent with a protective role of expression changes against inbreeding effects, and would reveal a new dimension of the transcriptomics of inbreeding. The variation in depression observed could then be due not only to the genetic damages primarily originating that depression, but also possibly to differences in the ability to carry out the appropriate adjustments in gene expression to cope with the inbreeding.

Ha44 demonstrated significant activity against embryos and was capable of arresting development at a number of stages of embryogenesis. The effects of Ha44 on embryos was shown to be reversible following the addition of the metal ions Fe(II) and Fe(III), Cu and Zn. When larvae were exposed to Ha44, lethality was recorded at similar concentrations to those observed for embryos. Using an eYFP reporter system it was shown that Ha44 was able to reduce the levels of both copper and zinc in the digestive tract, confirming the binding of Ha44 to these metals in vivo. Ha44 has further been shown to inhibit a zinc containing metalloproteinase in vitro. Exposure of adult flies to Ha44 resulted in lethality, but at higher concentrations than those observed for embryos and larvae. The median lethal dose in adult flies was shown to be associated with the type of exposure, with an LD-50 of 1.57 mM being recorded following the direct contact of flies with Ha44, while an LD-50 of 12.29 mM was recorded following the ingestion of the compound.

JNK pathway activation is controlled by Tao/TAOK3 to modulate ethanol sensitivity,23227189,10.1371/journal.pone.0050594,"Neuronal signal transduction by the JNK MAP kinase pathway is altered by a broad array of stimuli including exposure to the widely abused drug ethanol, but the behavioral relevance and the regulation of JNK signaling is unclear. Here we demonstrate that JNK signaling functions downstream of the Sterile20 kinase family gene tao/Taok3 to regulate the behavioral effects of acute ethanol exposure in both the fruit fly Drosophila and mice. In flies tao is required in neurons to promote sensitivity to the locomotor stimulant effects of acute ethanol exposure and to establish specific brain structures. Reduced expression of key JNK pathway genes substantially rescued the structural and behavioral phenotypes of tao mutants. Decreasing and increasing JNK pathway activity resulted in increased and decreased sensitivity to the locomotor stimulant properties of acute ethanol exposure, respectively. Further, JNK expression in a limited pattern of neurons that included brain regions implicated in ethanol responses was sufficient to restore normal behavior. Mice heterozygous for a disrupted allele of the homologous Taok3 gene (Taok3Gt) were resistant to the acute sedative effects of ethanol. JNK activity was constitutively increased in brains of Taok3Gt/+ mice, and acute induction of phospho-JNK in brain tissue by ethanol was occluded in Taok3Gt/+ mice. Finally, acute administration of a JNK inhibitor conferred resistance to the sedative effects of ethanol in wild-type but not Taok3Gt/+ mice. Taken together, these data support a role of a TAO/TAOK3-JNK neuronal signaling pathway in regulating sensitivity to acute ethanol exposure in flies and in mice.",2012,"Ulrike Heberlein, Ian King, Fred W Wolf, Jana P Lim, David Kapfhamer, Mimi E Zou"

The significance of our study is to document the first direct evidence for the accumulation of age-related DNA-damage in ISCs, and to show γH2AvD as a useful biomarker in exploring the molecular mechanisms underlying stem cell aging in the Drosophila midgut.",2012,"Hyun-Jin Na, Young-Shin Kim, Mi-Ae Yoo, Jung-Hoon Pyo, Shin-Hae Lee, Joung-Sun Park"
Fine-scale mapping of natural variation in fly fecundity identifies neuronal domain of expression and function of an aquaporin,22509142,10.1371/journal.pgen.1002631,"To gain insight into the molecular genetic basis of standing variation in fitness related traits, we identify a novel factor that regulates the molecular and physiological basis of natural variation in female Drosophila melanogaster fecundity. Genetic variation in female fecundity in flies derived from a wild orchard population is heritable and largely independent of other measured life history traits. We map a portion of this variation to a single QTL and then use deficiency mapping to further refine this QTL to 5 candidate genes. Ubiquitous expression of RNAi against only one of these genes, an aquaporin encoded by Drip, reduces fecundity. Within our mapping population Drip mRNA level in the head, but not other tissues, is positively correlated with fecundity. We localize Drip expression to a small population of corazonin producing neurons located in the dorsolateral posterior compartments of the protocerebrum. Expression of Drip-RNAi using both the pan-neuronal ELAV-Gal4 and the Crz-Gal4 drivers reduces fecundity. Low-fecundity RILs have decreased Crz expression and increased expression of pale, the enzyme encoding the rate-limiting step in the production of dopamine, a modulator of insect life histories. Taken together these data suggest that natural variation in Drip expression in the corazonin producing neurons contributes to standing variation in fitness by altering the concentration of two neurohormones.",2012,"Young-Joon Kim, Alan O Bergland, Hyo-seok Chae, Marc Tatar"
Optimization of a GCaMP calcium indicator for neural activity imaging,23035093,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2601-12.2012,"Genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) are powerful tools for systems neuroscience. Recent efforts in protein engineering have significantly increased the performance of GECIs. The state-of-the art single-wavelength GECI, GCaMP3, has been deployed in a number of model organisms and can reliably detect three or more action potentials in short bursts in several systems in vivo. Through protein structure determination, targeted mutagenesis, high-throughput screening, and a battery of in vitro assays, we have increased the dynamic range of GCaMP3 by severalfold, creating a family of ""GCaMP5"" sensors. We tested GCaMP5s in several systems: cultured neurons and astrocytes, mouse retina, and in vivo in Caenorhabditis chemosensory neurons, Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction and adult antennal lobe, zebrafish retina and tectum, and mouse visual cortex. Signal-to-noise ratio was improved by at least 2- to 3-fold. In the visual cortex, two GCaMP5 variants detected twice as many visual stimulus-responsive cells as GCaMP3. By combining in vivo imaging with electrophysiology we show that GCaMP5 fluorescence provides a more reliable measure of neuronal activity than its predecessor GCaMP3. GCaMP5 allows more sensitive detection of neural activity in vivo and may find widespread applications for cellular imaging in general.",2012,"Xiaonan Richard Sun, Nicole Carreras Calderón, Trevor J Wardill, Eric R Schreiter, Cornelia I Bargmann, Ryousuke Takagi, Vivek Jayaraman, Lin Tian, Sebastian Kracun, Michael B Orger, John J Macklin, Leon Lagnado, Sevinç Mutlu, Ruben Portugues, Herwig Baier, Samuel S-H Wang, Loren L Looger, Aman Aggarwal, Douglas S Kim, Eiji Shigetomi, Andrew Gordus, Bruce E Kimmel, Jonathan S Marvin, Federico Esposti, Tsai-Wen Chen, Rex A Kerr, Karel Svoboda, Baljit S Khakh, Bart G Borghuis, Jasper Akerboom, Florian Engert, Alessandro Filosa"
"Analysis of expressed sequence tags and characterization of a novel gene, Slmg7, in the midgut of the common cutworm, Spodoptera litura",22470457,10.1371/journal.pone.0033621,"Background: Out of total 3,081 assembled expressed sequence tags (ESTs) sequences representing 6,815 high-quality ESTs identified in three cDNA libraries constructed with RNA isolated from the midgut of Spodoptera litura, 1,039 ESTs showed significant hits and 1,107 ESTs did not show significant hits in BLAST searches. It is of interest to clarify whether or not these ESTs that did not show hits function in S. Litura. Results: Twenty ""no-hit"" ESTs containing at least one putative open reading frame were selected for further expression analysis. The results from northern blot analysis showed that six of the selected ESTs are expressed in the larval midgut of this insect at different levels, suggesting that these ESTs represent true mRNA products, whereas the other 14 ESTs could not be detected. Homologues of the four larval midgut-predominant genes (Slmg2, Slmg7, Slmg9 and Slmg17) were detected in the genomes of other lepidopteran insects but not in Drosophila melanogaster. A novel gene, Slmg7, is expressed at a high level specifically in the midgut during each of the larval stages. Slmg7 is a single copy gene and encodes a 143-amino acids protein. The SLMG7 protein was localized to the cytoplasm of Spli-221 cells. Conclusions: Six ESTs from the no hit list are transcribed into mRNA and are mainly expressed in the midgut of S. litura.

RNAi related mechanisms affect both transcriptional and posttranscriptional transgene silencing in Drosophila,11864605,10.1016/s1097-2765(02)00440-9,"Two types of transgene silencing were found for the Alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) transcription unit. Transcriptional gene silencing (TGS) is Polycomb dependent and occurs when Adh is driven by the white eye color gene promoter. Full-length Adh transgenes are silenced posttranscriptionally at high copy number or by a pulsed increase over a threshold. The posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS) exhibits molecular hallmarks typical of RNA interference (RNAi), including the production of 21--25 bp length sense and antisense RNAs homologous to the silenced RNA.

The ATOH7 coding region is contained within a single exon. We mapped ATOH7 to Chromosome (Chr) 10q21.3-22.1, a region syntenic to the segment of mouse Chr 10 where Atoh7 (formerly Math5) is located. The evolutionary relationship between ATOH7 and other atonal homologs was investigated using parsimony analysis. A direct comparison of ATH5/7 and ATH1 protein subgroups to Atonal also revealed a nonrandom distribution of amino acid changes across the bHLH domain, which may be related to their separate visual and proprioceptive sensory functions. Among bHLH genes, ATOH7 is most closely related to Atoh7. This sequence conservation extends significantly beyond the coding region. We define blocks of strong homology in flanking human and mouse genomic DNA, which are likely to include cis regulatory elements. Because targeted deletion of Atoh7 causes optic nerve agenesis in mice, we propose ATOH7 as a candidate for human optic nerve aplasia and related clinical syndromes.",2002,"Tom Glaser, Nadean L Brown, Chuan-Min Chen, Susan L Dagenais"
Control of developmental timing by small temporal RNAs: a paradigm for RNA-mediated regulation of gene expression,11835276,10.1002/bies.10046,"Heterochronic genes control the timing of developmental programs. In C. elegans, two key genes in the heterochronic pathway, lin-4 and let-7, encode small temporally expressed RNAs (stRNAs) that are not translated into protein. These stRNAs exert negative post-transcriptional regulation by binding to complementary sequences in the 3' untranslated regions of their target genes. stRNAs are transcribed as longer precursor RNAs that are processed by the RNase Dicer/DCR-1 and members of the RDE-1/AGO1 family of proteins, which are better known for their roles in RNA interference (RNAi). However, stRNA function appears unrelated to RNAi. Both sequence and temporal regulation of let-7 stRNA is conserved in other animal species suggesting that this is an evolutionarily ancient gene. Indeed, C. elegans, Drosophila and humans encode at least 86 other RNAs with similar structural features to lin-4 and let-7. We postulate that other small non-coding RNAs may function as stRNAs to control temporal identity during development in C. elegans and other organisms.",2002,"Diya Banerjee, Frank Slack"
Ribosome components are associated with sites of transcription,12150910,,"It is generally believed that eukaryotic ribosomes first associate with mRNA in the cytoplasm.

Immunostaining was carried out with antibodies specific for 27 ribosomal proteins, two translation factors and one that specifically recognizes rRNA. In situ hybridization was with several probes specific for both rRNA subunits. The kinetics of recruitment following transcription initiation suggest that the association is with newly transcribed pol II transcripts.

Widespread occurrence of serpin genes with multiple reactive centre-containing exon cassettes in insects and nematodes,12137947,10.1016/s0378-1119(02)00697-2,"By applying homology-search and text-mining programs we have found that the Drosophila serine protease inhibitor (serpin) gene sp4 harbours four reactive centre-coding exons. The mutually exclusive use of these cassettes in combination with alternatively selectable exons at the 5'-end or in the 3'-untranslated region of the gene allows generation of more than ten different transcripts, all of which are expressed in Drosophila embryos. These transcripts may code for eight different Sp4 protein isoforms with different biological functions, which - dependent on the splice pattern - either may be secreted, reside in the endoplasmic reticulum, or may be located in the cytoplasm. An examination revealed the presence of two serpin genes, each coding for two or three likely alternative reactive centre exon cassettes, respectively, also in the Caenorhabditis elegans genome. The occurrence of such serpin genes in some groups of metazoa reflects a parsimonious way to enlarge the adaptive ability of these organisms to cope with a plethora of different serine and cysteine proteases.",2002,"Julia Ladewig, Olaf Krüger, Katharina Köster, Hermann Ragg"
Inducible antibacterial defense system in C. elegans,12176330,10.1016/s0960-9822(02)00928-4,"The term innate immunity refers to a number of evolutionary ancient mechanisms that serve to defend animals and plants against infection. Genetically tractable model organisms, especially Drosophila, have contributed greatly to advances in our understanding of mammalian innate immunity. Essentially, nothing is known about immune responses in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Using high-density cDNA microarrays, we show here that infection of C. elegans by the Gram-negative bacterium Serratia marcescens provokes a marked upregulation of the expression of many genes. Among the most robustly induced are genes encoding lectins and lysozymes, known to be involved in immune responses in other organisms. Certain infection-inducible genes are under the control of the DBL-1/TGFbeta pathway. We found that dbl-1 mutants exhibit increased susceptibility to infection. Conversely, overexpression of the lysozyme gene lys-1 augments the resistance of C. elegans to S. marcescens.

Mitochondrial and cytoplasmic thioredoxin reductase variants encoded by a single Drosophila gene are both essential for viability,11796729,10.1074/jbc.M111692200,"Defense against oxidative stress in mammals includes the regeneration of the major thiol reductants glutathione and thioredoxin by glutathione reductase and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), respectively. In contrast, Drosophila, and possibly insects in general, lacks glutathione reductase and must rely solely on the TrxR system. The mammalian TrxRs described so far are selenoproteins that utilize NADPH to reduce protein as well as nonprotein substrates in mitochondria and cytoplasm of cells. We show that a single Drosophila gene, Trxr-1, encodes non-selenocysteine-containing cytoplasmic and mitochondrial TrxR isoforms that differ with respect to their N termini. We generated transcript-specific mutants and used in vivo approaches to explore the biological functions of the two enzyme variants by introducing the corresponding transgenes into different Trxr-1 mutants.

Here we describe the embryonic expression patterns of the seven Toll-like genes Toll-3 through Toll-9. We find that these genes have distinct expression domains and that their expression is dynamically changing throughout embryonic development. This complex and tissue-specific regulation of Toll-like gene expression strongly suggests a role in embryonic development for most Drosophila Tolls.

The gene on chromosome 15 (MRG15) has high similarity to Drosophila MSL3, which is a component of the dosage compensation complex. MRG15 also has a chromodomain and may therefore function as a chromatin remodeling factor in a complex(es) involving a histone acetyltransferase, similar to MSL3. To complement our studies on human MRG15, we cloned and characterized the mouse MRG15 gene. Mouse MRG15 is expressed ubiquitously in adult tissues and at various embryonic stages, and expression in adult testis is higher than in other tissues. MRG15-b, which is an alternatively spliced form of MRG15-a and has a 39-amino-acid insertion in the chromodomain, is also expressed in all mouse tissues examined and localizes to the nucleus of cells. It is possible that MRG15-b may lack the function of the chromodomain because of the additional amino acids and could potentially be the equivalent of the human MORF4 in the mouse. The mouse MRG15 gene is composed of twelve exons and spans over 24 kb DNA.

Pathology of the adult central nervous system induced by genetic inhibition of programmed cell death in Drosophila pupae,11816024,10.1002/arch.10011,"In the spinster (spin) mutant of Drosophila melanogaster, the extent of programmed cell death (PCD) in the abdominal ganglion 6 h after puparium formation (APF) is significantly reduced.

After eclosion, neurodegeneration accompanied by accumulation of autofluorescent materials is manifested in the central nervous system (CNS) of the spin mutant. The materials accumulated in the spin-mutant CNS contain a substance that is immunopositive to an antibody against GM2 ganglioside. Halving the dosage of three cell death genes, rpr, grim, and hid, blocks shortening of the abdominal ganglion and induces neurodegeneration accompanied by accumulation of autofluorescent materials in the adult CNS.

This complex is located in the mitochondrial matrix, where it aids in the folding and acquisition of the tertiary structure of proteins. We have previously isolated the cpn10 cDNA in zebrafish (Danio rerio), and demonstrated that it is ubiquitously expressed during embryonic development and transcriptionally upregulated after exposure to heat shock. In the present study, we have isolated a cDNA encoding chaperonin 60 (cpn60) from zebrafish, and have shown that it is similarly expressed uniformly and ubiquitously throughout early embryonic development of zebrafish. Upregulation of cpn60 expression was also observed after exposure of zebrafish embryos to a heat shock of 1 h at 37 degrees C compared with control embryos raised at 27 degrees C. The induction of the cpn60 heat shock response was greatest after 1 h of heat shock, whereas significant decreases of cpn60 mRNA were observed within 2 h following a return to 27 degrees C. We subsequently isolated genomic DNA sequences for both of these genes, and show that they are also arranged in a head-to-head organization and share a common bidirectional promoter that contains a single heat shock element (HSE). Our database analysis shows that this head-to-head organization is also found in human (Homo sapiens), rat (Rattus norvegicus), pufferfish (Fugu rubripes), and Caenorhabditis elegans, but not in Drosophila or yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae).

Molecular and biochemical characterization of two P450 enzymes in the ecdysteroidogenic pathway of Drosophila melanogaster,12177427,10.1073/pnas.162375799,"Five different enzymatic activities, catalyzed by both microsomal and mitochondrial cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYPs), are strongly implicated in the biosynthesis of ecdysone (E) from cholesterol. However, none of these enzymes have been characterized completely. The present data show that the wild-type genes of two members of the Halloween family of embryonic lethals, disembodied (dib) and shadow (sad), code for mitochondrial cytochromes P450 that mediate the last two hydroxylation reactions in the ecdysteroidogenic pathway in Drosophila, namely the C22- and C2-hydroxylases. When sad (CYP315A1) is transfected into Drosophila S2 cells, the cells metabolize 2-deoxyecdysone (2dE) to E and the [3H]ketotriol (2,22-dideoxyecdysone) to 22-deoxyecdysone. In contrast, dib (CYP302A1) is responsible for the conversion of the [3H]ketotriol to [3H]2dE. When cells are transfected with both dib and sad, they metabolize the [3H]ketotriol to [3H]E in high yield. The expression of sad and dib is concentrated within the individual segments of the developing epidermis when there is a surge of ecdysteroid midway through embryogenesis. This result occurs before the ring gland has developed and suggests that the embryonic epidermis is a site of ecdysteroid biosynthesis. This pattern then diminishes, and, during late embryogenesis, expression of both genes is concentrated in the prothoracic gland cells of the developing ring gland. Expression of dib and sad continues to be localized in this endocrine compartment during larval development, being maximal in both the late second and third instar larvae, about the time of the premolt peaks in the ecdysteroid titer.",2002,"Lawrence I Gilbert, Michael Jarcho, Chantal Dauphin-Villemant, James T Warren, Guillermo Marques, Anna Petryk, Michael B O'Connor, Jean-Philippe Parvy"

Cross-repressive interactions of identity genes are essential for proper specification of cardiac and muscular fates in Drosophila,11861486,,"In Drosophila embryos, founder cells that give rise to cardiac precursors and dorsal somatic muscles derive from dorsally located progenitors. Individual fates of founder cells are thought to be specified by combinatorial code of transcription factors encoded by identity genes. To date, a large number of identity genes have been identified; however, the mechanisms by which these genes contribute to cell fate specification remain largely unknown. We have analysed regulatory interactions of ladybird (lb), msh and even skipped (eve), the three identity genes specifying a subset of heart and/or dorsal muscle precursors. We show that deregulation of each of them alters the number of cells that express two other genes, thus changing the ratio between cardiac and muscular cells, and the ratio between different cell subsets within the heart and within the dorsal muscles. Specifically, we demonstrate that mutation of the muscle identity gene msh and misexpression of the heart identity gene lb lead to heart hyperplasia with similar cell fate modifications. In msh mutant embryos, the presumptive msh-muscle cells switch on lb or eve expression and are recruited to form supernumerary heart or dorsal muscle cells, thus indicating that msh functions as a repressor of lb and eve. Similarly, overexpression of lb represses endogenous msh and eve activity, hence leading to the respecification of msh and eve positive progenitors, resulting in the overproduction of a subset of heart cells. As deduced from heart and muscle phenotypes of numb mutant embryos, the cell fate modifications induced by gain-of-function of identity genes are not lineage restricted. Consistent with all these observations, we propose that the major role of identity genes is to maintain their restricted expression by repressing other identity genes competent to respond positively to extrinsic signals. The cross-repressive interactions of identity genes are likely to ensure their localised expression over time, thus providing an essential element in establishing cell identity.",2002,"Teresa Jagla, Bernard Dastugue, Krzysztof Jagla, Yannick Bidet, Jean Philippe Da Ponte"
Mushroom bodies are not required for courtship behavior by normal and sexually mosaic Drosophila,12210097,10.1002/neu.10100,"To elucidate the effect of feminization of male Drosophila brain cells on courtship control, we performed a large scale screening of expression drivers that can suppress male-specific behavior with transformer gene expression. Two drivers caused essentially total courtship suppression. The expression pattern of these drivers did not show any correlation with the mushroom bodies or the antennal lobes, the regions that have been suggested to play important roles in courtship. Ablation of mushroom bodies using hydroxyurea treatment did not affect this courtship suppression. The ablation did not change either wild-type heterosexual behavior or bisexual behavior caused by transformer expression driven by the same drivers used in the previous studies to suggest the involvement of the mushroom bodies in courtship. Our results show that feminization of different nonoverlapping cells in other parts of the protocerebrum was sufficient to cause the same bisexual or suppressed-courtship phenotype. Thus, contrary to previous assumptions, the mushroom bodies are not required for the control of courtship. Present evidence supports its mediation by other distributed protocerebral regions.",2002,"Kei Ito, Asami Kido"
Embryonic assembly of a central pattern generator without sensory input,11894094,10.1038/416174a,"Locomotion depends on the integration of sensory information with the activity of central circuitry, which generates patterned discharges in motor nerves to appropriate muscles. Isolated central networks generate fictive locomotor rhythms (recorded in the absence of movement), indicating that the fundamental pattern of motor output depends on the intrinsic connectivity and electrical properties of these central circuits. Sensory inputs are required to modify the pattern of motor activity in response to the actual circumstances of real movement. A central issue for our understanding of how locomotor circuits are specified and assembled is the extent to which sensory inputs are required as such systems develop. Here we describe the effects of eliminating sensory function and structure on the development of the peristaltic motor pattern of Drosophila embryos and larvae. We infer that the circuitry for peristaltic crawling develops in the complete absence of sensory input; however, the integration of this circuitry into actual patterns of locomotion requires additional information from the sensory system. In the absence of sensory inputs, the polarity of movement is deranged, and backward peristaltic waves predominate at the expense of forward peristalsis.",2002,"Maximiliano L Suster, Michael Bate"
Cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels,12087135,10.1152/physrev.00008.2002,"Cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels are nonselective cation channels first identified in retinal photoreceptors and olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs). They are opened by the direct binding of cyclic nucleotides, cAMP and cGMP. Although their activity shows very little voltage dependence, CNG channels belong to the superfamily of voltage-gated ion channels. Like their cousins the voltage-gated K+ channels, CNG channels form heterotetrameric complexes consisting of two or three different types of subunits. Six different genes encoding CNG channels, four A subunits (A1 to A4) and two B subunits (B1 and B3), give rise to three different channels in rod and cone photoreceptors and in OSNs. Important functional features of these channels, i.e., ligand sensitivity and selectivity, ion permeation, and gating, are determined by the subunit composition of the respective channel complex. The function of CNG channels has been firmly established in retinal photoreceptors and in OSNs. Studies on their presence in other sensory and nonsensory cells have produced mixed results, and their purported roles in neuronal pathfinding or synaptic plasticity are not as well understood as their role in sensory neurons. Similarly, the function of invertebrate homologs found in Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila, and Limulus is largely unknown, except for two subunits of C. elegans that play a role in chemosensation. CNG channels are nonselective cation channels that do not discriminate well between alkali ions and even pass divalent cations, in particular Ca2+. Ca2+ entry through CNG channels is important for both excitation and adaptation of sensory cells. CNG channel activity is modulated by Ca2+/calmodulin and by phosphorylation. Other factors may also be involved in channel regulation. Mutations in CNG channel genes give rise to retinal degeneration and color blindness. In particular, mutations in the A and B subunits of the CNG channel expressed in human cones cause various forms of complete and incomplete achromatopsia.",2002,"Reinhard Seifert, U Benjamin Kaupp"

Unfortunately, some genetically manipulable model systems such as Caenorhabditis elegans may have more galectins than mammals. Recently, galectins were identified in two well-studied insect systems, Drosophila melanogaster and Anopheles gambiae. In addition to the powerful genetic manipulation available in these insect models, there is a sophisticated understanding of many biological processes in these organisms that can be directly compared and applied to mammalian systems. Understanding the roles of galectins in insects may provide insight into precise functions of galectins in mammals.",2002,"Linda G Baum, Karen E Pace"
Effect of temperature on longevity and productivity in Drosophila ananassae: evidence for adaptive plasticity and trade-off between longevity and productivity,11990765,10.1023/a:1014640604740,"The genetic response of body size to temperature in the laboratory provides an interesting example of phenotypic plasticity. We found that females of Drosophila ananassae reared to adulthood at 18 degrees C showed significant increase in body weight as compared to females reared at 25 degrees C. At a given temperature, early productivity and lifetime productivity were the highest when the rearing and test temperature were the same. The effect of test temperature was highly significant for total productivity and early productivity. The interaction between test temperature and development temperature was also highly significant. Effect of development temperature was not significant. The females reared at 18 degrees C showed greater body weight but their productivity was not significantly higher than smaller females reared at 25 degrees C. Thus, the usually close relationship between size and fecundity is lost when the size change is due to rearing temperature. These findings provide evidence for adaptive plasticity in D. ananassae. We also found a negative correlation (trade-off) between longevity and productivity, the first report of such a trade-off between longevity and productivity in D. ananassae.",2002,"Seema Sisodia, Bashisth N Singh"
Interaction of Alzheimer's beta -amyloid precursor family proteins with scaffold proteins of the JNK signaling cascade,11912189,10.1074/jbc.M108372200,"We have isolated a novel protein based on its association with Drosophila APP-like protein (APPL), a homolog of the beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) that is implicated in Alzheimer's disease. This novel APPL-interacting protein 1 (APLIP1) contains a Src homology 3 domain and a phosphotyrosine interaction domain and is expressed abundantly in neural tissues. The phosphotyrosine interaction domain of APLIP1 interacts with a sequence containing GYENPTY in the cytoplasmic domain of APPL. APLIP1 is highly homologous to the carboxyl-terminal halves of mammalian c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK)-interacting protein 1b (JIP1b) and 2 (JIP2), which also contain Src homology 3 and phosphotyrosine interaction domains. The similarity of APLIP1 to JIP1b and JIP2 includes interaction with component(s) of the JNK signaling pathway and with the motor protein kinesin and the formation of homo-oligomers. JIP1b interacts strongly with the cytoplasmic domain of APP (APPcyt), as APLIP1 does with APPL, but the interaction of JIP2 with APPcyt is weak. Overexpression of JIP1b slightly enhances the JNK-dependent threonine phosphorylation of APP in cultured cells, but that of JIP2 suppresses it. These observations suggest that the interactions of APP family proteins with APLIP1, JIP1b, and JIP2 are conserved and play important roles in the metabolism and/or the function of APPs including the regulation of APP phosphorylation by JNK. Analysis of APP family proteins and their associated proteins is expected to contribute to understanding the molecular process of neural degeneration in Alzheimer's disease.",2002,"Yutaka Kirino, Yoshimasa Yagi, Momoko Hase, Hidenori Taru, Toshiharu Suzuki, Ko-Ichi Iijima"
A single p450 allele associated with insecticide resistance in Drosophila,12351787,10.1126/science.1074170,"Insecticide resistance is one of the most widespread genetic changes caused by human activity, but we still understand little about the origins and spread of resistant alleles in global populations of insects. Here, via microarray analysis of all P450s in Drosophila melanogaster, we show that DDT-R, a gene conferring resistance to DDT, is associated with overtranscription of a single cytochrome P450 gene, Cyp6g1. Transgenic analysis of Cyp6g1 shows that overtranscription of this gene alone is both necessary and sufficient for resistance. Resistance and up-regulation in Drosophila populations are associated with a single Cyp6g1 allele that has spread globally. This allele is characterized by the insertion of an Accord transposable element into the 5' end of the Cyp6g1 gene.",2002,"T G Wilson, G Le Goff, M R Bogwitz, S Jeffers, D Heckel, R H ffrench-Constant, J L Yen, T Perry, P Batterham, E Feil, P J Daborn, N Tijet, R Feyereisen"

Electrophysiological and anatomical characterization of PDF-positive clock neurons in the intact adult Drosophila brain,16554503,10.1152/jn.00117.2006,"Daily biological rhythms in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes are controlled by circadian clocks. In Drosophila, there is a good basic understanding of both the molecular and anatomical components of the clock. In this study we directly measure, for the first time, electrophysiological properties and anatomy of individual filled large lateral PDF-positive clock neurons, a cell group believed to be involved in synchronization of the clock in constant conditions. We find that the large PDF-positive neurons are morphologically homogeneous and that their resting membrane potential is modulated both by the clock and by light inputs. Expression of a leak channel, dORK-deltaC, which has been shown to disrupt circadian locomotor rhythms, hyperpolarizes these neurons, and blocks firing. These data imply that the firing properties of large PDF neurons are both regulated by and critical for clock function.",2006,"Leslie C Griffith, Demian Park"
Coiled coil in the stalk region of ncd motor protein is nonlocally sustained,16519526,10.1021/bi051480f,"The dimeric structure of kinesin superfamily proteins plays an important role in their motile functions and characteristics. In this study, the coiled-coil-forming property of the stalk region (192-346) of Drosophila ncd, a C-terminal kinesin motor protein, was investigated by synthesizing various peptide fragments. The alpha helicity of a set of 46-residue peptides spanning the stalk region appeared too low to form a coiled-coil dimer, probably because of insufficient continuity of the hydrophobic residues at (a and d) core positions in amphipathic heptad repeats. On the other hand, several peptides with leucine residues introduced at core positions or with extensional sequences with high alpha helicity had an advantage in coiled-coil formation. When we analyzed the thermal and urea-induced unfolding of these dimeric peptides, we identified four domains having a relatively high potential to form coiled coils. Among them, three domains on the C-terminal side of the stalk region, i.e., (252-272), (276-330), and (336-346), were in the same heptad frame, although these potential coiled-coil domains were not self-sustaining individually. This is in sharp contrast to the fragment of human kinesin, (332-369), which has an extremely high tendency toward coiled-coil formation. One of the possible triggers for coiled-coil formation of the ncd stalk region may be the interaction between the motor domain and the C-terminal part of the stalk as previously revealed by X-ray crystallography. The residues, S331 and R335, seem to act as a breaking point for alpha-helix continuity. This would make the region (336-346), as the head-stalk joint, more flexible such as seen with a plus-end-directed kinesin, if this region had no interaction with the motor domain. These characteristic differences between ncd and kinesin suggest that the nonlocally sustained coiled coil of ncd is one of the factors important for minus-end-directed motility.",2006,"Masaru Tanokura, Hisayuki Morii, Takashi Shimizu, Mie Ito"
Germ line specific expression of a protein phosphatase Y interacting protein (PPYR1) in Drosophila,16530491,10.1016/j.modgep.2005.12.006,"PPYR1, the product of the CG15031 gene, was identified as a protein phosphatase Y (PPY) interacting protein in Drosophila melanogaster using a yeast two-hybrid screen. PPYR1 displays a biphasic expression pattern: the maternal protein is abundant in the developing egg chambers and in the early embryos, while the zygotic protein appears later in development and is localized specifically in the testes of the males. The maternal and zygotic gene products differ from each other in their size having apparent molecular masses of 47 and 66 kDa, respectively. The maternal PPYR1 is localized in the cytoplasm of the follicular and nurse cells and is deposited as a ribonucleoprotein complex in the oocyte. In the early embryos, the PPYR1 is distributed evenly, and it gradually diminishes during embryonic development. Zygotic PPYR1 is expressed exclusively in the testes, predominantly in the cytoplasm of the spermatocytes. PPY is localized in the nuclei of the same cells. Our results suggest that PPYR1 has two distinct developmental isoforms: a maternal protein the expression of which is independent of PPY and a zygotic protein which is co-expressed with PPY.",2006,"Viktor Dombrádi, Luke Alphey, János Gausz, Milán Szuperák, Géza Adám, Endre Kókai"
Temporal analysis of meiotic DNA double-strand break formation and repair in Drosophila females,17166055,10.1371/journal.pgen.0020200,"Using an antibody against the phosphorylated form of His2Av (gamma-His2Av), we have described the time course for the series of events leading from the formation of a double-strand break (DSB) to a crossover in Drosophila female meiotic prophase. MEI-P22 is required for DSB formation and localizes to chromosomes prior to gamma-His2Av foci. Drosophila females, however, are among the group of organisms where synaptonemal complex (SC) formation is not dependent on DSBs. In the absence of two SC proteins, C(3)G and C(2)M, the number of DSBs in oocytes is significantly reduced. This is consistent with the appearance of SC protein staining prior to gamma-His2Av foci. However, SC formation is incomplete or absent in the neighboring nurse cells, and gamma-His2Av foci appear with the same kinetics as in oocytes and do not depend on SC proteins. Thus, competence for DSB formation in nurse cells occurs with a specific timing that is independent of the SC, whereas in the oocytes, some SC proteins may have a regulatory role to counteract the effects of a negative regulator of DSB formation. The SC is not sufficient for DSB formation, however, since DSBs were absent from the heterochromatin even though SC formation occurs in these regions. All gamma-His2Av foci disappear before the end of prophase, presumably as repair is completed and crossovers are formed. However, oocytes in early prophase exhibit a slower response to X-ray-induced DSBs compared to those in the late pachytene stage. Assuming all DSBs appear as gamma-His2Av foci, there is at least a 3:1 ratio of noncrossover to crossover products. From a comparison of the frequency of gamma-His2Av foci and crossovers, it appears that Drosophila females have only a weak mechanism to ensure a crossover in the presence of a low number of DSBs.",2006,"S Mehrotra, K S McKim"
A succession of anesthetic endpoints in the Drosophila brain,16858694,10.1002/neu.20300,"General anesthetics abolish behavioral responsiveness in all animals, and in humans this is accompanied by loss of consciousness. Whether similar target mechanisms and behavioral endpoints exist across species remains controversial, although model organisms have been successfully used to study mechanisms of anesthesia. In Drosophila, a number of key mutants have been characterized as hypersensitive or resistant to general anesthetics by behavioral assays. In order to investigate general anesthesia in the Drosophila brain, local field potential (LFP) recordings were made during incremental exposures to isoflurane in wild-type and mutant flies. As in higher animals, general anesthesia in flies was found to involve a succession of distinct endpoints. At low doses, isoflurane uncoupled brain activity from ongoing movement, followed by a sudden attenuation in neural correlates of perception. Average LFP activity in the brain was more gradually attenuated with higher doses, followed by loss of movement behavior. Among mutants, a strong correspondence was found between behavioral and LFP sensitivities, thereby suggesting that LFP phenotypes are proximal to the anesthetic's mechanism of action. Finally, genetic and pharmacological analysis revealed that anesthetic sensitivities in the fly brain are, like other arousal states, influenced by dopaminergic activity. These results suggest that volatile anesthetics such as isoflurane may target the same processes that sustain wakefulness and attention in the brain. LFP correlates of general anesthesia in Drosophila provide a powerful new approach to uncovering the nature of these processes.",2006,Bruno van Swinderen
A zebrafish screen for craniofacial mutants identifies wdr68 as a highly conserved gene required for endothelin-1 expression,16759393,10.1186/1471-213X-6-28,"Background: Craniofacial birth defects result from defects in cranial neural crest (NC) patterning and morphogenesis. The vertebrate craniofacial skeleton is derived from cranial NC cells and the patterning of these cells occurs within the pharyngeal arches. Substantial efforts have led to the identification of several genes required for craniofacial skeletal development such as the endothelin-1 (edn1) signaling pathway that is required for lower jaw formation. However, many essential genes required for craniofacial development remain to be identified. Results: Through screening a collection of insertional zebrafish mutants containing approximately 25% of the genes essential for embryonic development, we present the identification of 15 essential genes that are required for craniofacial development. We identified 3 genes required for hyomandibular development. We also identified zebrafish models for Campomelic Dysplasia and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. To further demonstrate the utility of this method, we include a characterization of the wdr68 gene. We show that wdr68 acts upstream of the edn1 pathway and is also required for formation of the upper jaw equivalent, the palatoquadrate. We also present evidence that the level of wdr68 activity required for edn1 pathway function differs between the 1st and 2nd arches. Wdr68 interacts with two minibrain-related kinases, Dyrk1a and Dyrk1b, required for embryonic growth and myotube differentiation, respectively. We show that a GFP-Wdr68 fusion protein localizes to the nucleus with Dyrk1a in contrast to an engineered loss of function mutation Wdr68-T284F that no longer accumulated in the cell nucleus and failed to rescue wdr68 mutant animals. Wdr68 homologs appear to exist in all eukaryotic genomes. Notably, we found that the Drosophila wdr68 homolog CG14614 could substitute for the vertebrate wdr68 gene even though insects lack the NC cell lineage. Conclusion: This work represents a systematic identification of approximately 25% of the essential genes required for craniofacial development. The identification of zebrafish models for two human disease syndromes indicates that homologs to the other genes are likely to also be relevant for human craniofacial development. The initial characterization of wdr68 suggests an important role in craniofacial development for the highly conserved Wdr68-Dyrk1 protein complexes.",2006,"Nancy Hopkins, Robert M Nissen, Adam Amsterdam"
Decrease in the lgl tumor suppressor dose in Drosophila increases survival and longevity in stress conditions,16905287,10.1016/j.exger.2006.06.035,"Recent studies suggest that downregulation of tumor suppressor genes might not only favor cancer development but also postpone organisms' aging and increase longevity. However, there is lack of population-based studies directly supporting this idea. We studied the lgl lethal alleles which are widespread in natural Drosophila populations. We demonstrate, for the first time, that animals heterozygous on the loss-of-function lgl tumor suppressor gene display a clear pre-adult viability advantage under stressful conditions (high 29 degrees C and low 16 degrees C temperatures). We found also the survival and longevity advantage effect of the lgl loss-of-function in the temperature stress conditions. The main features of this longevity influence are following. First, the lgl-dependent life span increase is sex-dependent; in all experimental combinations males are more sensitive than females of relevant genotypes. Second, the effect is stronger under the life-shortening temperature stress, 29 degrees C, where the hormesis was demonstrated. Third, the favoring effect of reduced dosage of tumor suppressor displays clearly in old but not young animals, delaying aging. Forth, the maternal or epigenetic inheritance of thermotolerance from mother to offspring appears to strengthen the observed longevity effects. One possible explanation of this stress-adaptive effect of reduced tumor suppressor dose might be a better resistance of Drosophila post-mitotic cells to a stress-associated apoptosis at old ages.",2006,"Anatoly I Yashin, Mikhail D Golubovsky, Nataly Y Weisman, Konstantin G Arbeev, Svetlana V Ukraintseva"

Transgenic Drosophila models of Noonan syndrome causing PTPN11 gain-of-function mutations,16399795,10.1093/hmg/ddi471,"Mutations in the PTPN11 gene, which encodes the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2, causes Noonan syndrome (NS), an autosomal dominant disorder with pleomorphic developmental abnormalities. Certain germline and somatic PTPN11 mutations cause leukemias. Mutations have gain-of-function (GOF) effects with the commonest NS allele, N308D, being weaker than the leukemia-causing mutations. To study the effects of disease-associated PTPN11 alleles, we generated transgenic fruitflies with GAL4-inducible expression of wild-type or mutant csw, the Drosophila orthologue of PTPN11. All three transgenic mutant CSWs rescued a hypomorphic csw allele's eye phenotype, documenting activity. Ubiquitous expression of two strong csw mutant alleles were lethal, but did not perturb development from some CSW-dependent receptor tyrosine kinase pathways. Ubiquitous expression of the weaker N308D allele caused ectopic wing veins, identical to the EGFR GOF phenotype. Epistatic analyses established that csw(N308D)'s ectopic wing vein phenotype required intact EGF ligand and receptor, and that this transgene interacted genetically with Notch, DPP and JAK/STAT signaling. Expression of the mutant csw transgenes increased RAS-MAP kinase activation, which was necessary but not sufficient for transducing their phenotypes. The findings from these fly models provided hypotheses testable in mammalian models, in which these signaling cassettes are largely conserved. In addition, these fly models can be used for sensitized screens to identify novel interacting genes as well as for high-throughput screening of therapeutic compounds for NS and PTPN11-related cancers.",2006,"In-Kyong Kim, Huiwen Ying, Marek Mlodzik, Konstantin Gaengel, Srinivasan Krishnamoorthy, Kimihiko Oishi, Kenichi Kamiya, Marco Tartaglia, Ursula Weber, Leslie Pick, Bruce D Gelb, Lizabeth A Perkins"
From fluctuations to phenotypes: the physiology of noise,17179490,10.1126/stke.3662006re17,"There are fundamental physical reasons why biochemical processes might be subject to noise and stochastic fluctuations. Indeed, it has long been understood that random molecular-scale mechanisms, such as those that drive genetic mutation, lie at the heart of population-scale evolutionary dynamics. What we can now appreciate is how stochastic fluctuations inherent in biochemical processes contribute to cellular and organismal phenotypes. Advancements in techniques for empirically measuring single cells and in corresponding theoretical methods have enabled the rigorous design and interpretation of experiments that provide incontrovertible proof that there are important endogenous sources of stochasticity that drive biological processes at the scale of individual organisms. Recently, some studies have progressed beyond merely ascertaining the presence of noise in biological systems; they trace its role in cellular physiology as it is passed through and processed by the biomolecular pathways-from the underlying origins of stochastic fluctuations in random biomolecular interactions to their ultimate manifestations in characteristic species phenotypes. These emerging results suggest new biological network design principles that account for a constructive role played by noise in defining the structure, function, and fitness of biological systems. They further show that stochastic mechanisms open novel classes of regulatory, signaling, and organizational choices that can serve as efficient and effective biological solutions to problems that are more complex, less robust, or otherwise suboptimal to deal with in the context of purely deterministic systems. Research in Drosophila melanogaster eye color-vision development and Bacillus subtilis competence induction has elegantly traced the role of noise in vital physiological processes from fluctuations to phenotypes, and is used here to highlight these developments.",2006,"Michael S Samoilov, Gavin Price, Adam P Arkin"

A gradient in the distribution of introns in eukaryotic genes,16736103,10.1007/s00239-005-0261-6,"The majority of eukaryotic genes consist of exons and introns. Introns can be inserted either between codons (phase 0) or within codons, after the first nucleotide (phase 1) and after the second (phase 2). We report here that the frequency of phase 0 increases and phase 1 declines from the 5' region to the 3' end of genes. This trend is particularly noticeable in genomes of Homo sapiens and Arabidopsis thaliana, in which gains of novel introns in the 3' portion of genes were probably a dominant process. Similar but more moderate gradients exist in Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans genomes, where the accumulation of novel introns was not a prevailing factor. There are nine types of exons, three symmetric (0,0; 1,1; 2,2) and six asymmetric (0,1; 1,0; 1,2; 2,1; 2,0; 0,2). Assuming random distribution of different types of introns along genes, one can expect the frequencies of asymmetric exons such as 0,1 and 1,0 or 1,2 and 2,1 to be approximately equal, allowing for some variation caused by randomness. The gradient in intron distribution leads to a small but consistent and statistically significant bias: phase 1 introns are more likely at the 5' ends and phase 0 introns are more likely at the 3' ends of asymmetric exons. For the same reason, the frequency of 0,0 exons increases and the frequency of 1,1 exons decreases in the 3' direction, at least in H. sapiens and A. thaliana. The number of introns per gene also affects the distribution and frequency of phase 0 and 1 introns. The gradient provides an insight into the evolution of intron-exon structures of eukaryotic genes.",2006,"W Ward, A Ruvinsky"

T cells develop normally in the absence of both Deltex1 and Deltex2,16923970,10.1128/MCB.00149-06,"Deltex1, Deltex2, and Deltex4 form a family of related proteins that are the mammalian homologues of Drosophila Deltex, a known regulator of Notch signals. Deltex1 is highly induced by Notch signaling in thymocytes, and overexpression of Deltex1 in T-cell progenitors can block Notch signals, suggesting that Deltex1 may play an important role in regulating Notch signals during T-cell development. A recent report found that T cells develop normally in mice carrying a targeted deletion in the Deltex1 gene (S. Storck, F. Delbos, N. Stadler, C. Thirion-Delalande, F. Bernex, C. Verthuy, P.

We generated mice that lack expression of both Deltex1 and Deltex2 by gene targeting and further reduced expression of Deltex4 in Deltex1/Deltex2 double-deficient T-cell progenitors using RNA interference. Using a sensitive in vitro assay, we found that Notch signaling is more potent in cells expressing lower levels of Deltex proteins. Nevertheless, we were unable to detect any significant defects in thymocyte maturation in Deltex1/Deltex2 double-knockout mice. Together these data suggest that Deltex can act as a negative regulator of Notch signals in T cells but that endogenous levels of Deltex1 and Deltex2 are not important for regulating Notch signals during thymocyte development.",2006,"Sophie M Lehar, Michael J Bevan"
Estimating selection on nonsynonymous mutations,16299397,10.1534/genetics.105.047217,"The distribution of mutational effects on fitness is of fundamental importance for many aspects of evolution. We develop two methods for characterizing the fitness effects of deleterious, nonsynonymous mutations, using polymorphism data from two related species. These methods also provide estimates of the proportion of amino acid substitutions that are selectively favorable, when combined with data on between-species sequence divergence. The methods are applicable to species with different effective population sizes, but that share the same distribution of mutational effects. The first, simpler, method assumes that diversity for all nonneutral mutations is given by the value under mutation-selection balance, while the second method allows for stronger effects of genetic drift and yields estimates of the parameters of the probability distribution of mutational effects. We apply these methods to data on populations of Drosophila miranda and D. pseudoobscura and find evidence for the presence of deleterious nonsynonymous mutations, mostly with small heterozygous selection coefficients (a mean of the order of 10(-5) for segregating variants). A leptokurtic gamma distribution of mutational effects with a shape parameter between 0.1 and 1 can explain observed diversities, in the absence of a separate class of completely neutral nonsynonymous mutations.

An efficient promoter trap for detection of patterned gene expression and subsequent functional analysis in Drosophila,17093046,10.1073/pnas.0607652103,"Transposable elements have been used in Drosophila to detect gene expression, inactivate gene function, and induce ectopic expression or overexpression. We have combined all of these features in a single construct. A promoterless GAL4 cDNA is expressed when the construct inserts within a transcriptional unit, and GAL4 activates a GFP-encoding gene present in the same transposon. In a primary screen, patterned gene expression is detected as GFP fluorescence in the live progeny of dysgenic males. Many animals expressing GFP in distinct patterns can be recovered with relatively little effort. As expected, many insertions cause loss of function. After insertion at a genomic location, specific parts of the transposon can be excised by FLP recombinase, thus allowing it to induce conditional misexpression of the tagged gene. Therefore, both gain- and loss-of-function studies can be carried out with a single insertion in a gene identified by virtue of its expression pattern. Using this promoter trap approach, we have identified a group of cells that innervate the calyx of the mushroom body and could thus define a previously unrecognized memory circuit.",2006,"Cyrille Alexandre, Camilla Larsen, Xavier Franch-Marro, Jean-Paul Vincent, Volker Hartenstein"
Expression-guided in silico evaluation of candidate cis regulatory codes for Drosophila muscle founder cells,16733548,10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020053,"While combinatorial models of transcriptional regulation can be inferred for metazoan systems from a priori biological knowledge, validation requires extensive and time-consuming experimental work. Thus, there is a need for computational methods that can evaluate hypothesized cis regulatory codes before the difficult task of experimental verification is undertaken. We have developed a novel computational framework (termed ""CodeFinder"") that integrates transcription factor binding site and gene expression information to evaluate whether a hypothesized transcriptional regulatory model (TRM; i.e., a set of co-regulating transcription factors) is likely to target a given set of co-expressed genes. Our basic approach is to simultaneously predict cis regulatory modules (CRMs) associated with a given gene set and quantify the enrichment for combinatorial subsets of transcription factor binding site motifs comprising the hypothesized TRM within these predicted CRMs. As a model system, we have examined a TRM experimentally demonstrated to drive the expression of two genes in a sub-population of cells in the developing Drosophila mesoderm, the somatic muscle founder cells. This TRM was previously hypothesized to be a general mode of regulation for genes expressed in this cell population. In contrast, the present analyses suggest that a modified form of this cis regulatory code applies to only a subset of founder cell genes, those whose gene expression responds to specific genetic perturbations in a similar manner to the gene on which the original model was based. We have confirmed this hypothesis by experimentally discovering six (out of 12 tested) new CRMs driving expression in the embryonic mesoderm, four of which drive expression in founder cells.",2006,"Anthony A Philippakis, Martha L Bulyk, Alan M Michelson, Fangxue Sherry He, Stephen S Gisselbrecht, Beatriz Estrada, Brian W Busser"

To characterize the genomic response to hypercontraction-induced myopathy, we performed expression analysis using Affymetrix high density oligonucleotide microarrays in Drosophila Mhc hypercontraction alleles. The altered transcriptional profile of dystrophic Mhc muscles suggests an actin-dependent remodeling of the muscle cytoskeleton. Specifically, a subset of the highly up-regulated transcripts is involved in actin regulation and structural support for the contractile machinery. In addition, we identified previously uncharacterized proteins with putative actin-interaction domains that are up-regulated in Mhc mutants and differentially expressed in muscles. Several of the up-regulated proteins, including the dystrophin-related protein, MSP-300, and the homolog of the neuronal activity-regulated protein, ARC, localize to specific subcellular muscle structures that may provide key structural sites for cytoskeletal remodeling in dystrophic muscles. Defining the genome-wide transcriptional response to muscle hypercontraction in Drosophila has revealed candidate loci that may participate in the pathogenesis of muscular dystrophy and in compensatory muscle repair pathways through modulation of the actin cytoskeleton.",2006,"Enrico S Montana, J Troy Littleton"
Distinct functions of homeodomain-containing and homeodomain-less isoforms encoded by homothorax,16778079,10.1101/gad.1412606,"The homothorax (hth) gene of Drosophila melanogaster is required for executing Hox functions, for head development, and for forming the proximodistal (PD) axis of the appendages. We show that alternative splicing of hth generates two types of protein isoforms, one that contains a DNA-binding homeodomain (HthFL) and one that does not contain a homeodomain (HDless). Both types of Hth isoforms include the evolutionarily conserved HM domain, which mediates a direct interaction with Extradenticle (Exd), another homeodomain protein. We show that although both HthFL and HDless isoforms of Hth can induce the nuclear localization of Exd, they carry out distinct sets of functions during development. Surprisingly, we find that many of hth's functions, including PD patterning and most Hox-related activities, can be executed by the HDless isoforms. In contrast, antennal development shows an absolute dependency on the HthFL isoform. Thus, alternative splicing of hth results in the generation of multiple transcription factors that execute unique functions in vivo. We further demonstrate that the mouse ortholog of hth, Meis1, also encodes a HDless isoform, suggesting that homeodomain-less variants of this gene family are evolutionarily ancient.",2006,"Joaquim Culi, Daniel J McKay, Richard S Mann, Barbara Noro, Wen Zhang"
Aggregate-prone proteins are cleared from the cytosol by autophagy: therapeutic implications,17118264,10.1016/S0070-2153(06)76003-3,"Intracellular protein misfolding/aggregation are features of many late-onset neurodegenerative diseases, called proteinopathies. These include Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, tauopathies, and polyglutamine expansion diseases [e.g., Huntington's disease; and various spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), like SCA3]. There are no effective strategies to slow or prevent the neurodegeneration resulting from these diseases in humans. The mutations causing many proteinopathies (e.g., polyglutamine diseases and tauopathies) confer novel toxic functions on the specific protein, and disease severity frequently correlates with the expression levels of the protein. Thus, the factors regulating the synthesis and clearance of these aggregate-prone proteins are putative therapeutic targets. The proteasome and autophagy-lysosomal pathways are the major routes for mutant huntingtin fragment clearance. While the narrow proteasome barrel precludes entry of oligomers/aggregates of mutant huntingtin (or other aggregate-prone intracellular proteins), such substrates can be degraded by macroautophagy (which we will call autophagy). We showed that the autophagy inducer rapamycin reduced the levels of soluble and aggregated huntingtin and attenuated its toxicity in cells, and in transgenic Drosophila and mouse models. We extended the range of intracellular proteinopathy substrates that are cleared by autophagy to a wide range of other targets, including proteins mutated in certain SCAs, forms of alpha-synuclein mutated in familial forms of Parkinson's disease, and tau mutants that cause frontotemporal dementia/tauopathy. In this chapter, we consider the therapeutic potential of autophagy upregulation for various proteinopathies, and describe how this strategy may act both by removing the primary toxin (the misfolded/aggregate-prone protein) and by reducing susceptibility to apoptotic insults.",2006,"Luca Jahreiss, Brinda Ravikumar, Andrea Williams, Fiona M Menzies, Sovan Sarkar, Shinji Saiki, David C Rubinsztein"
Ciliary Phosphoinositide Regulates Ciliary Protein Trafficking in Drosophila,26723017,10.1016/j.celrep.2015.12.009,"Cilia are highly specialized antennae-like cellular organelles. Inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase E (INPP5E) converts PI(4,5)P2 into PI4P and is required for proper ciliary function. Although Inpp5e mutations are associated with ciliopathies in humans and mice, the precise molecular role INPP5E plays in cilia remains unclear. Here, we report that Drosophila INPP5E (dINPP5E) regulates ciliary protein trafficking by controlling the phosphoinositide composition of ciliary membranes. Mutations in dInpp5e lead to hearing deficits due to the mislocalization of dTULP and mechanotransduction channels, Inactive and NOMPC, in chordotonal cilia. Both loss of dINPP5E and ectopic expression of the phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase Skittles increase PI(4,5)P2 levels in the ciliary base. The fact that Skittles expression phenocopies the dInpp5e mutants confirms a central role for PI(4,5)P2 in the regulation of dTULP, Inactive, and NOMPC localization. These data suggest that the spatial localization and levels of PI(4,5)P2 in ciliary membranes are important regulators of ciliary trafficking and function.",2015,"Nayoung Lee, Chul Hoon Kim, Seok Jun Moon, Jina Park, Adriana Kavoussi, Jeong Taeg Seo"
Human ortholog of Drosophila Melted impedes SMAD2 release from TGF-β receptor I to inhibit TGF-β signaling,26039994,10.1073/pnas.1504671112,"Drosophila melted encodes a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain-containing protein that enables normal tissue growth, metabolism, and photoreceptor differentiation by modulating Forkhead box O (FOXO), target of rapamycin, and Hippo signaling pathways. Ventricular zone expressed PH domain-containing 1 (VEPH1) is the mammalian ortholog of melted, and although it exhibits tissue-restricted expression during mouse development and is potentially amplified in several human cancers, little is known of its function. Here we explore the impact of VEPH1 expression in ovarian cancer cells by gene-expression profiling. In cells with elevated VEPH1 expression, transcriptional programs associated with metabolism and FOXO and Hippo signaling were affected, analogous to what has been reported for Melted. We also observed altered regulation of multiple transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) target genes. Global profiling revealed that elevated VEPH1 expression suppressed TGF-β-induced transcriptional responses. This inhibitory effect was verified on selected TGF-β target genes and by reporter gene assays in multiple cell lines. We further demonstrated that VEPH1 interacts with TGF-β receptor I (TβRI) and inhibits nuclear accumulation of activated Sma- and Mad-related protein 2 (SMAD2). We identified two TβRI-interacting regions (TIRs) with opposing effects on TGF-β signaling. TIR1, located at the N terminus, inhibits canonical TGF-β signaling and promotes SMAD2 retention at TβRI, similar to full-length VEPH1. In contrast, TIR2, located at the C-terminal region encompassing the PH domain, decreases SMAD2 retention at TβRI and enhances TGF-β signaling. Our studies indicate that VEPH1 inhibits TGF-β signaling by impeding the release of activated SMAD2 from TβRI and may modulate TGF-β signaling during development and cancer initiation or progression.",2015,"Carl Virtanen, Maurice J Ringuette, Jeffrey L Wrana, Premalatha Shathasivam, Theodore J Brown, Alexandra Kollara"
Propagation of Homeostatic Sleep Signals by Segregated Synaptic Microcircuits of the Drosophila Mushroom Body,26455303,10.1016/j.cub.2015.09.017,"The Drosophila mushroom body (MB) is a key associative memory center that has also been implicated in the control of sleep. However, the identity of MB neurons underlying homeostatic sleep regulation, as well as the types of sleep signals generated by specific classes of MB neurons, has remained poorly understood. We recently identified two MB output neuron (MBON) classes whose axons convey sleep control signals from the MB to converge in the same downstream target region: a cholinergic sleep-promoting MBON class and a glutamatergic wake-promoting MBON class. Here, we deploy a combination of neurogenetic, behavioral, and physiological approaches to identify and mechanistically dissect sleep-controlling circuits of the MB. Our studies reveal the existence of two segregated excitatory synaptic microcircuits that propagate homeostatic sleep information from different populations of intrinsic MB ""Kenyon cells"" (KCs) to specific sleep-regulating MBONs: sleep-promoting KCs increase sleep by preferentially activating the cholinergic MBONs, while wake-promoting KCs decrease sleep by preferentially activating the glutamatergic MBONs. Importantly, activity of the sleep-promoting MB microcircuit is increased by sleep deprivation and is necessary for homeostatic rebound sleep (i.e., the increased sleep that occurs after, and in compensation for, sleep lost during deprivation). These studies reveal for the first time specific functional connections between subsets of KCs and particular MBONs and establish the identity of synaptic microcircuits underlying transmission of homeostatic sleep signals in the MB.",2015,"Gerald M Rubin, Yoshinori Aso, Xin Jin, Mario Felix, Divya Sitaraman, Nan Chen, Michael N Nitabach"

The 12 mutant, RNAi and control lines tested in this study displayed an increased survival to cold after fasting. This shows that fasting has a robust effect on survival to cold in many genotypes, but the mechanism of this effect remains unknown. This mechanism does not seem to be linked to metabolic pathways often considered to play a critical role in ageing and longevity determinations (insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 pathway and autophagy).",2015,"Éric Le Bourg, Isabelle Massou"

Versatile genetic paintbrushes: Brainbow technologies,25491327,10.1002/wdev.166,"Advances in labeling technologies are instrumental to study the developmental mechanisms that control organ formation and function at the cellular level. Until recently, genetic tools relied on the expression of single markers to visualize individual cells or lineages in developing and adult animals. Exploiting the expanding color palette of fluorescent proteins and the power of site-specific recombinases in rearranging DNA fragments, the development of Brainbow strategies in mice made it possible to stochastically label many cells in different colors within the same sample. Over the past years, these pioneering approaches have been adapted for other experimental model organisms, including Drosophila melanogaster, zebrafish, and chicken. Balancing the distinct requirements of single cell and clonal analyses, adjustments were made that both enhance and expand the functionality of these tools. Multicolor cell labeling techniques have been successfully applied in studies analyzing the cellular components of neural circuits and other tissues, and the compositions and interactions of lineages. While being continuously refined, Brainbow technologies have thus found a firm place in the genetic toolboxes of developmental and neurobiologists.

Differential Effects of Tissue-Specific Deletion of BOSS on Feeding Behaviors and Energy Metabolism,26193363,10.1371/journal.pone.0133083,"Food intake and energy metabolism are tightly controlled to maintain stable energy homeostasis and healthy states. Thus, animals detect their stored energy levels, and based on this, they determine appropriate food intake and meal size. Drosophila melanogaster putative G protein-coupled receptor, Bride of sevenless (BOSS) is a highly evolutionarily conserved protein that responds to extracellular glucose levels in order to regulate energy homeostasis. To address how BOSS regulates energy homeostasis, we characterized a boss mutant by assessing its food intake and stored energy levels. Boss mutants exhibited increased food intake but decreased stored triacylglyceride levels. Using boss-GAL4 drivers, we found that boss is expressed in select tissues that are involved in nutrient sensing and food intake, in a subset of neurons in brain and chemosensory organs, in fat body, and in endocrine cells in gut (enteroendocrine cells). Flies with tissue-specific boss knockdowns in these tissues had abnormal stored energy levels and abnormal food intake. These results suggest that BOSS in either neurons or peripheral nutrient-sensing tissues affects energy homeostasis in ways that relate to the sensing of nutrients and regulation of food intake.",2015,"Mizuki Kurosawa, Yoshio Hirabayashi, Ayako Kohyama-Koganeya"
Comparison between the modes of action of novel meta-diamide and macrocyclic lactone insecticides on the RDL GABA receptor,25987227,10.1016/j.pestbp.2014.09.011,"Macrocyclic lactones, avermectins, and milbemycins are widely used to control arthropods, nematodes, and endo- and ectoparasites in livestock and pets. Their main targets are glutamate-gated chloride channels. Furthermore, macrocyclic lactones reportedly interact with insect RDL γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors, but their modes of action on insect RDL GABA receptors remain unknown. In this study, we attempted to better understand the modes of action of macrocyclic lactones on RDL GABA receptors. We observed that ivermectin and milbemectin behaved as allosteric agonists of the Drosophila RDL GABA receptor. G336A, G336S, and G336T mutations had profound effects on the activities of ivermectin and milbemectin, and a G336M mutation abolished the allosteric agonist and antagonist activities of these macrocyclic lactones. These results suggest that G336 in TM3 of the Drosophila RDL GABA receptor is important for the binding of macrocyclic lactones. Recently, it has been suggested that a novel RDL GABA receptor antagonist, 3-benzamido-N-(2-bromo-4-perfluoroisopropyl-6-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-2-fluorobenzamide (meta-diamide 7), binds to the transmembrane intersubunit pocket near G336 in the Drosophila RDL GABA receptor. Thus, we compared the effects of mutations around G336 and A302 mutations in TM2 on the activities of macrocyclic lactone and meta-diamide 7. The effects of L281C, V340Q, V340N, A302S, and A302N mutations on the activity of meta-diamide 7 differed from those on ivermectin and milbemectin. Molecular modeling studies showed that macrocyclic lactones docked in the intersubunit pocket near G336 in the Drosophila RDL GABA receptor in the open state. In contrast, meta-diamide 7 docked into the Drosophila RDL GABA receptor in the closed state. This suggests that the modes of action of macrocyclic lactone binding to the wild-type Drosophila RDL GABA receptor differ from those of meta-diamide binding.",2015,"Kangetsu Hirase, Toshifumi Nakao, Shinichi Banba"

GFP reconstitution across synaptic partners (GRASP) experiments revealed structural connectivity defects in aged animals of DPM neurons with MB axons in the α lobe neuropil. As a consequence, a protein-synthesis-dependent LTM trace in the α/β MB neurons fails to form. Aging thus impairs protein-synthesis-dependent LTM along with the α/β MB neuron LTM trace by lessening the connectivity of DPM and α/β MB neurons.",2015,"Ronald L Davis, Ayako Tonoki"
Drosophila TRPA1 isoforms detect UV light via photochemical production of H2O2,26443856,10.1073/pnas.1514862112,"The transient receptor potential A1 (TRPA1) channel is an evolutionarily conserved detector of temperature and irritant chemicals. Here, we show that two specific isoforms of TRPA1 in Drosophila are H2O2 sensitive and that they can detect strong UV light via sensing light-induced production of H2O2. We found that ectopic expression of these H2O2-sensitive Drosophila TRPA1 (dTRPA1) isoforms conferred UV sensitivity to light-insensitive HEK293 cells and Drosophila neurons, whereas expressing the H2O2-insensitive isoform did not. Curiously, when expressed in one specific group of motor neurons in adult flies, the H2O2-sensitive dTRPA1 isoforms were as competent as the blue light-gated channelrhodopsin-2 in triggering motor output in response to light. We found that the corpus cardiacum (CC) cells, a group of neuroendocrine cells that produce the adipokinetic hormone (AKH) in the larval ring gland endogenously express these H2O2-sensitive dTRPA1 isoforms and that they are UV sensitive. Sensitivity of CC cells required dTRPA1 and H2O2 production but not conventional phototransduction molecules. Our results suggest that specific isoforms of dTRPA1 can sense UV light via photochemical production of H2O2. We speculate that UV sensitivity conferred by these isoforms in CC cells may allow young larvae to activate stress response--a function of CC cells--when they encounter strong UV, an aversive stimulus for young larvae.",2015,"Ananya R Guntur, Pengyu Gu, Jingyi Chen, Yang Xiang, Kendra Takle, Chung-Hui Yang"
P elements and the determinants of hybrid dysgenesis have different dynamics of propagation in Drosophila melanogaster populations,26530414,10.1007/s10709-015-9872-z,"Intraspecific hybrid dysgenesis (HD) appears after some strains of D. melanogaster are crossed. The predominant idea is that the movement of transposable P elements causes HD. It is believed that P elements appeared in the D. melanogaster genome in the middle of the last century by horizontal transfer, simultaneously with the appearance of HD determinants. A subsequent simultaneous expansion of HD determinants and P elements occurred. We analyzed the current distribution of HD determinants in natural populations of D. melanogaster and found no evidence of their further spread. However, full-sized P elements were identified in the genomes of all analyzed natural D. melanogaster strains independent of their cytotypes. Thus, the expansion of P elements does not correlate with the expansion of HD determinants. We found that the ovaries of dysgenic females did not contain germ cells despite the equal number of primordial germ cells in early stages in dysgenic and non-dysgenic embryos. We propose that HD does not result from DNA damage caused by P element transposition, but it would be the disruption in the regulation of dysgenic ovarian formation that causes the dysgenic phenotypes.",2015,"Olesia M Ignatenko, Natalia V Dorogova, Svetlana A Fedorova, Lyudmila P Zakharenko"
Telomere fusion in Drosophila: The role of subtelomeric chromatin,26786804,10.1080/19336934.2015.1131882,"Drosophila telomeres are maintained by transposition to chromosome ends of the HeT-A, TART and TAHRE retrotransposons, collectively designated as HTT.

The HTT sequences of YS, YL, XR, and 4L are juxtaposed to constitutive heterochromatin, while the HTTs of the other telomeres are linked to either the TAS repeat-associated chromatin (XL, 2L, 2R, 3L, 3R) or to the specialized 4R chromatin. We found that mutations in pendolino (peo) cause (telomeric fusions) that preferentially involve the heterochromatin-associated telomeres (Ha-telomeres), a telomeric fusion pattern never observed in the other 10 telomere-capping mutants characterized so far. Peo, is homologous to the E2 variant ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes and is required for DNA replication.

Circadian Clock Dysfunction and Psychiatric Disease: Could Fruit Flies have a Say?,25941512,10.3389/fneur.2015.00080,"There is evidence of a link between the circadian system and psychiatric diseases. Studies in humans and mammals suggest that environmental and/or genetic disruption of the circadian system leads to an increased liability to psychiatric disease.

Here, we examine the features which we believe make Drosophila melanogaster a model apt to study the role of the circadian clock in psychiatric disease. Despite differences in the organization of the clock system, the molecular architecture of the Drosophila and mammalian circadian oscillators are comparable and many components are evolutionarily related. In addition, Drosophila has a rather complex nervous system, which shares much at the cell and neurobiological level with humans, i.e., a tripartite brain, the main neurotransmitter systems, and behavioral traits: circadian behavior, learning and memory, motivation, addiction, social behavior. There is evidence that the Drosophila brain shares some homologies with the vertebrate cerebellum, basal ganglia, and hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis, the dysfunctions of which have been tied to mental illness. We discuss Drosophila in comparison to mammals with reference to the: organization of the brain and neurotransmitter systems; architecture of the circadian clock; clock-controlled behaviors. We sum up current knowledge on behavioral endophenotypes, which are amenable to modeling in flies, such as defects involving sleep, cognition, or social interactions, and discuss the relationship of the circadian system to these traits.

The adaptor protein 2 (AP-2) complex binds to a motif in the cytoplasmic tail of Crumbs that overlaps with the binding site of Stardust, a protein known to stabilize Crumbs on the surface. Preventing endocytosis by mutation of AP-2 causes expansion of the Crumbs-positive plasma membrane domain and polarity defects, which can be partially rescued by removing one copy of crumbs. Strikingly, knocking down both AP-2 and Stardust leads to the retention of Crumbs on the membrane. This study provides evidence for a molecular mechanism, based on stabilization and endocytosis, to adjust surface levels of Crumbs, which are essential for maintaining epithelial polarity.",2015,"Heather Currinn, Elisabeth Knust, Thomas Wassmer, Shirin Meher Pocha, Alice Rothnie, Ya-Huei Lin"
bHLH proteins involved in Drosophila neurogenesis are mutually regulated at the level of stability,25694512,10.1093/nar/gkv083,"Proneural bHLH activators are expressed in all neuroectodermal regions prefiguring events of central and peripheral neurogenesis. Drosophila Sc is a prototypical proneural activator that heterodimerizes with the E-protein Daughterless (Da) and is antagonized by, among others, the E(spl) repressors. We determined parameters that regulate Sc stability in Drosophila S2 cells. We found that Sc is a very labile phosphoprotein and its turnover takes place via at least three proteasome-dependent mechanisms. (i) When Sc is in excess of Da, its degradation is promoted via its transactivation domain (TAD). (ii) In a DNA-bound Da/Sc heterodimer, Sc degradation is promoted via an SPTSS phosphorylation motif and the AD1 TAD of Da; Da is spared in the process. (iii) When E(spl)m7 is expressed, it complexes with Sc or Da/Sc and promotes their degradation in a manner that requires the corepressor Groucho and the Sc SPTSS motif. Da/Sc reciprocally promotes E(spl)m7 degradation. Since E(spl)m7 is a direct target of Notch, the mutual destabilization of Sc and E(spl) may contribute in part to the highly conserved anti-neural activity of Notch. Sc variants lacking the SPTSS motif are dramatically stabilized and are hyperactive in transgenic flies.

Here, we manipulated O-GlcNAcylation in Drosophila and found that it regulates autophagy through Akt/dFOXO signaling. We demonstrate that O-GlcNAcylation and the levels of O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) are increased during starvation. Furthermore, Atg proteins and autolysosomes are increased in OGT-reduced flies without fasting. Atg proteins and autophagosomes are reduced in OGT-overexpressing flies.

In this study, we show that the cellular redox state regulated by Wnt signaling is critical for the maintenance and function of the differentiation niche to promote GSC progeny differentiation. Defective Wnt signaling causes the loss of the differentiation niche and the upregulated BMP signaling in differentiated GSC progeny, thereby disrupting germ cell differentiation. Mechanistically, Wnt signaling controls the expression of multiple glutathione-S-transferase family genes and the cellular redox state.

Interestingly, starvation showed similar effects on the growth and maturation of MAG. The phenotypes observed in animals where IIS signaling pathway genes were knocked down are similar to the phenotypes observed after starving beetles for 5 days PAE. These data suggest that nutrition signals working through IIS pathway regulate maturation of MAG by promoting the growth of MAG cells.",2015,"Ashlee L Anciro, Subba Reddy Palli, Jingjing Xu"
Swept source optical coherence tomography Gabor fusion splicing technique for microscopy of thick samples using a deformable mirror,25588163,10.1117/1.JBO.20.1.016012,"We present a swept source optical coherence tomography (OCT) system at 1060 nm equipped with a wavefront sensor at 830 nm and a deformable mirror in a closed-loop adaptive optics (AO) system. Due to the AO correction, the confocal profile of the interface optics becomes narrower than the OCT axial range, restricting the part of the B-scan (cross section) with good contrast. By actuating on the deformable mirror, the depth of the focus is changed and the system is used to demonstrate Gabor filtering in order to produce B-scan OCT images with enhanced sensitivity throughout the axial range from a Drosophila larvae. The focus adjustment is achieved by manipulating the curvature of the deformable mirror between two user-defined limits. Particularities of controlling the focus for Gabor filtering using the deformable mirror are presented.",2015,"Adrian Bradu, Pauline Phelan, John Rogers, Christopher Costa, Adrian Podoleanu"
The structure of the SOLE element of oskar mRNA,26089324,10.1261/rna.049601.115,"mRNA localization by active transport is a regulated process that requires association of mRNPs with protein motors for transport along either the microtubule or the actin cytoskeleton. oskar mRNA localization at the posterior pole of the Drosophila oocyte requires a specific mRNA sequence, termed the SOLE, which comprises nucleotides of both exon 1 and exon 2 and is assembled upon splicing. The SOLE folds into a stem-loop structure. Both SOLE RNA and the exon junction complex (EJC) are required for oskar mRNA transport along the microtubules by kinesin. The SOLE RNA likely constitutes a recognition element for a yet unknown protein, which either belongs to the EJC or functions as a bridge between the EJC and the mRNA. Here, we determine the solution structure of the SOLE RNA by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy. We show that the SOLE forms a continuous helical structure, including a few noncanonical base pairs, capped by a pentanucleotide loop. The helix displays a widened major groove, which could accommodate a protein partner. In addition, the apical helical segment undergoes complex dynamics, with potential functional significance.",2015,"Teresa Carlomagno, Bernd Simon, Anne Ephrussi, Pawel Masiewicz"
Overexpression of tumor suppressor protein OSCP1/NOR1 induces ER stress and apoptosis during development of Drosophila melanogaster,26175940,,"OSCP1/NOR1 (organic solute carrier partner 1/oxidored-nitro domain-containing protein 1) is known as a transporter of various organic solutes into cells and also is reported to act as a tumor suppressor protein. Although overexpression of OSCP1 has been shown to play multiple roles in mammalian cell lines, its biological significance in living organisms is not fully understood. To explore the effects of OSCP1/NOR1 on development, we performed genetic studies in flies featuring overexpression of its Drosophila orthologue, dOSCP1. Overexpression of dOSCP1 in eye imaginal discs induced a rough eye phenotype in adult flies, likely resulting from a delay in S phase progression and induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis followed by compensatory proliferation. However, it did not appear to be involved in differentiation of R7 photoreceptor cells. We also found that overexpression of dOSCP1 caused endoplasmic reticulum stress in salivary gland cells. These results indicate that overexpression of dOSCP1 exerts effects on various biological processes during Drosophila development.",2015,"Hideki Yoshida, Nguyen Tho Huu, Masamitsu Yamaguchi"
Solution NMR assignment of the cryptic sixth TOG domain of mini spindles,25971232,10.1007/s12104-015-9620-4,"TOG domains contribute to the organisation of microtubules through their ability to bind tubulin. They are found in members of the XMAP215 family of proteins, which act as microtubule polymerases and fulfill important roles in the formation of the mitotic spindle and in the assembly of kinetochore fibres. We recently identified a cryptic TOG domain in the XMAP215 family proteins, chTOG and its Drosophila homologue, mini spindles. This domain is not part of the well-established array of TOG domains involved in tubulin polymerisation. Instead it forms part of a binding site for TACC3 family proteins. This interaction is required for the assembly of kinetochore bridges in a trimeric complex with clathrin. Here we present the first NMR assignment of a sixth TOG domain from mini spindles as a first step to elucidate its structure and function.",2015,"Richard Bayliss, Selena G Burgess, Mark Pfuhl"
"Cordyceps sinensis oral liquid prolongs the lifespan of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, by inhibiting oxidative stress",26239097,10.3892/ijmm.2015.2296,"This study investigated the effect of Cordyceps sinensis oral liquid (CSOL) on the lifespan of Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly). Following the lifelong treatment of fruit flies with CSOL, lifespan was examined. The activity of copper-zinc-containing superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), manganese-containing superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) and catalase (CAT), as well as the lipofuscin (LF) content were determined. The mRNA levels of SOD1, SOD2 and CAT were quantified by qPCR. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and paraquat were used to mimic the effects of damage caused by acute oxidative stress. D-galactose was used to mimic chronic pathological aging. CSOL significantly prolonged the lifespan of the fruit flies under physiological conditions. The activity of SOD1 and CAT was upregulated, and LF accumulation was inhibited by CSOL. CSOL had no effect on the transcriptional levels (mRNA) of these enzymes. The survival time of the fruit flies which were negatively affected by exposure to H2O2 or paraquat was significantly prolonged by CSOL. In fruit flies pathologically aged by epxosure to D-galactose, CSOL also significantly prolonged their lifespan, upregulated the activity of SOD1 and CAT, and inhibited LF accumulation. The findings of our study indicate that CSOL prolongs the lifespan of fruit flies through an anti-oxidative stress pathway involving the upregulation of SOD1 and CAT activity and the inhibition of LF accumulation. CSOL may thus be explored as a novel agent for slowing the human aging process.",2015,"Yingxin Zou, Yuxiang Liu, Zhiyong Chu, Xu Feng, Jiachun Wang, Minghua Ruan, Zesheng Zhang"
Miro's N-terminal GTPase domain is required for transport of mitochondria into axons and dendrites,25855186,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1035-14.2015,"Mitochondria are dynamically transported in and out of neuronal processes to maintain neuronal excitability and synaptic function. In higher eukaryotes, the mitochondrial GTPase Miro binds Milton/TRAK adaptor proteins linking microtubule motors to mitochondria. Here we show that Drosophila Miro (dMiro), which has previously been shown to be required for kinesin-driven axonal transport, is also critically required for the dynein-driven distribution of mitochondria into dendrites. In addition, we used the loss-of-function mutations dMiroT25N and dMiroT460N to determine the significance of dMiro's N-terminal and C-terminal GTPase domains, respectively. Expression of dMiroT25N in the absence of endogenous dMiro caused premature lethality and arrested development at a pupal stage. dMiroT25N accumulated mitochondria in the soma of larval motor and sensory neurons, and prevented their kinesin-dependent and dynein-dependent distribution into axons and dendrites, respectively. dMiroT25N mutant mitochondria also were severely fragmented and exhibited reduced kinesin and dynein motility in axons. In contrast, dMiroT460N did not impair viability, mitochondrial size, or the distribution of mitochondria. However, dMiroT460N reduced dynein motility during retrograde mitochondrial transport in axons. Finally, we show that substitutions analogous to the constitutively active Ras-G12V mutation in dMiro's N-terminal and C-terminal GTPase domains cause neomorphic phenotypic effects that are likely unrelated to the normal function of each GTPase domain. Overall, our analysis indicates that dMiro's N-terminal GTPase domain is critically required for viability, mitochondrial size, and the distribution of mitochondria out of the neuronal soma regardless of the employed motor, likely by promoting the transition from a stationary to a motile state.",2015,"Migdalia Gonzalez, Gary J Russo, Milos Babic, Andrea J Wellington, Ryan M Sangston, Konrad E Zinsmaier"
Analysis of spatiotemporal expression and function of the single-minded homolog in the branchiopod crustacean Daphnia magna,25447925,10.1016/j.gene.2014.11.028,"In insect Drosophila melanogaster, ventral midline cells are crucial to formation of the central nervous system (CNS) and have roles in the specification of ectodermal neuroblasts. Notably, midline cells also have more recently recognized roles in the formation of the higher crustacean Parhyale dorso-ventral axis. The single-minded is a master regulator of ventral midline cells and is required for these functions. Recently sim expression patterns have been reported in various arthropods. These results suggest that the midline precursors evolved from ventral neuroectoderm of common ancestor Mandibulata. However, sim function has been only analyzed in few organisms. To investigate whether these functions of sim, the gene encoding Single-minded, are conserved among insects and crustaceans, we examined the embryonic expression pattern of a lower crustacean Daphnia sim homolog (dma sim) and analyzed the function of dma sim during embryonic development. The Dma Sim protein was expressed in the ventral neuroectoderm (like in onychophoran and chelicerate) and midline (like in mandibulatan). In addition to this conserved ventral neuroectoderm and midline expression, Dma Sim was expressed outside the ventral midline; it was expressed in maxilla 2, presumptive shell glands, and other tissues. To investigate dma sim function, we used RNA interference (RNAi) to inhibit dma sim in Daphnia embryos. Embryos subjected to dma sim RNAi exhibited improper axon tract formation and abnormal limb and ventral development. Furthermore, RNAi-mediated knockdown of dma slit, a putative Dma Sim target gene, resulted in similar embryonic phenotypes. These results indicated that dma sim might be required for proper dma slit-mediated ventral development in addition to being required for a conserved role in the ventral midline. Our findings indicated that sim homologs might have provided different developmental functions to ventral midline cells during metazoan evolution.",2015,"Toshihiro Ohta, Yasuhiro Shiga, Shinichi Morita, Shinichi Tokishita"

Lines of D. melanogaster previously selected for more than 190 generations for high or low levels of gregarious oviposition were crossed to a tester strain having genetically marked inversion-containing chromosomes. Genes influencing gregarious oviposition behavior are distributed over chromosome II and III. Interactions among the chromosomes were negligible as measured in this experiment. The differences in the gregarious oviposition performance of these two selected lines is due mainly to the accumulation of factors for high gregarious oviposition on chromosomes II and factors for low gregarious oviposition on chromosome III.,1994,"N Köhler, D G Ruiz-Dubreuil"
Phosrestin I undergoes the earliest light-induced phosphorylation by a calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase in Drosophila photoreceptors,8185954,10.1016/0896-6273(94)90309-3,"Activation of PI-PLC initiates two independent branches of protein phosphorylation cascades catalyzed by either PKC or Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK). We find that phosrestin I (PRI), a Drosophila homolog of vertebrate photoreceptor arrestin, undergoes light-induced phosphorylation on a subsecond time scale which is faster than that of any other protein in vivo. We determine that a CaMK activity is responsible for in vitro PRI phosphorylation at Ser366 in the C-terminal tryptic segment, MetLysSer(P)IleGluGlnHisArg, in which Ser(P) represents phosphoserine366. We also demonstrate that Ser366 is the phosphorylation site of PRI in vivo by identifying the molecular species resulting from in-gel tryptic digestion of purified phospho-PRI using HPLC-electrospray ionization tandem quadrupole mass spectroscopy. From these data, we conclude that the CaMK pathway, not the PKC pathway, is responsible for the earliest protein phosphorylation event following activation of PI-PLC in living Drosophila photoreceptors.",1994,"B T Kurien, H Matsumoto, N Komori, T Yamada, F Hayashi, E S Kahn, T Kinumi, K Isono, Y Takagi, W L Pak"
Specific DNA recognition and intersite spacing are critical for action of the bicoid morphogen,7909358,10.1128/mcb.14.5.3364,"We examined DNA site recognition by Bicoid and its importance for pattern formation in developing Drosophila embryos. Using altered DNA specificity Bicoid mutants and appropriate reporter genes, we show that Bicoid distinguishes among related DNA-binding sites in vivo by a specific contact between amino acid 9 of its recognition alpha-helix (lysine 50 of the homeodomain) and bp 7 of the site. This result is consistent with our earlier results using Saccharomyces cerevisiae but differs from that predicted by crystallographic analysis of another homeodomain-DNA interaction. Our results also demonstrate that Bicoid binds directly to those genes whose transcription it regulates and that the amino acid 9 contact is necessary for Bicoid to direct anterior pattern formation. In both Drosophila embryos and yeast cells, Bicoid requires multiple binding sites to activate transcription of target genes. We find that the distance between binding sites is critical for Bicoid activation but that, unexpectedly, this critical distance differs between Drosophila and S. cerevisiae. This result suggests that Bicoid activation in Drosophila might require an ancillary protein(s) not present in S. cerevisiae.",1994,"D Ish-Horowicz, R Brent, S D Hanes, G Riddihough"
Transposable element numbers in cosmopolitan inversions from a natural population of Drosophila melanogaster,8088526,,"Population studies of the distribution of transposable elements (TEs) on the chromosomes of Drosophila melanogaster have suggested that their copy number increase due to transposition is balanced by some form of natural selection. Theory suggests that, as a consequence of deleterious ectopic meiotic exchange between TEs, selection can favor genomes with lower TE copy numbers. This predicts that TEs should be less deleterious, and hence more abundant, in chromosomal regions in which recombination is reduced. To test this, we surveyed the abundance and locations of 10 families of TEs in recombination-suppressing chromosomal inversions from a natural population. The sample of 49 chromosomes included multiple independent isolates of seven different inversions and a corresponding set of standard chromosomes. For all 10 TE families pooled, copy numbers were significantly higher overall within low frequency inversions than within corresponding regions of standard chromosomes. TEs occupied chromosomal sites at significantly higher frequencies within the In(3R)Mo and In(3R)K inversions than within the corresponding regions of standard 3R chromosomes. These results are consistent with the predictions of the ectopic exchange model.",1994,"P D Sniegowski, B Charlesworth"

In mouse, Otp is expressed only in restricted domains of the developing forebrain, hindbrain, and spinal cord. In Drosophila, otp first appears at gastrulation in the ectodermal proctodeum and later in the hindgut, anal plate, and along the CNS. Here, we compare the Otp-, Distal-less homeobox 1-(DIx1-), Orthodenticle homolog 1-(Otx1-), Otx2-, and Empty spiracles homolog 2-expressing domains. Our results indicate that Otp is expressed along the CNS both in mouse and Drosophila; Otp could specify regional identities in the development of the forebrain and spinal cord; transcription of Otp and DIx1 takes place in alternating hypothalamic regions reminiscent of a segment-like pattern; and the structural and functional conservation could correspond to a conserved function maintained in evolution.",1994,"F Graziani, M R D'Apice, A Simeone, D Acampora, V Nigro, V Avantaggiato, J Casanova"
Modes of regulation of casein kinase II,7735316,,"Casein kinase II is unique when compared to other protein kinases; it utilizes GTP with almost the same effectiveness as ATP and exists as an active holoenzyme which does not need to be activated by dissociation of regulatory subunits or unfolding of regulatory domains. In vitro, the activity of casein kinase II is inhibited by acidic compounds and stimulated by basic compounds. Casein kinase II activity is inhibited by 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate and stimulated by polyamines at levels which are physiological in red cells. To examine the effects of autophosphorylation of the beta subunit on activity, two mutants of the Drosophila beta subunit have been constructed in which Ser-4 or Ser-(2-4) are changed to alanine residues. Analysis of autophosphorylation with wild-type and mutant recombinant holoenzymes reveals Ser-2 and Ser-3 as the major autophosphorylation sites. Autophosphorylation does not affect the phosphorylation of casein, but reduces the rate of phosphorylation of glycogen synthase by 30%, elongation factor I by 50-70%, and calmodulin by 20-40%. The data indicate that autophosphorylation of the beta subunit can negatively regulate the phosphotransferase activity of casein kinase II with physiological substrates. To examine regulation of casein kinase II activity by the beta subunit, recombinant alpha and beta subunits from human and Drosophila were expressed in Escherichia coli. Upon formation of the holoenzyme, the beta subunit stimulated the catalytic activity 4- to 5-fold. The catalytic alpha subunit contains the eleven conserved subdomains characteristic of all protein kinases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1994,"W J Lin, R Jakobi, J A Traugh"
Calcium dependence of neurotransmitter release and rate of spontaneous vesicle fusions are altered in Drosophila synaptotagmin mutants,7971978,10.1073/pnas.91.23.10888,"Since the demonstration that Ca2+ influx into the presynaptic terminal is essential for neurotransmitter release, there has been much speculation about the Ca2+ receptor responsible for initiating exocytosis. Numerous experiments have shown that the protein, or protein complex, binds multiple Ca2+ ions, resides near the site of Ca2+ influx, and has a relatively low affinity for Ca2+. Synaptotagmin is an integral membrane protein of synaptic vesicles that contains two copies of a domain known to be involved in Ca(2+)-dependent membrane interactions. Synaptotagmin has been shown to bind Ca2+ in vitro with a relatively low affinity. In addition, synaptotagmin has been shown to bind indirectly to Ca2+ channels, positioning the protein close to the site of Ca2+ influx. Recently, a negative regulatory role for synaptotagmin has been proposed, in which it functions as a clamp to prevent fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic membrane. Release of the clamp would allow exocytosis. Here we present genetic and electrophysiological evidence that synaptotagmin forms a multimeric complex that can function as a clamp in vivo. However, upon nerve stimulation and Ca2+ influx, all synaptotagmin mutations dramatically decrease the ability of Ca2+ to promote release, suggesting that synaptotagmin probably plays a key role in activation of synaptic vesicle fusion. This activity cannot simply be attributed to the removal of a barrier to secretion, as we can electrophysiologically separate the increase in rate of spontaneous vesicle fusion from the decrease in evoked response. We also find that some syt mutations, including those that lack the second Ca(2+)-binding domain, decrease the fourth-order dependence of release on Ca2+ by approximately half, consistent with the hypothesis that a synaptotagmin complex functions as a Ca2+ receptor for initiating exocytosis.",1994,"M Perin, H J Bellen, J T Littleton, M Stern"
Evidence that the 16 kDa proteolipid (subunit c) of the vacuolar H(+)-ATPase and ductin from gap junctions are the same polypeptide in Drosophila and Manduca: molecular cloning of the Vha16k gene from Drosophila,7983150,,"The 16 kDa proteolipid (subunit c) of the eukaryotic vacuolar H(+)-ATPase (V-ATPase) is closely related to the ductin polypeptide that forms the connexon channel of gap junctions in the crustacean Nephrops norvegicus. Here we show that the major protein component of Manduca sexta gap junction preparations is a 16 kDa polypeptide whose N-terminal sequence is homologous to ductin and is identical to the deduced sequence of a previously cloned cDNA from Manduca (Dow et al., Gene, 122, 355-360, 1992). We also show that a Drosophila melanogaster cDNA, highly homologous to the Manduca cDNA, can rescue Saccharomyces cerevisiae, defective in V-ATPase function, in which the corresponding yeast gene, VMA3, has been inactivated. Evidence is presented for a single genetic locus (Vha16) in Drosophila, which in adults at least contains a single transcriptional unit. Taken together, the data suggest that in Drosophila and Manduca, the same polypeptide is both the proteolipid subunit c component of the V-ATPase and the ductin component of gap junctions. The intron/exon structure of the Drosophila Vha16 is identical to that of a human Vha16 gene, and is consistent with an ancient duplication of an 8 kDa domain. A pilot study for gene inactivation shows that transposable P-elements can be easily inserted into the Drosophila ductin Vha16 gene.

Genomic DNA clones corresponding to each element were isolated and sequenced, and predicted amino acid sequences corresponding to the second (M2) and third (M3) transmembrane domains of vertebrate genes were analyzed for identity or similarity to known sequences. LCCH1 was identical to the Rdl gene, a known GABA receptor subunit gene from D. melanogaster, whereas LCCH2 and LCCH3 were novel D. melanogaster sequences that exhibited structural similarity to other members of the ligand-gated chloride channel gene family. LCCH2 was equally divergent in M2 and M3 (46-49% amino acid identity) from all other known members of this family and may therefore represent a new subunit or receptor class within this family. LCCH2 was localized by in situ hybridization to cytogenetic region 75A on the left arm of chromosome 3. LCCH3 was closely related to mammalian (79% amino acid identity) and snail (96% amino acid identity) GABA receptor beta subunits and may therefore be the homologue in D. melanogaster of this subunit class.

The cold-sensitive period for frizzled in the development of wing hair polarity ends prior to the start of hair morphogenesis,7918095,10.1016/0925-4773(94)90079-5,"The function of the frizzled (fz) gene is essential for the development of the normal pattern of hairs on the Drosophila wing. In the absence of fz function hairs develop, but they display an abnormal polarity. Mutations in fz result in an altered subcellular location for the assembly of the F-actin filled prehair that becomes the adult cuticular hair. This observation led to the suggestion that fz and other tissue polarity genes form a regulatory pathway that controls the initiation of prehairs. We have isolated a cold-sensitive fz allele and found that the cold-sensitive period for fz in the pupal wing starts in the early pupae and ends prior to the first sign of prehair morphogenesis. This cold-sensitive mutation is due to a missense mutation in a putative transmembrane domain. Western blot analysis shows that the accumulation of the mutant protein is not cold sensitive, consistent with the supposition that it is the activity of the mutant protein that is cold sensitive. Our data argue that fz has a regulatory function in specifying where the prehair forms, but no role in the actual morphogenesis of the prehair.",1994,"K H Jones, P N Adler, J Charlton, J Liu"

Differential expression during embryogenesis of three genes clustered in the Ras1 region of Drosophila melanogaster,7873789,10.1002/aja.1002010208,"Transcription mapping and nucleotide sequence analysis reveal that the genomic region of the Drosophila Ras1 gene contains a cluster of three closely localized genes. A gene termed Rlb1 is located nearby and upstream of Ras1, and is oriented in the opposite polarity relative to Ras1. In addition, a third gene termed Rlc1, is found at a very close proximity downstream to Rlb1. Ras1, the homologue of the human transforming ras genes, has been shown to be active in the posterior termini of the Drosophila embryo and in the eye imaginal disc in pathways of cell fate determination. We demonstrate that during embryogenesis Ras1 transcripts are restricted mainly to the embryonic central nervous system, suggesting that the gene product also may have a role in these nerve cells. Rlb1 encodes for a novel, lysine-rich basic protein. It is expressed mainly in the developing midgut and in the somatic mesoderm. Rlc1 also encodes for a novel, basic protein. The expression of Rlc1 during embryogenesis is similar, but not identical, to the expression pattern detected for Ras1.

Structure of the Drosophila HeT-A transposon: a retrotransposon-like element forming telomeres,7924625,10.1007/BF00368015,"Telomeres of Drosophila appear to be very different from those of other organisms.

HeT-A transposes only to chromosome ends. It appears to be a retrotransposon but has novel structural features, which may be related to its telomere functions. A consensus sequence from cloned HeT-A elements defines an element of approximately 6 kb.

Both the HeT-A ORFs contain motifs suggesting RNA binding. HeT-A-specific features include a long non-coding region, 3' of the ORFs, which makes up about half of the element. This region has a regular array of imperfect sequence repeats and ends with oligo(A), marking the end of the element and suggesting a polyadenylated RNA transposition intermediate.

The active site architecture of a short-chain dehydrogenase defined by site-directed mutagenesis and structure modeling,8003469,10.1021/bi00189a005,"A high-resolution crystal structure is not currently available for Drosophila alcohol dehydrogenase. A detailed three-dimensional model for this enzyme, based on the structure of 3 alpha,20 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, has been generated by extensive computer modeling studies. Aspects of the model concerned with coenzyme binding have been tested by site-directed mutagenesis of residues Gly-14 to Ala, Gly-19 to Ala, Asp-38 to Ala, and Pro-214 to Ser. All enzymes have been characterized in terms of kinetic constants, relative stabilities to guanidinium chloride, and heat inactivation. The contribution of NAD binding to the stabilization of each of the enzymes was also measured. The results obtained with enzymes mutated at positions 14, 38, and 214 are in accordance with published data on Drosophila alcohol dehydrogenase and suggest interactions of these residues with the cofactor NAD. The introduction of a methyl group at residue Gly-19 abolished the ability of the enzyme to utilize NADP instead of NAD. This reflects a proximity of residue Gly-19 to the ribose ring of the bound cofactor. This result, coupled to the three-dimensional model built for Drosophila alcohol dehydrogenase, suggests a binding mechanism for the cofactor NAD different from that found for 3 alpha,20 beta-dehydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and similar to that found in the crystal structure of rat liver dihydropteridine reductase.

Epstein-Barr virus infection induces expression in B lymphocytes of a novel gene encoding an evolutionarily conserved 55-kilodalton actin-bundling protein,7933116,10.1128/JVI.68.11.7320-7328.1994,"A novel human mRNA whose expression is induced over 200-fold in B lymphocytes by latent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection was reverse transcribed, cloned, and sequenced. The mRNA is predicted to encode a protein containing four peptides which precisely match amino acid sequences from a previously identified 55-kDa actin-bundling protein, p55. In vitro translation of the cDNA results in a 55-kDa protein which binds to actin filaments in the presence of purified p55 from HeLa cells. The p55 mRNA is undetectable in non-EBV-infected B- and T-cell lines or in a myelomonocytic cell line (U937). Newly infected primary human B lymphocytes, EBV-transformed B-cell lines, latently infected Burkitt tumor cells expressing EBNA2 and LMP1, a chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line (K562), and an osteosarcoma cell line (TK143) contain high levels of p55 mRNA or protein. In EBV-transformed B cells, p55 localizes to perinuclear cytoplasm and to cell surface processes that resemble filopodia. The p55 mRNA is detected at high levels in spleen and brain tissues, at moderate levels in lung and placenta tissues, and at low levels in skeletal muscle, liver, and tonsil tissues and is undetectable in heart, kidney, pancreas, and bone marrow tissues. Immunohistochemical staining of human brain tissue demonstrates p55 localization to the perinuclear cytoplasm and dendritic processes of many, but not all, types of cortical or cerebellar neurons, to glial cells, and to capillary endothelial cells. In cultured primary rat neurons, p55 is distributed throughout the perinuclear cytoplasm and in subcortical filamentous structures of dendrites and growth cones. p55 is highly evolutionarily conserved since it shows 40% amino acid sequence identity to the Drosophila singed gene product and 37% identity to fascin, an echinoderm actin-bundling protein. The evolutionary conservation of p55 and its lack of extensive homology to other actin-binding proteins suggest that p55 has specific microfilament-associated functions in cells in which it is differentially expressed, including neural cells and EBV-transformed B lymphocytes.",1994,"G Mosialos, R W Baughman, M Birkenbach, P Matsudaira, F Matsumura, E Kieff, S Yamashiro, L Vara"
Genetic characterization of Drosophila RBP-J kappa (suppressor of hairless) as a neurogenic gene in adult PNS development,7857674,10.1266/jjg.69.701,"Drosophila RBP-J kappa is a novel sequence-specific DNA binding protein encompassing the integrase motif which is highly conserved in various organisms. Its gene has been shown to be identical to Suppressor of Hairless which regulates adult peripheral nervous system (PNS) development. To elucidate the precise function of the RBP-J kappa protein in adult PNS development, we analyzed transgenic files that misexpress the RBP-J kappa protein. Such studies have shown that RBP-J kappa regulates PNS cell fate in at least two steps: commitment to sensory mother cell by lateral inhibition and terminal differentiation into the socket and shaft cells. Taken together with analysis of phenotypes of Suppressor of Hairless mutants, RBP-J kappa shows the synergistic activity with neurogenic genes.",1994,"K Tamura, T Honjo, Y Kobayakawa, T Furukawa, M Kawaichi, T Tanimura, K Kimura"
"A DNA-binding activity, TRAC, specific for the TRA element of the transferrin receptor gene copurifies with the Ku autoantigen",8022786,10.1073/pnas.91.14.6354,"We have previously described purification and characterization of a nuclear protein, TREF, which interacts specifically with the transcriptional control element, TRA, of the human transferrin receptor (TR) gene. In this report we show that TREF can be separated into two functionally distinct DNA-binding activities. The first DNA-binding activity (TRAC) is highly specific for the 8-bp element TRA and the related Escherichia coli cAMP receptor binding site. This motif is homologous to the phorbol 12-tetradecanoate 13-acetate- and cAMP-responsive elements of eukaryotic genes and the regulatory proximal sequence elements of the U1 small nuclear RNA gene and is also present in the promoter of the Drosophila melanogaster yolk protein factor 1 gene. In striking contrast, the second activity exhibits high affinity for the ends of double-stranded DNA in a sequence-unspecific manner and is attributable to the heterodimeric Ku autoantigen. Notably, transcription of Ku is induced during mid-late G0/G1 with kinetics similar to the TR gene. Ku is a highly abundant nuclear protein possessing nonspecific affinity for the ends of DNA, whose biological role remains to be elucidated. A transcriptional role for this protein has been proposed, however, on the basis of studies attributing DNA sequence-specific binding activity, notably for TRA-like sequences described above, directly to the Ku heterodimer. The observation that Ku-mediated nonspecific DNA-binding activity copurifies with the TRA-specific activity, TRAC, clearly has implications for these and related studies. The unusual properties of TRAC activity and its relationship, if any, with the enigmatic Ku protein, are discussed.",1994,"L Hunihan, M R Roberts, F H Ruddle, A Fienberg, Y Han"
Characterization of the Spodoptera frugiperda TATA-binding protein: nucleotide sequence and response to baculovirus infection,7520800,10.1016/0965-1748(94)90057-4,A cDNA clone containing a 921 bp open-reading frame (307 amino acids; 34 kDa) homologous to the TATA-binding protein (TBP) was isolated and sequenced from a Spodoptera frugiperda cell line that is commonly used in the baculovirus expression system. Analysis of the S. frugiperda TBP (SfTBP) sequence showed that the amino-terminal portion of SfTBP diverged significantly from that of other TBP sequences including Drosophila melanogaster whereas the carboxy-terminal sequence was highly conserved. Southern blot analysis indicated that SfTBP was encoded by a single gene in the S. frugiperda genome. Northern blot analysis indicated that steady-state levels of the 1.3 kb SfTBP transcript declined by 24 h post-infection corresponding to the time of virus-induced inhibition of host-cell transcription. Corresponding western blot analysis showed that TBP protein levels remain constant up to 72 h post-infection.,1994,"C Rasmussen, G F Rohrmann"

Photic input pathways that mediate the Drosophila larval response to light and circadian rhythmicity are developmentally related but functionally distinct,15593374,10.1002/cne.20383,"The Drosophila melanogaster larval photosensory organ that mediates the response to light consists of bilaterally symmetrical clusters of 12 photoreceptors. These are distinguished on the basis of expression of the rhodopsins Rh5 and Rh6. The Rh6-expressing cells correspond to the Hofbauer-Buchner (H-B) eyelet found later in the posterior margin of the adult compound eye and recently shown to function as an input pathway in the entrainment of circadian rhythmicity in adult Drosophila. In addition, the axons of the larval photoreceptors are found in intimate association with a subset of the main circadian pacemaker neurons located in the developing accessory medulla, the small ventral lateral neurons (LNv). The observed spatial overlap between components of the circadian circuitry, input pathway, and pacemaker neurons-and the larval visual organ-suggest a functional relationship between these two photosensory input pathways. In this study we determined the requirement of specific rhodopsin-expressing photoreceptors including the presumptive H-B eyelet and pacemaker neurons in the larval locomotory response to visual stimuli.

Immunocytochemistry demonstrated that D-hil is localized to the neuropil of the embryonic CNS, to the cellular cortex of dividing neuroblasts from larval brains, and that it is up-regulated in the cleavage furrow of S2 cells. We show that D-hil distribution overlaps extensively with that of the septin family member Pnut. Cross-immunoprecipitation experiments further indicated that the two proteins may be members of the same protein complex. Analysis of a severe hypomorphic P-element mutation in the D-hil locus suggested that D-hil is a nonessential protein. However, by creating double mutant flies we show that the D-hil locus acts as a modulator of Pnut function by increasing the level of polyploidy of neuroblasts in Pnut(KG00478)/Pnut(KG00478) larval brains. Based on these results we propose that D-hil may function as a regulator of septin function during cytokinesis in the developing nervous system.",2005,"Kristen M Johansen, Yun Ji, Uttama Rath, Jack Girton, Jørgen Johansen"

"Characterization of a D2-like dopamine receptor (AmDOP3) in honey bee, Apis mellifera",15944083,10.1016/j.ibmb.2005.03.005,"Dopamine is an important neurotransmitter in vertebrate and invertebrate nervous systems and is widely distributed in the brain of the honey bee, Apis mellifera. We report here the functional characterization and cellular localization of the putative dopamine receptor gene, Amdop3, a cDNA clone isolated and identified in previous studies as AmBAR3 (Apis mellifera Biogenic Amine Receptor 3). The Amdop3 cDNA encodes a 694 amino acid protein, AmDOP3. Comparison of AmDOP3 to Drosophila melanogaster sequences indicates that it is orthologous to the D2-like dopamine receptor, DD2R. Using AmDOP3 receptors expressed in HEK293 cells we show that of the endogenous biogenic amines, dopamine is the most potent AmDOP3 agonist, and that activation of AmDOP3 receptors results in down regulation of intracellular levels of cAMP, a property characteristic of D2-like dopamine receptors. In situ hybridization reveals that Amdop3 is widely expressed in the brain but shows a pattern of expression that differs from that of either Amdop1 or Amdop2, both of which encode D1-like dopamine receptors.

Condensation of the central nervous system in embryonic Drosophila is inhibited by blocking hemocyte migration or neural activity,15708571,10.1016/j.ydbio.2004.12.020,"Condensation is a process whereby a tissue undergoes a coordinated decrease in size and increase in cellular density during development. Although it occurs in many developmental contexts, the mechanisms underlying this process are largely unknown. Here, we investigate condensation in the embryonic Drosophila ventral nerve cord (VNC). Two major events coincide with condensation during embryogenesis: the deposition of extracellular matrix by hemocytes, and the onset of central nervous system activity. We find that preventing hemocyte migration by removing the function of the Drosophila VEGF receptor homologue, Pvr, or by disrupting Rac1 function in these cells, inhibits condensation. In the absence of hemocytes migrating adjacent to the developing VNC, the extracellular matrix components Collagen IV, Viking and Peroxidasin are not deposited around this tissue. Blocking neural activity by targeted expression of tetanus toxin light chain or an inwardly rectifying potassium channel also inhibits condensation. We find that disrupting Rac1 function in either glia or neurons, including those located in the nerve cord, causes a similar phenotype. Our data suggest that condensation of the VNC during Drosophila embryogenesis depends on both hemocyte-deposited extracellular matrix and neural activity, and allow us to propose a mechanism whereby these processes work together to shape the developing central nervous system.",2005,"Damon T Page, Birgitta Olofsson"
"Rapid, nongenomic responses to ecdysteroids and catecholamines mediated by a novel Drosophila G-protein-coupled receptor",15987944,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1005-05.2005,"Nongenomic response pathways mediate many of the rapid actions of steroid hormones, but the mechanisms underlying such responses remain controversial. In some cases, cell-surface expression of classical nuclear steroid receptors has been suggested to mediate these effects, but, in a few instances, specific G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have been reported to be responsible. Here, we describe the activation of a novel, neuronally expressed Drosophila GPCR by the insect ecdysteroids ecdysone (E) and 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E). This is the first report of an identified insect GPCR interacting with steroids. The Drosophila melanogaster dopamine/ecdysteroid receptor (DmDopEcR) shows sequence homology with vertebrate beta-adrenergic receptors and is activated by dopamine (DA) to increase cAMP levels and to activate the phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathway. Conversely, E and 20E show high affinity for the receptor in binding studies and can inhibit the effects of DA, as well as coupling the receptor to a rapid activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. The receptor may thus represent the Drosophila homolog of the vertebrate ""gamma-adrenergic receptors,"" which are responsible for the modulation of various activities in brain, blood vessels, and pancreas. Thus, DmDopEcR can function as a cell-surface GPCR that may be responsible for some of the rapid, nongenomic actions of ecdysteroids, during both development and signaling in the mature adult nervous system.",2005,"Esther J Yu, Peter D Evans, Vincenzina Reale, Heather Chatwin, Deepak P Srivastava, Maureen Hamon, Trevor Smith, Karen Kennedy"

The six gene-rich segments form a spatially segregated unstable cluster dependent on nonmatrix nuclear proteins. The resulting composite structure formed by clusters of gene-rich and gene-poor regions is reproducible between the nuclei.

An Sp1/KLF binding site is important for the activity of a Polycomb group response element from the Drosophila engrailed gene,16155187,10.1093/nar/gki827,"Polycomb-group response elements (PREs) are DNA elements through which the Polycomb-group (PcG) of transcriptional repressors act.

PREs are complex elements, made up of binding sites for many proteins. Our laboratory has been working to define all the sequences and DNA binding proteins required for the activity of a 181 bp PRE from the Drosophila engrailed gene. Here we show that one of the sites necessary for PRE activity, Site 2, can be bound by members of the Sp1/KLF family of zinc finger proteins. There are 10 Sp1/KLF family members in Drosophila, and nine of them bind to Site 2. We derive a consensus binding site for the Sp1/KLF Drosophila family members and show that this consensus sequence is present in most of the molecularly characterized PREs.

FMRP interferes with the Rac1 pathway and controls actin cytoskeleton dynamics in murine fibroblasts,15703194,10.1093/hmg/ddi077,"Fragile X syndrome, the most common form of inherited mental retardation, is caused by absence of FMRP, an RNA-binding protein implicated in regulation of mRNA translation and/or transport. We have previously shown that dFMR1, the Drosophila ortholog of FMRP, is genetically linked to the dRac1 GTPase, a key player in actin cytoskeleton remodeling. Here, we demonstrate that FMRP and the Rac1 pathway are connected in a model of murine fibroblasts. We show that Rac1 activation induces relocalization of four FMRP partners to actin ring areas. Moreover, Rac1-induced actin remodeling is altered in fibroblasts lacking FMRP or carrying a point-mutation in the KH1 or in the KH2 RNA-binding domain. In absence of wild-type FMRP, we found that phospho-ADF/Cofilin (P-Cofilin) level, a major mediator of Rac1 signaling, is lowered, whereas the level of protein phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit (PP2Ac), a P-Cofilin phosphatase, is increased. We show that FMRP binds with high affinity to the 5'-UTR of pp2acbeta mRNA and is thus a likely negative regulator of its translation.

SCFbeta-TRCP controls clock-dependent transcription via casein kinase 1-dependent degradation of the mammalian period-1 (Per1) protein,15917222,10.1074/jbc.M502862200,"Circadian rhythms are controlled by the periodic accumulation of Period proteins, which act as transcriptional repressors of Clock-dependent genes. Period genes are themselves Clock targets, thereby establishing a negative transcriptional feedback circuit controlling circadian periodicity. Previous data have implicated the CK1epsilon isolog Doubletime (Dbt) and the F-box protein Slimb in the regulation of Drosophila Period (Per) through an unknown mechanism. In this work, we have identified components of the machinery involved in regulating the abundance of human Per1 in tissue culture cells. CK1epsilon and CK1gamma2 were found to bind to Per1 and to promote its degradation in an in vivo degradation assay. Per1 turnover was blocked by a dominant negative version of the Cul1 protein, a component of the SCF (Skp1-Cul1-F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase. We screened a panel of F-box proteins for those that would associate with Per1 in a CK1epsilon-dependent manner, and we identified beta-TRCP1 and beta-TRCP2, isologs of the Drosophila Slimb protein. RNA interference against beta-transducin repeat-containing protein (beta-TRCP) stabilizes endogenous and exogenous Per1. beta-TRCP associates with sequences near the N terminus of Per1 in a region distinct from the previously characterized CK1epsilon-binding site. beta-TRCP and CK1epsilon promote Per1 ubiquitination in vitro. Finally, RNA interference against beta-TRCP greatly decreases Clock-dependent gene expression in tissue culture cells, indicating that beta-TRCP controls endogenous Per1 activity and the circadian clock by directly targeting Per1 for degradation.",2005,"Xiaolu L Ang, J Wade Harper, Jianping Jin, Takahiro Shirogane"
Phosphorylation of maskin by Aurora-A participates in the control of sequential protein synthesis during Xenopus laevis oocyte maturation,15687499,10.1074/jbc.M410584200,"At the end of oogenesis, Xenopus laevis stage VI oocytes are arrested at the G2/M transition (prophase) waiting for progesterone to release the block and begin maturation. Progesterone triggers a cascade of phosphorylation events such as a decrease of pK(a) and an increase of maturating-promoting factor activity. Progression through meiosis was controlled by the sequential synthesis of several proteins. For instance, the MAPK kinase kinase c-Mos is the very first protein to be produced, whereas cyclin B1 appears only after meiosis I. After the meiotic cycles, the oocyte arrests at metaphase of meiosis II with an elevated c-Mos kinase activity (cytostatic factor). By using a two-hybrid screen, we have identified maskin, a protein involved in the control of mRNA sequential translation, as a binding partner of Aurora-A, a protein kinase necessary for oocyte maturation. Here we showed that, in vitro, Aurora-A directly binds to maskin and that both proteins can be co-immunoprecipitated from oocyte extracts, suggesting that they do associate in vivo. We also demonstrated that Aurora-A phosphorylates maskin on a Ser residue conserved in transforming acidic coiled coil proteins from Drosophila to human. When the phosphorylation of this Ser was inhibited in vivo by microinjection of synthetic peptides that mimic the maskin-phosphorylated sequence, we observed a premature maturation. Under these conditions, proteins such as cyclin B1 and Cdc6, which are normally detected only in meiosis II, were massively produced in meiosis I before the occurrence of the nuclear envelope breakdown. This result strongly suggests that phosphorylation of maskin by Aurora-A prevents meiosis II proteins from being produced during meiosis I.",2005,"Yannick Arlot-Bonnemains, Claude Prigent, Jean-Yves Cremet, Jean-Guy Delcros, Gaetan Pascreau"
The heparan sulfate proteoglycan syndecan is an in vivo ligand for the Drosophila LAR receptor tyrosine phosphatase,16213816,10.1016/j.cub.2005.08.035,"Background: Receptor tyrosine phosphatases (RPTPs) are essential for axon guidance and synaptogenesis in Drosophila. Each guidance decision made by embryonic motor axons during outgrowth to their muscle targets requires a specific subset of the five neural RPTPs. The logic underlying these requirements, however, is still unclear, partially because the ligands recognized by RPTPs at growth cone choice points have not been identified. RPTPs in general are still ""orphan receptors"" because, while they have been found to interact in vitro with many different proteins, their in vivo ligands are unknown. Results: Here we use a new type of deficiency screen to identify the transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan Syndecan (Sdc) as a ligand for the neuronal RPTP LAR. LAR interacts with the glycosaminoglycan chains of Syndecan in vitro with nanomolar affinity. Genetic interaction studies using Sdc and Lar LOF mutations demonstrate that Sdc contributes to LAR's function in motor axon guidance. We also show that overexpression of Sdc on muscles generates the same phenotype as overexpression of LAR in neurons and that genetic removal of LAR suppresses the phenotype produced by ectopic muscle Sdc. Finally, we show that there is at least one additional, nonproteoglycan, ligand for LAR encoded in the genome. Conclusions: Taken together, our results demonstrate that Sdc on muscles can interact with neuronal LAR in vivo and that binding to Sdc increases LAR's signaling efficacy. Thus, Sdc is a ligand that can act in trans to positively regulate signal transduction through LAR within neuronal growth cones.",2005,"Kai Zinn, A Nicole Fox"
The fate of isolated blastomeres with respect to germ cell formation in the amphipod crustacean Parhyale hawaiensis,15617682,10.1016/j.ydbio.2004.09.030,"Germ cells may be specified through the localization of germ line determinants to specific cells in early embryogenesis, or by inductive signals from neighboring cells to germ cell precursors in later embryogenesis. Such determinants can be produced and localized during or after oogenesis, either autonomously by oocytes or by associated nutritive cells. In Drosophila, each oocyte is connected to nurse cells by cytoplasmic bridges, and determinants synthesized in nurse cells are transported through these bridges to the oocyte. However, the Drosophila model may not be applicable to all arthropods, since in many species of all four extant arthropod classes, gametogenesis functions without nurse cells. In this paper, I use immunodetection of Vasa protein to study germ cell development in the amphipod crustacean Parhyale hawaiensis, a species whose ovaries lack nurse cells and whose eggs lack obvious polarity. Previous cell lineage analyses have shown that all three germ layers and the germ line are exclusively specified by third cleavage. In the present study, I use a molecular marker to follow germ cell development during P. hawaiensis embryogenesis. I determine the capacity of individual blastomeres to form germ cells by isolating blastomeres at early cleavage stages and provide experimental evidence for localized germ cell determinants at the two-cell stage in P. hawaiensis. These experiments indicate that many aspects of early amphipod development, including timing and symmetry of cell division, the transition from holoblastic to superficial cleavage, and possibly some gastrulation movements, are cell autonomous following first cleavage.",2005,Cassandra G Extavour

One measure of cold resistance that varies geographically in Drosophila melanogaster and that is amenable to genetic analysis is chill-coma recovery. Three replicate lines of D. melanogaster were selected every second generation, for over 30 generations, for decreased recovery time following exposure to 0 degrees C. Correlated responses were scored to characterize underlying physiological traits and to investigate interactions with other traits. Lines responded rapidly to the intermittent selection regime with realized heritabilities varying from 33% to 46%. Selected lines showed decreased recovery time after exposure to a broad range of low temperatures and also had a lower mortality following a more severe cold shock, indicating that a general mechanism underlying cold resistance had been selected. The selection response was independent of plastic changes in cold resistance because the selected lines maintained their ability to harden (i.e. a short-term exposure to cool temperature resulted in decreased recovery time in subsequent chill-coma assays). Changes in cold resistance were not associated with changes in resistance to high temperature exposure, and selected lines showed no changes in wing size, development time or viability. However, there was a decrease in longevity in the selected lines due to an earlier onset of ageing. These results indicate that chill-coma recovery can be rapidly altered by selection, as long as selection is undertaken every second generation to avoid carry-over effects, and suggest that lower thermal limits can be shifted towards increased cold resistance independently of upper thermal limits and without tradeoffs in many life-history traits.",2005,"Ary A Hoffmann, Alisha R Anderson, Stephen W McKechnie"
"lin-8, which antagonizes Caenorhabditis elegans Ras-mediated vulval induction, encodes a novel nuclear protein that interacts with the LIN-35 Rb protein",16020796,10.1534/genetics.104.034173,"Ras-mediated vulval development in C. elegans is inhibited by the functionally redundant sets of class A, B, and C synthetic Multivulva (synMuv) genes. Three of the class B synMuv genes encode an Rb/DP/E2F complex that, by analogy with its mammalian and Drosophila counterparts, has been proposed to silence genes required for vulval specification through chromatin modification and remodeling. Two class A synMuv genes, lin-15A and lin-56, encode novel nuclear proteins that appear to function as a complex. We show that a third class A synMuv gene, lin-8, is the defining member of a novel C. elegans gene family. The LIN-8 protein is nuclear and can interact physically with the product of the class B synMuv gene lin-35, the C. elegans homolog of mammalian Rb. LIN-8 likely acts with the synMuv A proteins LIN-15A and LIN-56 in the nucleus, possibly in a protein complex with the synMuv B protein LIN-35 Rb. Other LIN-8 family members may function in similar complexes in different cells or at different stages. The nuclear localization of LIN-15A, LIN-56, and LIN-8, as well as our observation of a direct physical interaction between class A and class B synMuv proteins, supports the hypothesis that the class A synMuv genes control vulval induction through the transcriptional regulation of gene expression.",2005,"Ewa M Davison, Marc Vidal, Albertha J M Walhout, Melissa M Harrison, H Robert Horvitz"
Evolution of dorsal-ventral axis formation in arthropod appendages: H15 and optomotor-blind/bifid-type T-box genes in the millipede Glomeris marginata (Myriapoda: Diplopoda),15642089,10.1111/j.1525-142X.2005.05006.x,"In Drosophila, the T-box genes optomotor-blind (omb) and H15 have been implicated in specifying the development of the dorso-ventral (DV) axis of the appendages. Results from the spider Cupiennius salei have suggested that this DV patterning system may be at least partially conserved. Here we extend the study of the DV patterning genes omb and H15 to a representative of the Myriapoda in order to add to the existing comparative data set and to gain further insight into the evolution of the DV patterning system in arthropod appendages. The omb gene of the millipede Glomeris marginata is expressed on the dorsal side of all appendages including trunk legs, maxillae, mandibles, and antennae. This is similar to what is known from Drosophila and Cupiennius and suggests that the role of omb in instructing dorsal fates is conserved in arthropods. Interestingly, the lobe-shaped portions of the mouthparts do not express omb, indicating that these are ventral components and thus may be homologous to the endites present in the corresponding appendages in insects. Concerning the H15 gene we were able to identify two paralogous genes in Glomeris. Both genes are expressed in the sensory organs of the maxilla and antenna, but only Gm-H15-1 is expressed along the ventral side of the trunk legs. The expression is more extensive than in Cupiennius, but less so than in Drosophila. In addition, no ventral expression domain is present in the maxilla, mandible, and antenna. Because of this, the role of H15 in the determination of ventral fate remains unclear.",2005,"Wim G M Damen, Ralf Janssen, Nikola-Michael Prpic, Diethard Tautz"
Detecting tissue-specific alternative splicing and disease-associated aberrant splicing of the PTCH gene with exon junction microarrays,16203740,10.1093/hmg/ddi369,"Mutations in the human ortholog of Drosophila patched (PTCH) have been identified in patients with autosomal dominant nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS), characterized by minor developmental anomalies and an increased incidence of cancers such as medulloblastoma and basal cell carcinoma. We identified many isoforms of PTCH mRNA involving exons 1-5, exon 10 and a novel exon, 12b, generated by alternative splicing (AS), most of which have not been deposited in GenBank nor discussed earlier. To monitor splicing events of the PTCH gene, we designed oligonucleotide arrays on which exon probes and exon-exon junction probes as well as a couple of intron probes for the PTCH gene were placed in duplicate. Probe intensities were normalized on the basis of the total expression of PTCH and probe sensitivity. Tissue-specific regulation of AS identified with the microarrays closely correlated with the results obtained by RT-PCR. Of note, the novel exon, exon 12b, was specifically expressed in the brain and heart, especially in the cerebellum. Additionally, using these microarrays, we were able to detect disease-associated aberrant splicings of the PTCH gene in two patients with NBCCS. In both cases, cryptic splice donor sites located either in an exon or in an intron were activated because of the partial disruption of the consensus sequence for the authentic splice donor sites due to point mutations. Taken together, oligonucleotide microarrays containing exon junction probes are demonstrated to be a powerful tool to investigate tissue-specific regulation of AS and aberrant splicing taking place in genetic disorders.",2005,"Yoichi Kohno, Hideki Uchikawa, Kazuaki Nagao, Katsunori Fujii, Toshiyuki Miyashita, Naoyuki Togawa, Masao Yamada"
"Asymmetry in the burial of hydrophobic residues along the histone chains of eukarya, archaea and a transcription factor",16242031,10.1186/1472-6807-5-20,"Background: The histone fold is a common structural motif of proteins involved in the chromatin packaging of DNA and in transcription regulation. This single chain fold is stabilized by either homo- or hetero-dimer formation in archaea and eukarya. X-ray structures at atomic resolution have shown the eukaryotic nucleosome core particle to consist of a central tetramer of two bound H3-H4 dimers flanked by two H2A-H2B dimers. The c-terminal region of the H3 histone fold involved in coupling the two eukaryotic dimers of the tetramer, through a four-fold helical bundle, had previously been shown to be a region of reduced burial of hydrophobic residues within the dimers, and thereby provide a rationale for the observed reduced stability of the H3-H4 dimer compared with that of the H2A-H2B dimer. Furthermore, comparison between eukaryal and archaeal histones had suggested that this asymmetry in the distribution of hydrophobic residues along the H3 histone chains could be due to selective evolution that enhanced the coupling between the eukaryotic dimers of the tetramer. Results and discussion: The present work describes calculations utilizing the X-ray structures at atomic resolution of a hyperthermophile from Methanopyrus kandleri (HMk) and a eukaryotic transcription factor from Drosophila melanogaster (DRm), that are structurally homologous to the eukaryotic (H3-H4)2 tetramer. The results for several other related structures are also described. Reduced burial of hydrophobic residues, at the homologous H3 c-terminal regions of these structures, is found to parallel the burial at the c-terminal regions of the H3 histones and is, thereby, expected to affect dimer stability and the processes involving histone structural rearrangement. Significantly different sequence homology between the two histones of the HMk doublet with other archaeal sequences is observed, and how this might have occurred during selection to enhance tetramer stability is described.",2005,B David Silverman
Developmental analysis and squamous morphogenesis of the peripodial epithelium in Drosophila imaginal discs,16236766,10.1242/dev.02092,"Imaginal discs of Drosophila provide an excellent system with which to study morphogenesis, pattern formation and cell proliferation in an epithelium. Discs are sac-like in structure and are composed of two epithelial layers: an upper peripodial epithelium and lower disc proper. Although development of the disc proper has been studied extensively in terms of cell proliferation, cell signaling mechanisms and pattern formation, little is known about these same processes in the peripodial epithelium. We address this topic by focusing on morphogenesis, compartmental organization, proliferation and cell lineage of the PE in wing, second thoracic leg (T2) and eye discs. We show that a subset of peripodial cells in different imaginal discs undergo a cuboidal-to-squamous cell shape change at distinct larval stages. We find that this shape change requires both Hedgehog and Decapentapelagic, but not Wingless, signaling. Additionally, squamous morphogenesis shifts the anteroposterior (AP) compartment boundary in the peripodial epithelium relative to the stationary AP boundary in the disc proper. Finally, by lineage tracing cells in the PE, we surprisingly find that peripodial cells are displaced into the disc proper during larval development and this movement leads to Ubx repression.",2005,"Gerold Schubiger, Kimberly D McClure"
Drosophila GABA(B) receptors are involved in behavioral effects of gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB),16129424,10.1016/j.ejphar.2005.07.016,"Gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) can be synthesized in the brain but is also a known drug of abuse. Although putative GHB receptors have been cloned, it has been proposed that, similar to the behavior-impairing effects of ethanol, the in vivo effects of pharmacological GHB may involve metabotropic gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) GABA(B) receptors. We developed a fruitfly (Drosophila melanogater) model to investigate the role of these receptors in the behavioral effects of exogenous GHB. Injecting GHB into male flies produced a dose-dependent motor impairment (measured with a computer-assisted automated system), which was greater in ethanol-sensitive cheapdate mutants than in wild-type flies. These effects of pharmacological concentrations of GHB require the presence and activation of GABA(B) receptors. The evidence for this was obtained by pharmacological antagonism of GABA(B) receptors with CGP54626 and by RNA interference (RNAi)-induced knockdown of the GABA(B(1)) receptor subtype. Both procedures inhibited the behavioral effects of GHB. GHB pretreatment diminished the behavioral response to subsequent GHB injections; i.e., it triggered GHB tolerance, but did not produce ethanol tolerance. On the other hand, ethanol pretreatment produced both ethanol and GHB tolerance. It appears that in spite of many similarities between ethanol and GHB, the primary sites of their action may differ and that recently cloned putative GHB receptors may participate in actions of GHB that are not mediated by GABA(B) receptors. These receptors do not have a Drosophila orthologue. Whether Drosophila express a different GHB receptor should be explored.",2005,"Sevim Yildiz, Nikola Dimitrijevic, Marta Imbesi, Svetlana Dzitoyeva, Hari Manev, Rosalba Satta"
Rhodopsin maturation defects induce photoreceptor death by apoptosis: a fly model for RhodopsinPro23His human retinitis pigmentosa,16049034,10.1093/hmg/ddi258,"rhodopsin mutations result in autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (ADRP), the most frequent being Proline-23 substitution by histidine (RhoP23H). Although cellular and rodent animal models have been developed, the pathogenic mechanisms leading to RhoP23H-induced cell death are still poorly understood. For this, we have used a Drosophila model by introducing a mutation in the fly rhodopsin-1 gene (Rh1P37H) that corresponds to human RhoP23H. Rh1P37H transgenic flies show dominant photoreceptor degeneration that mimics age-, light-dependent and progressive ADRP. Moreover, we clarify the pathogenic mechanism of Rh1P37H mutation that acts as an antimorph. First, we show the dual-localization of mutant Rhodopsin since most of Rh1P37H accumulates in endoplasmic reticulum. Second, expression of mutant, mislocalized, Rhodopsin leads to cytotoxicity, via the activation of two stress-specific mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), p38 and JNK, which are known to control stress-induced apoptosis. In Rh1P37H flies, visual loss and degeneration are indeed accompanied by apoptotic features and prevented by expression of p35 apoptosis inhibitor. Finally, we show for the first time that properly localized, mutant, Rhodopsin is active. Thus, the development of a fly model that faithfully reproduces the human disease sheds light onto the molecular defects causing ADRP thereby making it possible to devise potential therapeutic approaches.",2005,"Angela Giangrande, Michel Joseph Roux, Anne Galy, José Alain Sahel, Thierry Léveillard"

Use of meixner functions in estimation of Volterra kernels of nonlinear systems with delay,15709660,10.1109/TBME.2004.840187,"Volterra series representation of nonlinear systems is a mathematical analysis tool that has been successfully applied in many areas of biological sciences, especially in the area of modeling of hemodynamic response. In this study, we explored the possibility of using discrete time Meixner basis functions (MBFs) in estimating Volterra kernels of nonlinear systems. The problem of estimation of Volterra kernels can be formulated as a multiple regression problem and solved using least squares estimation. By expanding system kernels with some suitable basis functions, it is possible to reduce the number of parameters to be estimated and obtain better kernel estimates. Thus far, Laguerre basis functions have been widely used in this framework. However, research in signal processing indicates that when the kernels have a slow initial onset or delay, Meixner functions, which can be made to have a slow start, are more suitable in terms of providing a more accurate approximation to the kernels. We, therefore, compared the performance of Meixner functions, in kernel estimation, to that of Laguerre functions in some test cases that we constructed and in a real experimental case where we studied photoreceptor responses of photoreceptor cells of adult fruitflies (Drosophila melanogaster). Our results indicate that when there is a slow initial onset or delay, MBF expansion provides better kernel estimates.",2005,"Musa H Asyali, Mikko Juusola"
Mechanisms of morphogen movement,16041758,10.1002/neu.20164,"Morphogens are defined as signaling molecules that are produced locally, yet act directly at a distance to pattern the surrounding field of cells in a concentration-dependent manner. In recent years many laboratories have devoted their attention to how morphogens actually reach distant cells. Several models have been proposed, including diffusion in the extracellular space and planar transcytosis. A combination of genetic, developmental, and cell-biological approaches have been taken to tackle this issue. I will present the models and discuss the types of experiments that have been designed to test them. It stands out that most of the work has been carried out in Drosophila. Morphogens contribute to patterning of the vertebrate nervous system, and the same signaling molecules have recently been shown to play important, possibly instructive, roles in axon guidance. Little, if anything, is known about the movement of morphogens in the context of nervous system development.

moody encodes two GPCRs that regulate cocaine behaviors and blood-brain barrier permeability in Drosophila,16213219,10.1016/j.cell.2005.07.029,"We identified moody in a genetic screen for Drosophila mutants with altered cocaine sensitivity. Hypomorphic mutations in moody cause an increased sensitivity to cocaine and nicotine exposure. In contrast, sensitivity to the acute intoxicating effects of ethanol is reduced. The moody locus encodes two novel GPCRs, Moody-alpha and Moody-beta. While identical in their membrane-spanning domains, the two Moody proteins differ in their long carboxy-terminal domains, which are generated by use of alternative reading frames. Both Moody forms are required for normal cocaine sensitivity, suggesting that they carry out distinct but complementary functions. Moody-alpha and Moody-beta are coexpressed in surface glia that surround the nervous system, where they are actively required to maintain the integrity of the blood-brain barrier in the adult fly. We propose that a Moody-mediated signaling pathway functions in glia to regulate nervous system insulation and drug-related behaviors.",2005,"Ulrike Heberlein, Linus T-Y Tsai, Roland J Bainton, Ulrike Gaul, Michael DeSalvo, Tina Schwabe"

Repeat mediated gene duplication in the Drosophila pseudoobscura genome,19272434,10.1016/j.gene.2009.02.019,"Genetic mutations can occur on a wide variety of scales, including those that change single nucleotides, those that add or remove content to/from a genome, and those that change the organization of a genome. Gene duplications are a specific class of mutations that add content to a genome, and they can arise via a wide variety of mechanisms. I examined the mechanisms responsible for recently duplicated genes in the D. pseudoobscura genome, and I observed both retroposed and DNA duplications. Many duplicated genes lack signatures of either retroposition or DNA-based mechanisms, but other features of these ambiguously duplicated genes suggest that most were generated via retroposition. Furthermore, close examination of sequences flanking DNA duplications and those found at the breakpoints of chromosomal inversions suggests a connection between these two events. In Drosophila, duplicated genes near inversion breakpoints can arise via unequal genetic exchange during the non-allelic crossing over event giving rise to the inversion. I observed one duplicated gene in the D. pseudoobscura genome that appears to have been generated by this mechanism. Additionally, many DNA duplications in the D. pseudoobscura genome are flanked by a repetitive sequence also found at the breakpoints of chromosomal inversions.

Targeting of Drosophila rhodopsin requires helix 8 but not the distal C-terminus,19572012,10.1371/journal.pone.0006101,"Background: The fundamental role of the light receptor rhodopsin in visual function and photoreceptor cell development has been widely studied. Proper trafficking of rhodopsin to the photoreceptor membrane is of great importance. In human, mutations in rhodopsin involving its intracellular mislocalization, are the most frequent cause of autosomal dominant Retinitis Pigmentosa, a degenerative retinal pathology characterized by progressive blindness. Drosophila is widely used as an animal model in visual and retinal degeneration research. So far, little is known about the requirements for proper rhodopsin targeting in Drosophila. Methodology/principal findings: Different truncated fly-rhodopsin Rh1 variants were expressed in the eyes of Drosophila and their localization was analyzed in vivo or by immunofluorescence. A mutant lacking the last 23 amino acids was found to properly localize in the rhabdomeres, the light-sensing organelle of the photoreceptor cells. This constitutes a major difference to trafficking in vertebrates, which involves a conserved QVxPA motif at the very C-terminus. Further truncations of Rh1 indicated that proper localization requires the last amino acid residues of a region called helix 8 following directly the last transmembrane domain. Interestingly, the very C-terminus of invertebrate visual rhodopsins is extremely variable but helix 8 shows conserved amino acid residues that are not conserved in vertebrate homologs. Conclusions/significance: Despite impressive similarities in the folding and photoactivation of vertebrate and invertebrate visual rhodopsins, a striking difference exists between mammalian and fly rhodopsins in their requirements for proper targeting. Most importantly, the distal part of helix 8 plays a central role in invertebrates. Since the last amino acid residues of helix 8 are dispensable for rhodopsin folding and function, we propose that this domain participates in the recognition of targeting factors involved in transport to the rhabdomeres.",2009,"Natalia A Bulgakova, Elisabeth Knust, Irmgard Sinning, Valérie Panneels, Ines Kock"

Extension of Drosophila life span by RNAi of the mitochondrial respiratory chain,19747824,10.1016/j.cub.2009.08.016,"Background: Mitochondria have long been proposed to play an important role in the aging process. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, genes important for mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) function stand out as a principal group of genes affecting life span. However, it has been suggested that this may be a peculiarity of nematode biology. In the present study, we have used an in vivo RNA interference (RNAi) strategy to inactivate ETC genes in Drosophila melanogaster and examine the impact on longevity. Results: Here, we report that RNAi of five genes encoding components of mitochondrial respiratory complexes I, III, IV, and V leads to increased life span in flies. Long-lived flies with reduced expression of ETC genes do not consistently show reduced assembly of respiratory complexes or reduced ATP levels. In addition, extended longevity is not consistently correlated with reduced fertility or increased resistance to the free-radical generator paraquat. Targeted RNAi of two complex I genes in adult tissues or in neurons alone is sufficient to extend life span. Conclusions: Our data suggest that the role of mitochondrial ETC function in modulating animal aging is evolutionarily conserved and might also operate in humans. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the longer life span of flies with reduced ETC gene expression cannot simply be attributed to reduced energy production leading to decreased ""rate of living.""",2009,"David W Walker, Jae H Hur, Sepehr Bahadorani, Thomas Lo Jr, Jeffrey M Copeland, Jason Rabie, Tagui Arabyan, Jennifer Soh, Jaehyoung Cho"

The various results suggest that hydrophobic clusters as well as different native and non-native secondary structural elements are transiently formed. The backbone in the regions Gln26-Lys31 and Gly47-Gln60 shows conformationally restricted motions. The AABUF profile of the sequence reflected that this region has the highest tendency to undergo hydrophobic clustering and may thus assist the formation of transient structures. The secondary chemical shifts and coupling constants indicated that this region has strong tendency to occupy the broad beta-domain of (phi,psi) space. A number of NMR parameters indicated that the region Asp58-Gln60 (corresponding to beta3-beta4 turn in the folded state) has residual turn-like structure.

Toxicological responses of red-backed salamanders (Plethodon cinereus) to soil exposures of copper,18825446,10.1007/s00244-008-9232-4,"Copper (Cu) has widespread military use in munitions and small arms, particularly as a protective jacket for lead projectiles.

We found that mutations of two genes, Hyperkinetic (Hk) and glutathione S-transferase-S1 (gsts1), alter the response to social isolation in Drosophila. Hk and gsts1 mutations increased adult female aggression and larval neuromuscular hyperexcitability, even when reared in a group. Unlike wild type, these behavioral and electrophysiological phenotypes were not further enhanced in these mutants by isolated rearing. Products of these two genes have been implicated in reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism. We previously reported in these mutants increased signals from an ROS probe at larval NMJs, and this study revealed distinct effects of isolation rearing on these mutants, compared to the control larvae in ROS-probe signals. Our data further demonstrated modified nerve and muscle excitability by a reducing agent, dithiothreitol. Our results suggest that altered cellular ROS regulation can exert pleiotropic effects on nerve, synapse, and muscle functions and may involve different redox mechanisms in different cell types to modify behavioral expressions. Therefore, ROS regulation may take part in the cellular responses to social isolation stress, underlying an important form of neural and behavioral plasticity.",2009,"Chun-Fang Wu, Atsushi Ueda"
"IscR modulates catalase A (KatA) activity, peroxide resistance and full virulence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14",20075613,10.4014/jmb.0906.06028,"We have identified the iscR (PA3815) gene encoding an iron-sulfur cluster assembly regulator homologue as one of the genes required for peroxide resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14. Here, we present the phenotypic characterization of an iscR deletion mutant in terms of KatA expression, stress responses, and virulence. The iscR null mutant exhibited reduced KatA activity at the posttranslational level, hypersensitivity to hydrogen peroxide, and virulence-attenuation in Drosophila melanogaster and mouse peritonitis models. These phenotypes were fully restored by multi-copy-based expression of katA. These results suggest that the requirement of IscR in P. aeruginosa is related to the proper activity of KatA, which is crucial for peroxide resistance and full virulence of this bacterium.",2009,"Bo-Young Lee, Seol-Hee Kim, You-Hee Cho, Gee W Lau"
Follow the mRNA: a new model for Bicoid gradient formation,19626044,10.1038/nrm2730,"Morphogens are molecules that specify cell fate in a concentration-dependent manner. A classic example is the Bicoid (BCD) protein, for which the prevailing model is that translation of bcd mRNA occurs from a point source at the anterior pole of the Drosophila melanogaster embryo followed by diffusion to produce a protein gradient. This model has been challenged by experiments showing that the diffusion rate of BCD is too slow to establish the protein gradient. The work described in a recent paper has solved this conundrum by demonstrating that a bcd mRNA gradient prefigures the BCD protein gradient.",2009,Howard D Lipshitz
Mechanisms of growth and homeostasis in the Drosophila wing,19575645,10.1146/annurev.cellbio.24.110707.175242,"Animal shape and size is controlled with amazing precision during development. External factors such as nutrient availability and crowding can alter overall animal size, but individual body parts scale reproducibly to match the body even with challenges from a changing environment. How is such precision achieved? Here, we review selected research from the last few years in Drosophila--arguably the premier genetic model for the study of animal growth--that sheds light on how body and tissue size are regulated by forces intrinsic to individual organs.

Alternative exon 9-encoded relay domains affect more than one communication pathway in the Drosophila myosin head,19393244,10.1016/j.jmb.2009.04.036,"We investigated the biochemical and biophysical properties of one of the four alternative regions within the Drosophila myosin catalytic domain: the relay domain encoded by exon 9. This domain of the myosin head transmits conformational changes in the nucleotide-binding pocket to the converter domain, which is crucial to coupling catalytic activity with mechanical movement of the lever arm. To study the function of this region, we used chimeric myosins (IFI-9b and EMB-9a), which were generated by exchange of the exon 9-encoded domains between the native embryonic body wall (EMB) and indirect flight muscle isoforms (IFI). Kinetic measurements show that exchange of the exon 9-encoded region alters the kinetic properties of the myosin S1 head. This is reflected in reduced values for ATP-induced actomyosin dissociation rate constant (K(1)k(+2)) and ADP affinity (K(AD)), measured for the chimeric constructs IFI-9b and EMB-9a, compared to wild-type IFI and EMB values. Homology models indicate that, in addition to affecting the communication pathway between the nucleotide-binding pocket and the converter domain, exchange of the relay domains between IFI and EMB affects the communication pathway between the nucleotide-binding pocket and the actin-binding site in the lower 50-kDa domain (loop 2). These results suggest an important role of the relay domain in the regulation of actomyosin cross-bridge kinetics.",2009,"Aileen F Knowles, Michael A Geeves, Sanford I Bernstein, Corey M Dambacher, Girish C Melkani, Marieke J Bloemink"
The Him gene inhibits the development of Drosophila flight muscles during metamorphosis,19324085,10.1016/j.mod.2009.03.003,"During Drosophila metamorphosis some larval tissues escape the general histolysis and are remodelled to form adult tissues. One example is the dorso-longitudinal muscles (DLMs) of the indirect flight musculature. They are formed by an intriguing process in which residual larval oblique muscles (LOMs) split and fuse with imaginal myoblasts associated with the wing disc. These myoblasts arise in the embryo, but remain undifferentiated throughout embryogenesis and larval life, and thus share characteristics with mammalian satellite cells. However, the mechanisms that maintain the Drosophila myoblasts in an undifferentiated state until needed for LOM remodelling are not understood. Here we show that the Him gene is expressed in these myoblasts, but is undetectable in developing DLM fibres. Consistent with this, we found that Him could inhibit DLM development: it inhibited LOM splitting and resulted in fibre degeneration. We then uncovered a balance between mef2, a positive factor required for proper DLM development, and the inhibitory action of Him. Mef2 suppressed the inhibitory effect of Him on DLM development, while Him could suppress the premature myosin expression induced by mef2 in myoblasts. Furthermore, either decreased Him function or increased mef2 function disrupted DLM development. These findings, together with the co-expression of Him and Mef2 in myoblasts, indicate that Him may antagonise mef2 function during normal DLM development and that Him participates in a balance of signals that controls adult myoblast differentiation and remodelling of these muscle fibres. Lastly, we provide evidence for a link between Notch function and Him and mef2 in this balance.",2009,"Cédric Soler, Michael V Taylor"

Coordinated regulation of heterochromatic genes in Drosophila melanogaster males,19307603,10.1534/genetics.109.102087,"Dosage compensation modifies the chromatin of X-linked genes to assure equivalent expression in sexes with unequal X chromosome dosage. In Drosophila dosage compensation is achieved by increasing expression from the male X chromosome. The ribonucleoprotein dosage compensation complex (DCC) binds hundreds of sites along the X chromosome and modifies chromatin to facilitate transcription. Loss of roX RNA, an essential component of the DCC, reduces expression from X-linked genes. Surprisingly, loss of roX RNA also reduces expression from genes situated in proximal heterochromatin and on the small, heterochromatic fourth chromosome. Mutation of some, but not all, of the genes encoding DCC proteins produces a similar effect. Reduction of roX function suppresses position effect variegation (PEV), revealing functional alteration in heterochromatin. The effects of roX mutations on heterochromatic gene expression and PEV are limited to males. A sex-limited role for the roX RNAs in autosomal gene expression was unexpected. We propose that this reflects a difference in the heterochromatin of males and females, which serves to accommodate the heterochromatic Y chromosome present in the male nucleus. roX transcripts may thus participate in two distinct regulatory systems that have evolved in response to highly differentiated sex chromosomes: compensation of X-linked gene dosage and modulation of heterochromatin.",2009,"Victoria H Meller, Ying Kong, S Kiran Koya, Xinxian Deng"
The hobo transposon and hobo-related elements are expressed as developmental genes in Drosophila,19720121,10.1016/j.gene.2009.08.012,"Transposable elements comprise a significant part of genomes and are involved in their evolvability. The hobo element is found as an active class II transposable element in Drosophila melanogaster that is able to induce gonadal dysgenesis. Some hobo-related sequences (hRSs) are thought to be relics of old ""hobo"" invasions, and are therefore ancient genomic constituents. However, some of these hRSs are still mobile. The present study analyzed the expression pattern of hobo and a particular type of hRSs, hobo(VAHS). Both elements were shown to be expressed as sense and antisense mRNA transcripts. Expression analysis in whole mount embryos revealed a pattern similar to that of some developmental regulatory genes. Here we suggest that cis-regulatory sequences similar to those in developmental genes exist in hobo sequences.

Drosophila KDM2 is a H3K4me3 demethylase regulating nucleolar organization,19852816,10.1186/1756-0500-2-217,"Background: CG11033 (dKDM2) is the Drosophila homolog of the gene KDM2B. dKDM2 has been known to possess histone lysine demethylase activity towards H3K36me2 in cell lines and it regulates H2A ubiquitination. The human homolog of the gene has dual activity towards H3K36me2 as well as H3K4me3, and plays an important role in cellular senescence. Findings: We have used transgenic flies bearing an RNAi construct for the dKDM2 gene. The knockdown of dKDM2 gene was performed by crossing UAS-RNAi-dKDM2 flies with actin-Gal4 flies. Western blots of acid extracted histones and immunofluoresence analysis of polytene chromosome showed the activity of the enzyme dKDM2 to be specific for H3K4me3 in adult flies. Immunofluoresence analysis of polytene chromosome also revealed the presence of multiple nucleoli in RNAi knockdown mutants of dKDM2 and decreased H3-acetylation marks associated with active transcription.

Drosophila expresses a CD98 transporter with an evolutionarily conserved structure and amino acid-transport properties,19335336,10.1042/BJ20082198,"Mammalian CD98 heterodimeric amino acid transporters consist of a promiscuous single-pass transmembrane glycoprotein, CD98hc (CD98 heavy chain), and one of six multipass transmembrane proteins or 'light chains'. The heterodimeric complexes of CD98hc and the light chains LAT1 (L-type amino acid transporter 1) or LAT2 specifically promote sodium-independent System L exchange of neutral amino acids, including leucine. CD98hc is also implicated in other processes, including cell fusion, cell adhesion and activation of TOR (target of rapamycin) signalling. Surprisingly, recent reports suggested that insects lack a membrane-bound CD98hc, but in the present study we show that Drosophila CG2791 encodes a functional CD98hc orthologue with conservation in intracellular, transmembrane and extracellular domains. We demonstrate by RNA-interference knockdown in Drosophila Schneider cells that CG2791 and two Drosophila homologues of the mammalian CD98 light chains, Mnd (Minidiscs) and JhI-21, are required for normal levels of System L transport. Furthermore, we show that System L activity is increased by methoprene, an analogue of the developmentally regulated endocrine hormone juvenile hormone, an effect that is potentially mediated by elevated Mnd expression. Co-expression of CG2791 and JhI-21, but not CG2791 and Mnd, in Xenopus oocytes mediates System L transport. Finally, mapping of conserved sequences on to the recently determined crystal structure of the human CD98hc extracellular domain highlights two conserved exposed hydrophobic patches at either end of the domain that are potential protein-protein-interaction surfaces. Therefore our results not only show that there is functional conservation of CD98hc System L transporters in flies, but also provide new insights into the structure, functions and regulation of heterodimeric amino acid transporters.",2009,"C A Richard Boyd, Shubana Kazi, Robert Laynes, Pietro Roversi, Deborah C I Goberdhan, Bruno Reynolds"
"Smelling, tasting, learning: Drosophila as a study case",19145411,10.1007/400_2008_9,"Understanding brain function is to account for how the sensory system is integrated with the organism's needs to organize behaviour. We review what is known about these processes with regard to chemosensation and chemosensory learning in Drosophila. We stress that taste and olfaction are organized rather differently. Given that, e.g., sugars are nutrients and should be eaten (irrespective of the kind of sugar) and that toxic substances should be avoided (regardless of the kind of death they eventually cause), tastants are classified into relatively few behavioural matters of concern. In contrast, what needs to be done in response to odours is less evolutionarily determined. Thus, discrimination ability is warranted between different kinds of olfactory input, as any difference between odours may potentially be or become important. Therefore, the olfactory system has a higher dimensionality than gustation, and allows for more sensory-motor flexibility to attach acquired behavioural 'meaning' to odours. We argue that, by and large, larval and adult Drosophila are similar in these kinds of architecture, and that additionally there are a number of similarities to vertebrates, in particular regarding the cellular architecture of the olfactory pathway, the functional slant of the taste and smell systems towards classification versus discrimination, respectively, and the higher plasticity of the olfactory sensory-motor system. From our point of view, the greatest gap in understanding smell and taste systems to date is not on the sensory side, where indeed impressive advances have been achieved; also, a satisfying account of associative odour-taste memory trace formation seems within reach. Rather, we lack an understanding as to how sensory and motor formats of processing are centrally integrated, and how adaptive motor patterns actually are selected. Such an understanding, we believe, will allow the analysis to be extended to the motivating factors of behaviour, eventually leading to a comprehensive account of those systems which make Drosophila do what Drosophila's got to do.",2009,"A S Thum, B Gerber, T Tanimura, R F Stocker"
The novel regulator of metazoan development SAYP organizes a nuclear coactivator supercomplex,19556896,10.4161/cc.8.14.9115,"SAYP is a dual-function transcription coactivator of RNA polymerase II.

SAYP is abundant in many embryonic tissues and imaginal discs in larvae and is crucial for oogenesis in adults. PHF10 is a mammalian homologue of SAYP whose expression is confined to certain tissues in adults.

Oriented cell division as a response to cell death and cell competition,19853449,10.1016/j.cub.2009.09.023,"The imaginal disc epithelia that give rise to the adult ectoderm of Drosophila can compensate to produce normal adult organs after damage. We looked at the local response to cell death by using two genetic methods to elevate cell death rates. During cell competition, sporadic cell death occurs predictably along the boundaries between populations of competing wild-type and ""Minute"" cells (M/+). Boundaries between M/+ and wild-type populations show an unusual degree of mixing, associated with mitotic reorientation of wild-type cells toward M/+ territory that they take over. Apoptosis of M/+ cells was the cue, and reoriented mitosis required the planar cell polarity genes dachsous, fat, and atrophin. Clones mutated for pineapple eye, an essential gene, elevate apoptosis by a noncompetitive mechanism. Mitosis was also reoriented near cells mutant for pineapple eye, likewise dependent on the planar cell polarity genes. These findings show that planar cell polarity genes are required for responses to cell death. Oriented mitosis may help maintain morphology as dividing cells replace those that have been lost.",2009,"Wei Li, Abhijit Kale, Nicholas E Baker"
Molecular evolution of the Cecropin multigene family in Drosophila. functional genes vs. pseudogenes,9725836,,"Approximately 4 kb of the Cecropin cluster region have been sequenced in nine lines of Drosophila melanogaster and one line of the sibling species D. simulans, D. mauritiana, and D. sechellia. This region includes three functional genes (CecA1, CecA2, and CecB), which are involved in the insect immune response, and two pseudogenes (CecPsi1 and CecPsi2). The level of silent polymorphism in the three Cec genes is rather high (0.028), and there is no excess of nonsynonymous polymorphism. There is no evidence of gene conversion in the history of these genes. The interspecific comparison has revealed that in the three species of the simulans cluster the CecA2 gene is partially deleted and has therefore lost its function and become a pseudogene; in each of the species, subsequent deletions have accumulated. Divergence estimates indicate that the CecPsi1 and CecPsi2 pseudogenes are highly diverged, both between themselves and relative to the other three Cec genes. However, both CecPsi1 and CecPsi2 have conserved transcriptional signals and splice sites, and they present an open reading frame; also, correctly spliced transcripts have been detected for both CecPsi1 and CecPsi2.

In vivo analyses of cytoplasmic transport and cytoskeletal organization during Drosophila oogenesis: characterization of a multi-step anterior localization pathway,9716531,,"Anterior patterning of the Drosophila embryo depends on localization of bicoid (bcd) mRNA to the anterior pole of the developing oocyte, and bcd mRNA localization requires both the exuperantia (exu) gene and an intact microtubule cytoskeleton. To gain insight into the mechanism of anterior patterning, we have used time lapse laser scanning confocal microscopy to analyze transport of particles containing a Green Fluorescent Protein-Exu fusion (GFP-Exu), and to directly image microtubule organization in vivo. Our observations indicate that microtubules are required for three forms of particle movement within the nurse cells, while transport through the ring canals linking the nurse cells and oocyte appears to be independent of both microtubules and actin filaments. As particles enter the oocyte, a final microtubule-dependent step directs movement to the oocyte cortex. However, our observations and previous studies suggest that the polarity of the oocyte microtubule network is not in itself sufficient to generate anterior asymmetry, and that additional factors are required to restrict morphogens to the anterior pole. Based on these observations, we propose a multi-step anterior localization pathway.",1998,"W E Theurkauf, T I Hazelrigg"
Dual functions of the heartless fibroblast growth factor receptor in development of the Drosophila embryonic mesoderm,9621429,10.1002/(SICI)1520-6408(1998)22:3<212::AID-DVG4>3.0.CO;2-9,"The Drosophila embryonic mesoderm forms by invagination of the ventral-most blastoderm cells. Subsequent development of this germ layer involves the dorsolateral migration of the internalized cells and expansion by cell division, followed by the specification of particular cell fates through the coordinate actions of both intrinsic and extrinsic regulatory mechanisms. The latter include several intercellular signals that function across germ layers. These processes combine to generate a diversity of mesodermal sub-types, including the cardial and pericardial cells of the heart or dorsal vessel, a complete set of somatic muscle founders each with its unique identity, a population of cells that form the visceral musculature, and other cells that develop into hemocytes and the fat body. Here, we review recent evidence for the involvement of a fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) encoded by the heartless (htl) gene in early directional migration of the Drosophila mesoderm. In addition, we provide new data that 1) demonstrate a second role for Htl in promoting the specification of the precursors to certain cardiac and somatic muscle cells in the Drosophila embryo, independent of its cell migration function, 2) suggest that Ras and at least one other signal transduction pathway act downstream of Htl, and 3) establish a functional relationship between the Ras pathway and Tinman (Tin), a homeodomain factor that is essential for specifying some of the same dorsal mesodermal cells that are dependent on Htl.

Second-site noncomplementation identifies genomic regions required for Drosophila nonmuscle myosin function during morphogenesis,9560399,,"Drosophila is an ideal metazoan model system for analyzing the role of nonmuscle myosin-II (henceforth, myosin) during development. In Drosophila, myosin function is required for cytokinesis and morphogenesis driven by cell migration and/or cell shape changes during oogenesis, embryogenesis, larval development and pupal metamorphosis. The mechanisms that regulate myosin function and the supramolecular structures into which myosin incorporates have not been systematically characterized. The genetic screens described here identify genomic regions that uncover loci that facilitate myosin function. The nonmuscle myosin heavy chain is encoded by a single locus, zipper. Contiguous chromosomal deficiencies that represent approximately 70% of the euchromatic genome were screened for genetic interactions with two recessive lethal alleles of zipper in a second-site noncomplementation assay for the malformed phenotype. Malformation in the adult leg reflects aberrations in cell shape changes driven by myosin-based contraction during leg morphogenesis. Of the 158 deficiencies tested, 47 behaved as second-site noncomplementors of zipper. Two of the deficiencies are strong interactors, 17 are intermediate and 28 are weak. Finer genetic mapping reveals that mutations in cytoplasmic tropomyosin and viking (collagen IV) behave as second-site noncomplementors of zipper during leg morphogenesis and that zipper function requires a previously uncharacterized locus, E3.10/J3.8, for leg morphogenesis and viability.",1998,"S R Halsell, D P Kiehart"

Expression pattern of a butterfly achaete-scute homolog reveals the homology of butterfly wing scales and insect sensory bristles,9663389,10.1016/s0960-9822(98)70322-7,"Background: Lepidopteran wing scales are the individual units of wing color patterns and were a key innovation during Lepidopteran evolution. On the basis of developmental and morphological evidence, it has been proposed that the sensory bristles of the insect peripheral nervous system and the wing scales of Lepidoptera are homologous structures. In order to determine if the developmental pathways leading to Drosophila sensory bristle and butterfly scale formation use similar genetic circuitry, we cloned, from the butterfly Precis coenia, a homolog of the Drosophila achaete-scute (AS-C) genes--which encode transcription factors that promote neural precursor formation--and examined its expression pattern during development. Results: During embryonic and larval development, the expression pattern of the AS-C homolog, ASH1, forecasted neural precursor formation. ASH1 was expressed both in embryonic proneural clusters--within which an individual cell retained ASH1 expression, enlarged, segregated, and became a neural precursor--and in larval wing discs in putative sensory mother cells. ASH1 was also expressed in pupal wings, however, in evenly spaced rows of enlarged cells that had segregated from the underlying epidermis but, rather than give rise to neural structures, each cell contributed to an individual scale. Conclusions: ASH1 appears to perform multiple functions throughout butterfly development, apparently promoting the initial events of selection and formation of both neural and scale precursor cells. The similarity in the cellular and molecular processes of scale and neural precursor formation suggests that the spatial regulation of an AS-C gene was modified during Lepidopteran evolution to promote scale cell formation.",1998,"S Paddock, R Galant, J B Skeath, D L Lewis, S B Carroll"

Otx2 null mice die early in development and fail in specification of the rostral neuroectoderm and proper gastrulation. In order to determine whether Otx1(-/- )and Otx2(-/-) highly divergent phenotypes reflect differences in temporal expression or biochemical activity of OTX1 and OTX2 proteins, the Otx2-coding sequence was replaced by a human Otx1 full-coding cDNA. Homozygous mutant embryos recovered anterior neural plate and proper gastrulation but failed to maintain forebrain-midbrain identities, displaying a headless phenotype from 9 days post coitum (d.p.c.) onwards. Unexpectedly, in spite of the RNA distribution in both visceral endoderm (VE) and epiblast, the hOTX1 protein was synthesized only in the VE. This VE-restricted translation was sufficient to recover Otx2 requirements for specification of the anterior neural plate and proper organization of the primitive streak, thus providing evidence that the difference between Otx1 and Otx2 null mice phenotypes originates from their divergent expression patterns. Moreover, our data lead us to hypothesize that the differential post-transcriptional control existing between VE and epiblast cells may potentially contribute to fundamental regulatory mechanisms required for head specification.",1998,"A Simeone, D Acampora, V Avantaggiato, F Tuorto, G Corte, P Briata"

Unexpectedly, there is a strong conservation of 5' and 3' flanking regions between Amyrel genes from different species, which is not the case for Amy and which suggests that selection acts on these regions. In contrast to the Amy genes, Amyrel is transcribed in larvae of D. melanogaster but not in adults. However, the protein has not been detected yet.

Amongst other regulatory elements, Puckered, a Drosophila MAPK phosphatase, is involved in a negative feedback loop that controls JNK signaling activity. puckered is expressed in many other tissues, could influence other developmental events and might regulate different signaling cascades. The negative regulatory control of signal transduction pathways could be a general mechanism regulating differentiation and morphogenesis.",1998,E Martín-Blanco
Chromatin structure in bands and interbands of polytene chromosomes imaged by atomic force microscopy,9573615,10.1006/jsbi.1997.3929,"Polytene chromosomes from Drosophila melanogaster, observed from squash preparations, and chromosomes from Chironomus thummi thummi, investigated under physiological conditions, are imaged using an Atomic Force Microscope.

Unfixed chromosomes can be imaged in buffer and show less fiber-like details because of the inherent soft nature of the chromatin material.",1998,"C Otto, K O vd Werf, D J van den Heuvel, C J de Grauw, Y Kraan, N F van Hulst, A Avogadro, J Greve"
A genetic deficiency that spans the flightin gene of Drosophila melanogaster affects the ultrastructure and function of the flight muscles,9622575,,"We have developed a reverse-genetic approach to study the function of flightin, a unique protein of the flight muscle myofibril of Drosophila melanogaster. We describe the generation and characterization of Df(3L)fln1, a lethal genetic deficiency in the 76BE region of the third chromosome which deletes several genes, including the gene for flightin. We show that heterozygous flies harboring the Df(3L)fln1 mutation exhibit both impaired flight and ultrastructural defects in their flight muscle myofibrils. We found that the mutation does not interfere with assembly of the myofibril but leads to disorganization of peripheral myofilaments in adult myofibrils. Most myofibrils, nevertheless, retain an intact core that represents approximately 80 % of the normal lattice diameter. Mechanical analysis of single skinned flight muscle fibers demonstrates that the mutation has no significant effect on net power output but increases the frequency at which maximum power is delivered to the wings, potentially reducing the overall performance of the flight system. The results suggest that flightin is an indispensable part of the flight muscle contractile mechanism.",1998,"D Maughan, J Moore, G Ayer, C Hernandez, J O Vigoreaux"
The Drosophila gene asteroid encodes a novel protein and displays dosage-sensitive interactions with Star and Egfr,9644838,10.1139/g98-021,"The asteroid gene of Drosophila was found to lie within 189 bp of Star. Asteroid cDNA clones were isolated and sequenced and a single putative open reading frame was identified that encodes a novel protein of 815 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 93 kilodaltons. Using cDNA probes, asteroid transcripts were localized to the proliferative tissues of embryos and to the mitotically active tissue anterior to the morphogenetic furrow in eye imaginal discs. Ribonuclease protection assays identified a mutation of asteroid that acts as a dominant enhancer of Star mutations and also enhances the Ellipse mutation, EgfrE1. Based on these data, a model for asteroid gene function in EGF receptor signaling is presented.",1998,"S A Sedore, D A Leonard, M A Kotarski, S D Wahn, C P Bishop, S A Bennett, M Shrader"
"A genetic screen for modifiers of Drosophila decapentaplegic signaling identifies mutations in punt, Mothers against dpp and the BMP-7 homologue, 60A",9521913,,"decapentaplegic (dpp) is a Transforming Growth Factor beta (TGF-beta)-related growth factor that controls multiple developmental processes in Drosophila. To identify components involved in dpp signaling, we carried out a genetic screen for dominant enhancer mutations of a hypomorphic allele of thick veins (tkv), a type I receptor for dpp. We recovered new alleles of tkv, punt, Mothers against dpp (Mad) and Medea (Med), all of which are known to mediate dpp signaling. We also recovered mutations in the 60A gene which encodes another TGF-beta-related factor in Drosophila. DNA sequence analysis established that all three 60A alleles were nonsense mutations in the prodomain of the 60A polypeptide. These mutations in 60A caused defects in midgut morphogenesis and fat body differentiation. We present evidence that when dpp signaling is compromised, lowering the level of 60A impairs several dpp-dependent developmental processes examined, including the patterning of the visceral mesoderm, the embryonic ectoderm and the imaginal discs. These results provide the first in vivo evidence for the involvement of 60A in the dpp pathway. We propose that 60A activity is required to maintain optimal signaling capacity of the dpp pathway, possibly by forming biologically active heterodimers with Dpp proteins.",1998,"Y Chen, M J Riese, F M Hoffmann, M A Killinger"
Drosophila clipper/CPSF 30K is a post-transcriptionally regulated nuclear protein that binds RNA containing GC clusters,9512528,10.1093/nar/26.7.1597,"An essential component of the mammalian pre-mRNA 3'-end processing machinery is a multimeric protein complex known as cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF). The Drosophila melanogaster gene, clipper ( clp ), encodes a homolog of the CPSF 30K subunit. We have shown previously that CLP possesses N-terminal endoribonucleolytic activity and that the relative expression of its mRNA fluctuates during fly development. In the present study, we report that CLP's C-terminus, containing two CCHC zinc knuckles, confers a binding preference for RNAs that contain G- and/or C-rich clusters. We also show, for the first time, that a member of the highly conserved CPSF 30K family is a nuclear and developmentally regulated protein. Though clp transcripts are detectable throughout embryogenesis, CLP protein is not present. We demonstrate that post-transcriptional regulation of clp mRNA in the embryo occurs by a process that does not involve poly(A) tail length shortening. Thus, a key component of the pre-mRNA 3'-end processing machinery is subject to post-transcriptional regulation during development. These results support the existence of a distinct mechanism controlling eukaryotic gene expression through the regulated processing of pre-mRNAs in the nucleus.",1998,"C Bai, P P Tolias"
Wnt signaling stabilizes the dual-function protein beta-catenin in diverse cell types,9917831,10.1111/j.1749-6632.1998.tb10106.x,"The Wnt proteins constitute a large family of secreted signaling factors that performed a wide variety of inductive and regulatory functions in embryonic and postnatal development. In mammals, these include crucial roles in morphogenesis of the central nervous system, kidneys, limbs, and mammary glands. In recent years, much progress has been made in identifying components of the intracellular Wnt-1 signal transduction pathway through studies in Drosophila, C. elegans, Xenopus, and mammalian systems. Several features of this pathway are remarkably well conserved in evolution. A key component of the Wnt pathway is the cytoplasmic protein beta-catenin, whose stability is increased as a result of Wnt signaling. Although morphological effects of Wnt-1 in cell culture are seen in only a limited number of cell lines, we show here that responsiveness to Wnt-1 at the biochemical level is a common property of both epithelial and mesenchymal cells. The increased abundance of beta-catenin may have at least two functional consequences, depending on the subcellular localization of the protein. In some cell lines that respond to Wnt-1, there is a significant increase in the beta-catenin fraction associated with the plasma membrane, where the protein acts as a component of cell-cell adhesive junctions. In other cell types, the major effect of Wnt signaling is an increase in the cytosolic pool of beta-catenin. Increased abundance of this pool has recently been correlated with entry of beta-catenin into the nucleus, where the protein forms complexes with Tcf transcription factors and is thought to modulate the expression of specific genes. The dual consequences of Wnt signaling on cell adhesion and/or gene expression provide at least two potential mechanisms by which this key pathway can function in the regulation of morphogenesis.",1998,"A M Brown, M Giarré, M V Semënov"
Cloning of a cDNA encoding an Artemia franciscana Na/K ATPase alpha-subunit,1657719,10.1016/0378-1119(91)90151-z,"Clones of cDNA that code for an isoform of the Artemia franciscana Na/K ATPase alpha subunit (NaKA alpha) have been isolated. The sequence of the longest of these clones (pArATNa136) is 3595 nucleotides; it codes for a 1004-amino acid protein whose sequence is identical to that of two previously sequenced Artemia NaKA alpha peptides. The encoded protein is over 73% identical to Drosophila melanogaster and vertebrate NaKA alpha s, and 73.8% identical to another Artemia NaKA alpha isoform previously described (named alpha 2850 in this article). The two Artemia cDNA clones code for mRNAs of different size; the clone pArATNa136 codes for a 4.5-kb mRNA while the alpha 2850 clone codes for a 3.6-kb mRNA. The degree of homology and the different size of the mRNAs encoded by both cDNAs suggest that they code for two different isoforms of the protein.",1991,"M T Macías, L Sastre, I Palmero"
Analysis of the molecular mechanisms for the species-specific transcription of Drosophila and human tRNA gene transcription components,1874746,,"The transcription of eucaryotic tRNA genes requires two factors IIIB and IIIC, in addition to RNA polymerase III, to reconstitute this process in vitro. We have examined the functional exchangeability of these components from Drosophila and human systems. The reconstitution of heterologous IIIB and IIIC components demonstrated that neither factor will functionally substitute for the homologous components to activate tRNA gene transcription. The addition of the heterologous Drosophila factors to HeLa transcription assays causes an inhibition of RNA synthesis that is dependent upon the order of addition of these proteins to the DNA template. Thus, it appears that tRNA gene transcription in these systems is species-specific. We have further analyzed the reason for the apparent incompatibilities of these components by the use of stable complex formation assays. We find that human HeLa IIIB and Drosophila IIIC are unable to form stably associated complexes with a tRNA gene template, whereas the Drosophila IIIB and HeLa IIIC do form stable but nonproductive complexes. These results demonstrate that specific IIIC-IIIB interactions are critical in the formation of productive transcription complexes and are responsible for the observed species specificity of Drosophila and human tRNA gene transcription.",1991,"D L Johnson, M L Treinies, R S Fan"
Accurate and efficient RNA polymerase II transcription with a soluble nuclear fraction derived from Drosophila embryos,1992453,10.1073/pnas.88.3.1024,"We describe the preparation and biochemical properties of a soluble nuclear fraction derived from Drosophila embryos. This extract, which can be easily prepared in 2.5 hr, is capable of accurate and efficient RNA polymerase II transcription of a variety of diverse genes from both Drosophila and mammals. With the relatively strong promoter of the Drosophila Krüppel gene, it is possible to achieve 20% template usage in a single round of transcription, which is considerably higher than the template usage of approximately 3% seen with standard nuclear extracts. Further, although U small nuclear RNA genes are refractory to transcription with HeLa transcription extracts, the soluble nuclear fraction transcribes a U1 small nuclear RNA gene from Drosophila. Moreover, transcriptional activation by sequence-specific activators can be attained in vitro with the soluble nuclear fraction. The overall transcriptional efficiency appears limited to 0.45 transcript per template of DNA per 30 min, but the mechanism of limitation is not known. The soluble nuclear fraction, which was developed to recreate the environment within the nucleus, should be useful when high efficiencies of RNA polymerase II transcription are desired.",1991,"R T Kamakaka, C M Tyree, J T Kadonaga"
Spatially restricted expression of a member of a new family of murine Distal-less homeobox genes in the developing forebrain,1687503,,"The homeobox genes of Drosophila perform key functions in embryonic pattern formation, and their vertebrate counterparts may play similar developmental roles. Using polymerase chain reaction technology, we have identified four murine homologs of the Drosophila Distal-less homeobox gene that are expressed in midgestation embryos. The homeodomains encoded by these genes vary considerably from other known homeodomain sequences and represent a new family of vertebrate homeobox genes. We isolated a cDNA for one of these genes (Dlx-2) and studied its expression by in situ hybridization from 8.5 days postcoitum (pc) until postnatal day 1. Dlx-2 shows a restricted pattern of expression in the ventral forebrain, extending from the olfactory bulb to the ventral diencephalon. This domain of expression may delineate an ontogenetically defined subdivision within the forebrain. The murine Distal-less genes are the first homeobox genes described whose expression in the central nervous system is exclusively restricted to the forebrain. Thus, the Distal-less genes may contribute missing positional cues not provided by the previously identified vertebrate homeobox genes.",1991,"G W Robinson, K A Mahon, S Wray"
Genomic organization of Drosophila choline acetyltransferase,1717651,10.1111/j.1471-4159.1991.tb06362.x,"Choline acetyltransferase (ChAT; acetyl-CoA:choline-O-acetyltransferase; EC 2.3.1.6) is the enzyme responsible for the synthesis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine and is thus the genetic determinant of neurons with a cholinergic phenotype. We have screened a Drosophila genomic library using a cRNA probe, transcribed from Drosophila ChAT cDNA, and isolated three independent clones representing all the exons of this gene. The gene spans more than 26 kb of DNA and is organized into eight exons containing 594, 80, 192, 759, 408, 147, 201, and 1,612 nucleotides. All inserts that hybridized with a cRNA probe have been subcloned and the sequence of intron/exon boundaries determined. The only part of the ChAT gene not represented in our clones is a part of the first intron. A minimum size for this uncloned DNA has been deduced from Southern analysis of Drosophila genomic DNA. We also have probed the transcripts of the ChAT gene by northern analysis of total Drosophila RNA using two different exon-specific antisense RNA probes. An exon I probe detected two bands of RNA whereas an exon VIII probe hybridized with only the smaller band, previously identified as ChAT mRNA.

Toxicology and Carcinogenesis Studies of C.I. Acid Red 114 (CAS No. 6459-94-5) in F344/N Rats (Drinking Water Studies),12621513,,"C.I. Acid Red 114 is one of five chemicals being evaluated in 2-year carcinogenicity and toxicity studies as part of the NTP's Benzidine Dye Initiative. This Initiative was designed to evaluate representative benzidine congeners, benzidine congener-derived dyes, and benzidine-derived dyes. C.I. Acid Red 114 was nominated for study because of the potential for human exposure during production of bisazobiphenyl dyes and because benzidine, a structurally related chemical, is a known human carcinogen. Toxicology and carcinogenesis studies were conducted by administering desalted, industrial grade C.I. Acid Red 114 in drinking water to groups of F344/N rats of each sex for 13 days, 13 weeks, 9 or 15 months, or 2 years. These studies were performed only in rats because studies of benzidine congeners were being performed in mice at the National Center for Toxicological Research (NCTR). Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium, Chinese hamster ovary cells, and Drosophila melanogaster. 13-Day Studies: Rats were exposed to C.I. Acid Red 114 in drinking water at doses of 0, 10,000, 20,000, or 30,000 ppm. All control and dosed rats survived except one male rat in the 20,000 ppm dose group. Final mean body weights in the three dosed groups were 94%, 83%, or 77% of controls for males and 92%, 88%, or 80% of controls for females. Water consumption declined with increased dose. Clinical findings included red stained fur, ears, and tail in all test animals. On gross necropsy, organs and tissues were also stained red. 13-Week Studies: C.I. Acid Red 114 was administered in drinking water at doses of 0, 600, 1,200, 2,500, 5,000, or 10,000 ppm. All control and dosed animals survived until the end of the study. Final mean body weights in the five dosed groups were 97%, 89%, 87%, 87%, or 85% of controls for males and 97%, 94%, 94%, 92%, or 89% of controls for females. Water consumption was decreased in dosed animals. As was seen in the 13-day studies, major organs and tissues from treated animals were stained red. Kidney toxicity characterized by regeneration and karyomegaly of tubule epithelial cells with chronic inflammation was observed in female rats at doses of 1,200 ppm or above. Treatment-related increases in relative liver weights and elevated liver enzyme levels were seen in males and females, centrilobular pallor in the liver was seen in all male dose groups. Because of these body weight differences, decreases in water consumption, and organ toxicity, the doses chosen for the 2-year studies were 70,150, and 300 ppm for males and 150, 300, and 600 for females. 2-Year Studies: Male rats received doses of 0, 70, 150, or 300 ppm of C.I. Acid Red 114, and female rats received 0, 150, 300, or 600 ppm. Seventy animals were in the control and high-dose groups, 45 in the low-dose groups, and 75 in the mid-dose groups. Ten animals were evaluated from the control and high-dose groups at 9 months, and ten animals from all dose groups were evaluated at 15 months. The average amount of compound consumed per day was 4, 8, or 20 mg/kg for males and 9, 20, or 70 mg/kg for females. Survival and Body Weights: Survival at 105 weeks for male rats receiving 0, 70, 150, or 300 ppm was 24/50, 15/35, 26/65, and 1/50; for females receiving 0, 150, or 300 ppm, survival was 36/50, 13/35, and 6/64. All female rats receiving 600 ppm died by week 89. The decreased survival in treated groups was due primarily to the development of chemical-related neoplasms. Of the surviving animals, the final mean body weights for males receiving 70 or 150 ppm were 94% and 90% of control and for females receiving 150 or 300 ppm, 99% and 84% of control. These weight differences began in the second year of the studies and were attributed in part to the development of neoplasms in the dosed groups. Histopathologic Effects in the 2-Year Studies: At 9 and 15 months, a few neoplasms were seen in the liver, lung, clitoral gland, skin, Zymbal's gland, oral cavity epithelium, and small and large intestine, and the number of neoplasms at these sites increased as gland, skin, Zymbal's gland, oral cavity epithelium, and small and large intestine, and the number of neoplasms at these sites increased as the studies progressed. At 2 years, there was a clear carcinogenic response in the skin, Zymbal's gland, and liver of male and female rats, and in the clitoral gland, oral cavity epithelium, small and large intestine, and lung in female rats. Treatment-related increases were also seen in the incidence in neoplasms of the oral cavity epithelium, adrenal gland, and lung of male rats, and in mononuclear cell leukemia and in neoplasms of the mammary gland and adrenal gland in female rats. The incidence of these neoplasms was generally lower, but was significant and considered to be marginally related to chemical treatment. The same neoplastic effects have been previously observed in some or all of the NTP studies with dimethoxybenzidine, dimethylbenzidine, or C.I. Direct Blue 15. Genetic Toxicology: In a standard preincubation protocol, C.I. Acid Red 114 was mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98 in the presence of induced hamster liver S9, and an equivocal response was noted in strain TA100 with hamster liver S9. However, no significant mutagenic activity was noted in strains TA1535 or TA1537 with or without S9 activation. In a modified S. typhimurium gene mutation test which employed reductive metabolism followed by oxidative metabolism with S9 liver enzymes, C.I. Acid Red 114 was strongly mutagenic in strain TA1538. C.I. Acid Red 114 did not induce sister chromatid exchanges or chromosomal aberrations in Chinese hamster ovary cells with or without S9 activation; reductive metabolism was not used in these cytogenetic tests. No increase in sex-linked recessive lethal mutations was observed in germ cells of male Drosophila melanogaster administered C.I. Acid Red 114 by feeding or injection. Conclusions: Under the conditions of these 2-year drinking water studies, there was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of C.I. Acid Red 114 for male F344/N rats, as indicated by benign and malignant neoplasms of the skin, Zymbal's gland, and liver. Increased incidences of neoplasms of the oral cavity epithelium, adrenal gland, and lung may have been related to chemical administration. There was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity for female F344/N rats, as indicated by benign and malignant neoplasms of the skin, Zymbal's gland, clitoral gland, liver, oral cavity epithelium, small and large intestines, and lung. Increased incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia, mammary gland adenocarcinoma, and adrenal gland pheochromocytomas may have been related to chemical administration.

Structure of the Drosophila gene for the laminin B2 chain,1840513,10.1089/dna.1991.10.451,"We isolated and sequenced a Drosophila genomic DNA sequence that encodes the entire coding region of the laminin B2 chain. The 11,464-bp genomic sequence contains a 2.1-kb of 5'-flanking DNA, ten exons, nine introns, and the 3'-flanking region. The first exon encodes a 5' untranslated region; the ATG translational start codon is in exon 2. The entire translated region is within a 8.3-kb Eco RI fragment. The Drosophila laminin B2 gene differs substantially in size and exon pattern from those of the human B1 and B2 genes. However, as in the case of the human B1 gene, the overall exon pattern of the Drosophila B2 gene does not correlate well with the highly conserved structural domains and internal repeats of the B2 polypeptide chain. Unlike the human and mouse B1 and B2 genes, the 2.1-kb 5'-flanking region of the Drosophila B2 gene contains a TATA box and two CAAT boxes. Other potential transcriptional regulatory sequences include two reverse complementary cAMP response element sequences; two sequences that are homologous to the retinoic acid response element motifs of the mouse B1 gene; and sequences homologous to the binding sites for transcription factors dFRA and dJRA, zeste, and possibly GAGA. When transfected into Drosophila SL-2 cells, pCAT plasmid containing 2,090 bp of 5'-flanking region shows a 3.0- to 3.5-fold increase in chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity after induction with retinoic acid and/or 8-bromo-cAMP.

Eight of these new homeobox genes have been chromosomally mapped. Four genes do not belong to any of the known homeobox gene clusters but instead map to new locations on chromosome 1 (single gene) and chromosome 5 (three genes). Sequence comparisons indicate that two of these are very closely related and represent a distinct new category of homeobox genes. The remaining four mapped genes reside in previously established murine homeobox gene clusters. Specifically, two map to the cluster HOX-1 on chromosome 6 and one each to HOX-3 and HOX-4 on chromosome 15 and 2, respectively. The ratio of newly identified homeobox genes to the previously characterized murine homeobox genes suggests that there remain several uncharacterized homeobox genes in the murine genome.",1991,"N A Jenkins, G Singh, D J Gilbert, S Kaur, J L Stock, N G Copeland, S S Potter"

We have isolated cDNA clones which encode an endonuclease, designated HAP1 (human AP endonuclease 1), that catalyses the initial step in AP site repair in human cells. The predicted HAP1 protein has an Mr of 35,500 and shows striking sequence similarity (93% identity) to BAP 1, a bovine AP endonuclease enzyme. Significant sequence homology to two bacterial DNA repair enzymes, E. coli exonuclease III and S. pneumoniae ExoA proteins, and to Drosophila Rrp1 protein is also apparent. We have expressed the HAP1 cDNA in E. coli mutants lacking exonuclease III (xth), endonuclease IV (nfo), or both AP endonucleases. The HAP1 protein can substitute for exonuclease III, but not for endonuclease IV, in respect of some, but not all, DNA repair and mutagenesis functions. Moreover, a dut xth (ts) double mutant, which is nonviable at 42 degrees C due to an accumulation of unrepaired AP sites following excision of uracil from DNA, was rescued by expression of the HAP1 cDNA. These results indicate that AP endonucleases show remarkable conservation of both primary sequence and function. We would predict that the HAP1 protein is important in human cells for protection against the toxic and mutagenic effects of DNA damaging agents.",1991,"I D Hickson, C N Robson"
Geographic distribution and inheritance of three cytoplasmic incompatibility types in Drosophila simulans,1743484,,"Wolbachia-like microorganisms have been implicated in unidirectional cytoplasmic incompatibility between strains of Drosophila simulans. Reduced egg eclosion occurs when females from uninfected strains (type W) are crossed with males from infected strains (type R). Here we characterize a third incompatibility type (type S) which is also correlated with the presence of Wolbachia-like microorganisms. Despite the fact that the symbionts cannot be morphologically distinguished, we observed complete bidirectional incompatibility between R and S strains. This indicates that the determinants of incompatibility are different in the two infected types. S/W incompatibility is unidirectional and similar to R/W incompatibility. A worldwide survey of D. simulans strains showed that type S incompatibility was found only in insular populations which harbor the mitochondrial type SiI. Both W and R types were found among mainland and island populations harboring the worldwide mitochondrial type SiII. Type S incompatibility could be involved in the reinforcement of the geographical isolation of SiI populations.",1991,"J F Ferveur, M Jacques, C Montchamp-Moreau"
Role of the Drosophila patched gene in positional signalling,1653906,10.1038/353184a0,"After cellularization of the Drosophila embryo, positional differences within each primordial segment are maintained and elaborated by processes that require cell interactions. The best-documented examples of such intercellular signalling are the mutual interactions between neighbouring cells expressing the homeodomain protein engrailed and the secreted glycoprotein encoded by wingless, the Drosophila homologue of the murine Wnt-1 gene. Little is known about the molecular basis of these signalling mechanisms but the activities of several other genes, notably patched and hedgehog, have been implicated in the process. Here we show that the role of patched in positional signalling is permissive rather than instructive, its activity being required to suppress wingless transcription in cells predisposed to express the latter. According to this view, expression of wingless is normally maintained only in those cells receiving an extrinsic signal, encoded by hedgehog, that antagonizes the repressive activity of patched. We suggest that the patched protein may itself be the receptor for this signal, implying that this is an unusual mechanism of ligand-dependent receptor inactivation.",1991,"A M Taylor, P W Ingham, Y Nakano"
Transcriptional regulation of a pair-rule stripe in Drosophila,2026328,10.1101/gad.5.5.827,"The periodic, seven-stripe pattern of the primary pair-rule gene even-skipped (eve) is initiated by crude, overlapping gradients of maternal and gap gene proteins in the early Drosophila embryo. Previous genetic studies suggest that one of the stripes, stripe 2, is initiated by the maternal morphogen bicoid (bcd) and the gap protein hunchback (hb), while the borders of the stripe are formed by selective repression, involving the gap protein giant (gt) in anterior regions and the Krüppel (Kr) protein in posterior regions. Here, we present several lines of evidence that are consistent with this model for stripe 2 expression, including in vitro DNA-binding experiments and transient cotransfection assays in cultured cells. These experiments suggest that repression involves a competition or short-range quenching mechanism, whereby the binding of gt and Kr interferes with the binding or activity of bcd and hb activators at overlapping or neighboring sites within the eve stripe 2 promoter element. Such short-range repression could reflect a general property of promoters composed of multiple, but autonomous regulatory elements.",1991,"S Small, M Levine, R Warrior, R Kraut, T Hoey"

Evolution of ribosomal RNA gene copy number on the sex chromosomes of Drosophila melanogaster,1921706,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a040664,"A diverse array of cellular and evolutionary forces--including unequal crossing-over, magnification, compensation, and natural selection--is at play modulating the number of copies of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes on the X and Y chromosomes of Drosophila. Accurate estimates of naturally occurring distributions of copy numbers on both the X and Y chromosomes are needed in order to explore the evolutionary end result of these forces. Estimates of relative copy numbers of the ribosomal DNA repeat, as well as of the type I and type II inserts, were obtained for a series of 96 X chromosomes and 144 Y chromosomes by using densitometric measurements of slot blots of genomic DNA from adult D. melanogaster bearing appropriate deficiencies that reveal chromosome-specific copy numbers. Estimates of copy number were put on an absolute scale with slot blots having serial dilutions both of the repeat and of genomic DNA from nonpolytene larval brain and imaginal discs. The distributions of rRNA copy number are decidedly skewed, with a long tail toward higher copy numbers. These distributions were fitted by a population genetic model that posits three different types of exchange events--sister-chromatid exchange, intrachromatid exchange, and interchromosomal crossing-over. In addition, the model incorporates natural selection, because experimental evidence shows that there is a minimum number of functional elements necessary for survival. Adequate fits of the model were found, indicating that either natural selection also eliminates chromosomes with high copy number or that the rate of intrachromatid exchange exceeds the rate of interchromosomal exchange.",1991,"E M Lyckegaard, A G Clark"
The involvement of alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase in alcohol/aldehyde metabolism in Drosophila melanogaster,1902806,10.1007/BF00058526,"In this study we have examined the roles of alcohol dehydrogenase, aldehyde oxidase, and aldehyde dehydrogenase in the adaptation of Drosophila melanogaster to alcohol environments. Fifteen strains were characterized for genetic variation at the above loci by protein electrophoresis. Levels of in vitro enzyme activity were also determined. The strains examined showed considerable variation in enzyme activity for all three gene-enzyme systems. Each enzyme was also characterized for coenzyme requirements, effect of inhibitors, subcellular location, and tissue specific expression. A subset of the strains was chosen to assess the physiological role of each gene-enzyme system in alcohol and aldehyde metabolism. These strains were characterized for both the ability to utilize alcohols and aldehydes as carbon sources as well as the capacity to detoxify such substrates. The results of the above analyses demonstrate the importance of both alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase in the in vivo metabolism of alcohols and aldehydes.",1991,"S M Anderson, S E Barnett"
The fused protein kinase regulates Hedgehog-stimulated transcriptional activation in Drosophila Schneider 2 cells,11495917,10.1074/jbc.M105871200,"The Drosophila segment polarity gene fused encodes a putative protein-serine/threonine kinase, and plays a critical role in the signal transduction for Hedgehog (Hh)-dependent gene expression. We show that the Drosophila Schneider 2 (S2) cell line has the potential to transduce the Hh-triggered intracellular signals, leading to the activation of target gene expression, when a transcription factor, Cubitus interruptus (Ci), is provided exogenously. Using S2 cells transfected with the Ci-expressing plasmid and a patched promoter reporter construct, we demonstrate that the forced expression of Fused (Fu) stimulates Hh-triggered and Ci-dependent transcriptional activation. The N-terminal kinase domain of Fu is required for this activity, but the C-terminal domain is not. Two kinase-inactive Fu mutants fail to enhance the reporter activation, indicating that the kinase catalytic activity is essential for this function. Negative components of the Hh-signaling pathway, Costal-2 and Suppressor of Fused, strongly antagonize the Fu activity, irrespective of the presence or absence of the Fu C-terminal domain, suggesting an indirect mechanism for the inhibition of Fu by these proteins. Furthermore, mutational analyses of threonine 158 and serine 159, in the activation segment of the Fu protein kinase, indicate that threonine 158 is essential for Fu activity and that phosphorylation of this threonine residue may be involved in the activation of the kinase catalytic activity upon Hh stimulation.",2001,"R Watanabe-Fukunaga, S Nagata, R Fukunaga, K Fujisawa, T Fukumoto"
Enteric bacteria counteract lipopolysaccharide induction of antimicrobial peptide genes,11739510,10.4049/jimmunol.167.12.6920,"The humoral immunity of Drosophila involves the production of antimicrobial peptides, which are induced by evolutionary conserved microbial molecules, like LPS. By using Drosophila mbn-2 cells, we found that live bacteria, including E. coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Erwinia carotovora, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, prevented LPS from inducing antimicrobial peptide genes, while Micrococcus luteus and Streptococcus equi did not. The inhibitory effect was seen at bacterial levels from 20 per mbn-2 cell, while antimicrobial peptides were induced at lower bacterial concentrations (< or =2 bacteria per cell) also in the absence of added LPS. Gel shift experiment suggests that the inhibitory effect is upstream or at the level of the activation of the transcription factor Relish, a member of the NF-kappaB/Rel family. The bacteria have to be in physical contact with the cells, but not phagocytosed, to prevent LPS induction. Interestingly, the inhibiting mechanism is, at least for E. coli, independent of the type III secretion system, indicating that the inhibitory mechanism is unrelated to the one earlier described for YopJ from Yersinia.",2001,"Y Engström, K C Johansson, K Söderhäll, S Stöven, D Hultmark, H Lindmark"
"The Friend of GATA proteins U-shaped, FOG-1, and FOG-2 function as negative regulators of blood, heart, and eye development in Drosophila",11404479,10.1073/pnas.131215798,"Friend of GATA (FOG) proteins regulate GATA factor-activated gene transcription. During vertebrate hematopoiesis, FOG and GATA proteins cooperate to promote erythrocyte and megakaryocyte differentiation. The Drosophila FOG homologue U-shaped (Ush) is expressed similarly in the blood cell anlage during embryogenesis. During hematopoiesis, the acute myeloid leukemia 1 homologue Lozenge and Glial cells missing are required for the production of crystal cells and plasmatocytes, respectively. However, additional factors have been predicted to control crystal cell proliferation. In this report, we show that Ush is expressed in hemocyte precursors and plasmatocytes throughout embryogenesis and larval development, and the GATA factor Serpent is essential for Ush embryonic expression. Furthermore, loss of ush function results in an overproduction of crystal cells, whereas forced expression of Ush reduces this cell population. Murine FOG-1 and FOG-2 also can repress crystal cell production, but a mutant version of FOG-2 lacking a conserved motif that binds the corepressor C-terminal binding protein fails to affect the cell lineage. The GATA factor Pannier (Pnr) is required for eye and heart development in Drosophila. When Ush, FOG-1, FOG-2, or mutant FOG-2 is coexpressed with Pnr during these developmental processes, severe eye and heart phenotypes result, consistent with a conserved negative regulation of Pnr function. These results indicate that the fly and mouse FOG proteins function similarly in three distinct cellular contexts in Drosophila, but may use different mechanisms to regulate genetic events in blood vs. cardial or eye cell lineages.",2001,"S H Orkin, Q Zhang, S G Tevosian, K Gajewski, N Fossett, R A Schulz"

In Drosophila melanogaster, Tehao shares a striking similarity in its intracellular domain with Toll. In this paper, we show that Tehao is expressed throughout development and appears to be glycosylated. In transiently transfected cells, Tehao activated both Dorsal and the transcription of endogenous drosomycin and metchnikowin genes. Purified recombinant Tehao interacted specifically in vitro not only with the Pelle protein kinase, but also with the Toll intracytoplasmic domain. Remarkably, Tehao was found to activate Dorsal-dependent transcription in a synergistic manner with Toll, as well as Pelle in co-transfected cells. Thus, Tehao, alone or with Toll as a multimeric complex, has the potential to participate in both the development and innate immune responses of Drosophila.",2001,"L Zheng, B Shen, J L Manley, C Luo"
"Technical knockout, a Drosophila model of mitochondrial deafness",11560901,,"Mutations in mtDNA-encoded components of the mitochondrial translational apparatus are associated with diverse pathological states in humans, notably sensorineural deafness. To develop animal models of such disorders, we have manipulated the nuclear gene for mitochondrial ribosomal protein S12 in Drosophila (technical knockout, tko). The prototypic mutant tko(25t) exhibits developmental delay, bang sensitivity, impaired male courtship, and defective response to sound. On the basis of a transgenic reversion test, these phenotypes are attributable to a single substitution (L85H) at a conserved residue of the tko protein. The mutant is hypersensitive to doxycyclin, an antibiotic that selectively inhibits mitochondrial protein synthesis, and mutant larvae have greatly diminished activities of mitochondrial redox enzymes and decreased levels of mitochondrial small-subunit rRNA. A second mutation in the tko gene, Q116K, which is predicted to impair the accuracy of mitochondrial translation, results in the completely different phenotype of recessive female sterility, based on three independent transgenic insertions. We infer that the tko(25t) mutant provides a model of mitochondrial hearing impairment resulting from a quantitative deficiency of mitochondrial translational capacity.",2001,"J M Toivonen, S Touraille, K Luoto, M Lehtonen, Z Wang, S C Irvine, N Petit, M Longmuir, K M O'Dell, G K Knight, Z H Shah, S Alziari, H T Jacobs"
Purine-rich exon sequences are not necessarily splicing enhancer sequence in the dystrophin gene,11781497,,"Purine-rich sequences within exons are proposed to promote proper splicing as splicing enhancers. In order to test this supposition in the dystrophin gene, which is characterized by the large size of its introns, purine-rich sequences from three exons (exons 43, 46 and 53) were examined for their splicing enhancer activity by using a Drosophila doublesex pre-mRNA. The most powerful activating effect on upstream intron splicing was seen with a sequence from exon 43. A sequence from exon 53 showed relatively low activity, whilst that from exon 46 had little effect. To characterize the splicing enhancer sequences in exons 53 and 46 further, entire exons were divided into 30nt fragments that were examined separately for their splicing enhancer activity. In exon 53, two fragments located at the 5' and 3' ends, respectively, had strong splicing enhancer activity, although they were not the most purine-rich regions of the exon. In contrast, all of the fragments derived from exon 46 had little activity. These results suggest that different exons in the dystrophin transcript are subject to different mechanisms of control by the splicing machinery.",2001,"H Nakamura, T Ito, M Matsuo, H Sakamoto, Y Takeshima"
Progress curves analysis as an alternative for exploration of activation-inhibition phenomena in cholinesterases,11916145,10.1080/14756360109162388,"The kinetic behaviour of insect acetylcholinesterases deviates from the Michaelis-Menten pattern. These deviations are known as activation or inhibition at various substrate concentrations and can be more or less observable depending on mutations around the active site of the enzyme. Most kinetic studies on these enzymes still rely on initial rate measurements. It is demonstrated here that according to this method one of the deviations can be overlooked. We attempt to point out that in such cases a detailed step-by-step progress curves analysis is successful. The study is focused on two different methods of analysing progress curves: (i) the first one is based on an integrated initial rate equation which can sufficiently fit truncated progress curves under corresponding conditions; and (ii) the other one precludes the algebraic formulae, but uses numerical integration for searching a non analytical solution of ordinary differential equations describing a kinetic model. All methods are tested on three different acetylcholinesterase mutants from Drosophila melanogaster. The results indicate that kinetic parameters for the E107K mutant with highly expressive activation and inhibition can be well evaluated applying any analysis method. It is quite different for E107W and E107Y mutants where latent activation is present, but discovered only using one or the other progress curves analysis methods.",2001,M Golicnik
"Effect of triplet repeat expansion on chromatin structure and expression of DMPK and neighboring genes, SIX5 and DMWD, in myotonic dystrophy",11592825,10.1006/mgme.2001.3229,"Myotonic dystrophy (DM), an autosomal dominant neuromuscular disease, is associated with expansion of a polymorphic (CTG)n repeat in the 3'-untranslated region of the DM protein kinase (DMPK) gene. The repeat expansion results in decreased levels of DMPK mRNA and protein, but the mechanism for this decreased expression is unknown. Loss of a nuclease-hypersensitive site in the region of the repeat expansion has been observed in muscle and skin fibroblasts from DM patients, indicating a change in local chromatin structure. This change in chromatin structure has been proposed as a mechanism whereby the expression of DMPK and neighboring genes, sine oculis homeobox (Drosophila) homolog 5 (SIX5) and dystrophia myotonica-containing WD repeat motif (DMWD), might be affected. We have developed a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based method to assay the chromatin sensitivity of the region adjacent to the repeat expansion in somatic cell hybrids carrying either normal or affected DMPK alleles and show that hybrids carrying expanded alleles exhibit decreased sensitivity to PvuII digestion in this region. Semiquantitative multiplex reverse transcriptase PCR (RT/PCR) assays of gene expression from the chromosomes carrying the expanded alleles showed marked reduction of DMPK mRNA, partial inhibition of SIX5 expression from a congenital DM chromosome, and no reduction of DMWD mRNA. Nested RT/PCR analysis of DMPK mRNA from somatic cell hybrids carrying the repeat expansions revealed that most of the DMPK transcripts expressed from the expanded alleles lacked exons 13 and 14, whereas full-length transcripts were expressed predominantly from the normal alleles. These results suggest that the CTG repeat expansion leads to a decrease in DMPK mRNA levels by affecting splicing at the 3' end of the DMPK pre-mRNA transcript.",2001,"K R Singleton, P Carango, P A Moses, V L Funanage, R Frisch, I L Gonzalez, H G Marks"
The nuclear location and chromatin organization of active chorion amplification origins,11513291,10.1007/s004120100131,"It remains unclear how certain regions on metazoan chromosomes are selected to initiate DNA replication. In recent years a number of origins of DNA replication have been mapped, but there is still no DNA consensus for predicting where replication will initiate. Evidence suggests that the higher order structure of the nucleus and chromosome influences origin activity. Chromosomal DNA replication is proposed to occur in special compartments in the nucleus called replication foci. Foci in different regions of the nucleus initiate replication at different times of S-phase, suggesting nuclear position may contribute to where and when replication begins. Here we test the contribution of nuclear compartments for well-defined origins, those involved in amplification of the chorion (eggshell) genes during Drosophila oogenesis. The results of three-dimensional confocal microscopy indicate that chorion DNA replication origins are highly active in diverse positions within the nucleus. We also find that chorion replication origins inserted at ectopic chromosomal sites can amplify highly in diverse nuclear locations distinct from the endogenous loci, including when they are buffered against genomic position effects. We used fluorescence in situ hybridization to analyze chromosome structure during amplification. Contrary to the replication factory model, we find no evidence for spooling of DNA toward a replication center. We discuss the implications of these results for understanding the role of higher order structure in amplification and chromosome duplication.",2001,"A C Spradling, B R Calvi"

The polypeptide is composed of domains or repeats characteristic of the TSP3/TSP4/COMP subfamily of thrombospondin proteins: Amino-terminal domain, four Type II repeats, seven Type III repeats, carboxyl-terminal domain. The protein is highly acidic, particularly in the region of Type III repeats, with an Asp + Glu content of 15.8%. A signal peptide was detected at the N-terminus, which indicates that DTSP, like other TSPs, functions as an extracellular protein. Ten Asn residues were identified as potential glycosylation sites.

Comparative insect developmental genetics: phenotypes without mutants,11340618,10.1002/bies.1055,"The last decade has seen a dramatic increase in interest in the extent to which morphological evolution depends on changes in regulatory pathways.

In a recent paper, Hughes and Kaufman have used a new methodology, RNA interference, in the milkweed bug, Oncopeltus fasciatus, to phenocopy the effects of mutations in Hox genes. RNA interference involves the injection of double-stranded RNA of the same sequence as the relevant mRNA resulting in a depletion of that transcript.

corto genetically interacts with Pc-G and trx-G genes and maintains the anterior boundary of Ultrabithorax expression in Drosophila larvae,11810228,10.1007/s004380100572,"In Drosophila melanogaster, segment identity is determined by specific expression of homeotic genes (Hox). The Hox expression pattern is first initiated by gap and pair-rule genes and then maintained by genes of the Polycomb-group (Pc-G) and the trithorax-group (trx-G). The corto gene is a putative regulator of the Hox genes since mutants exhibit homeotic transformations. We show here that, in addition to previously reported genetic interactions with the Pc-G genes Enhancer of zeste, Polycomb and polyhomeotic, mutations in corto enhance the extra-sex-comb phenotype of multi sex combs, Polycomb-like and Sex combs on midleg. corto also genetically interacts with a number of trx-G genes (ash1, kismet, kohtalo, moira, osa, Trithorax-like and Vha55). The interactions with genes of the trx-G lead to phenotypes displayed in the wing, in the postpronotum or in the thoracic mechanosensory bristles. In addition, we analyzed the regulation of the Hox gene Ultrabithorax (Ubx) in corto mutants. Our results provide evidence that corto maintains the anterior border of Ubx expression in third-instar larvae.

Results: We have isolated a Drosophila homologue of AGO1, dAGO1, in our attempt to search genetically for regulators of Wingless (Wg) signal transduction. dAGO1 is broadly expressed in the embryo and the imaginal disc. dAGO1 over-expression at wing margins suggested that it behaves as a positive regulator in the genetic background employed. Loss-of-function mutations of dAGO1, unexpectedly, did not give typical segment polarity phenotypes of the wg class; instead, dAGO1 maternal and zygotic mutant embryos showed developmental defects, with malformation of the nervous system being the most prominent. The mutant decreased in the numbers of several types of neurones and glia examined. The dAGO1 protein was distributed in the cytoplasm and co-sedimented with poly(U)- or poly(A)-conjugated beads.

Intraspecific competition favours niche width expansion in Drosophila melanogaster,11260712,10.1038/35068555,"Ecologists have proposed that when interspecific competition is reduced, competition within a species becomes a potent evolutionary force leading to rapid diversification. This view reflects the observation that populations invading species-poor communities frequently evolve broader niches. Niche expansion can be associated with an increase in phenotypic variance (known as character release), with the evolution of polymorphisms, or with divergence into many species using distinct resources (adaptive radiation). The relationship between intraspecific competition and diversification is known from theory, and has been used as the foundation for some models of speciation. However, there has been little empirical proof that niches evolve in response to intraspecific competition. To test this hypothesis, I introduced cadmium-intolerant Drosophila melanogaster populations to environments containing both cadmium-free and cadmium-laced resources. Here I show that populations experiencing high competition adapted to cadmium more rapidly than low competition populations. This provides experimental confirmation that competition in a population can drive niche expansion onto new resources for which competition is less severe.",2001,D I Bolnick

We have investigated fore- and hindgut development and we present evidence that the Drosophila knirps and knirps-related genes are key components to spatially restrict endoreduplication domains. Our lack and gain-of-function experiments show that knirps and knirps-related which encode nuclear orphan receptors transcriptionally repress S-phase genes of the cell cycle required for DNA replication and that this down-regulation is crucial for gut morphogenesis. Furthermore, we demonstrate that both genes are activated in overlapping expression domains in the fore- and hindgut in response to Wingless and Hedgehog activities emanating from epithelial signaling centers that control the regionalization of the gut tube.

Adaptable doxycycline-regulated gene expression systems for Drosophila,11404007,10.1016/s0378-1119(01)00447-4,"We have engineered two new versions of the doxycycline (dox) inducible system for use in Drosophila. In the first system, we have used the ubiquitously expressed Drosophila actin5C promoter to express the Tet-Off transactivator (tTA) in all tissue. Induction of a luciferase target transgene begins 6 h after placing the flies on dox-free food. Feeding drug-free food to mothers results in universal target gene expression in their embryos. Larvae raised on regular food also show robust expression of a target reporter gene. In the second version, we have used the Gal4-UAS system to spatially limit expression of the transactivator. Dox withdrawal results in temporally- and spatially-restricted, inducible expression of luciferase in the adult head and embryo. Both the actin5C and Gal4-UAS versions produce more than 100-fold induction of luciferase in the adult, with virtually no leaky expression in the presence of drug. Reporter gene expression is also undetectable in larvae or embryos from mothers fed dox-containing food. Such tight control may be due to the incorporation of Drosophila insulator elements (SCS and SCS') into the transgenic vectors.

We exploited this finding to examine the roles of autophagy in cell growth and death, and to test the interaction of Atg1 with the TOR signaling pathway. These studies provided genetic evidence that autophagy is a potent inhibitor of cell growth, and that high levels of autophagy lead to caspase-dependent apoptotic cell death in vivo.

Identification and characterization of a juvenile hormone response element and its binding proteins,17956872,10.1074/jbc.M704595200,"Juvenile hormones (JH) regulate a wide variety of developmental and physiological processes in insects. Comparison of microarray data on JH-induced genes in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, L57 cells and in the honey bee, Apis mellifera, identified 16 genes that are induced in both species. Analysis of promoter regions of these 16 D. melanogaster genes identified DmJHRE1 (D. melanogaster JH response element 1). In L57 cells, the reporter gene regulated by DmJHRE1 was induced by JH III. Two proteins (FKBP39 and Chd64) that bind to DmJHRE1 were identified. FKBP39 and Chd64 double-stranded RNA inhibited JH III induction of a reporter gene regulated by DmJHRE1. FKBP39 and Chd64 proteins expressed in yeast bound to DmJHRE1. Two-hybrid and pull-down assays showed that these two proteins interact with each other as well as with ecdysone receptor, ultraspiracle, and methoprene-tolerant protein. Developmental expression profiles and JH induction of mRNA for FKBP39 and Chd64 proteins and their interaction with proteins known to be involved in both JH (methoprene-tolerant protein) and ecdysteroid action (ecdysone receptor and ultraspiracle) suggest that these proteins probably play important roles in cross-talk between JH and ecdysteroids.",2007,"Zhaolin Zhang, Gene E Robinson, Yiping Li, Subba R Palli"

We identified two highly conserved GATA factor genes in a marine annelid, the polychaete Platynereis dumerilii. A phylogenetic analysis indicates that the two Platynereis GATA factors are orthologous to the GATA1/2/3 and GATA4/5/6 subfamilies present in vertebrates. We also identified conserved motifs within each GATA class, and assigned the divergent Caenorhabditiselegans and Drosophila melanogaster GATA factor genes to the vertebrate classes. Similar to their vertebrate homologs, PdGATA123 mRNA expression was restricted to ectoderm, whereas PdGATA456 was detected only in endomesoderm. Finally, we identified in genome databases one GATA factor gene in each of two distantly related cnidarians that include motifs from both bilaterian GATA factor classes. Our results show that distinct orthologs of the two vertebrate GATA factor classes exist in a protostome invertebrate, suggesting that bilaterian GATA factors originated from GATA1/2/3 and 4/5/6 ancestral orthologs.

The doublesex splicing enhancer components Tra2 and Rbp1 also repress splicing through an intronic silencer,17101798,10.1128/MCB.01572-06,"The activation of sex-specific alternative splice sites in the Drosophila melanogaster doublesex and fruitless pre-mRNAs has been well studied and depends on the serine-arginine-rich (SR) splicing factors Tra, Tra2, and Rbp1. Little is known, however, about how SR factors negatively regulate splice sites in other RNAs. Here we examine how Tra2 blocks splicing of the M1 intron from its own transcript. We identify an intronic splicing silencer (ISS) adjacent to the M1 branch point that is sufficient to confer Tra2-dependent repression on another RNA. The ISS was found to function independently of its position within the intron, arguing against the idea that bound repressors function by simply interfering with branch point accessibility to general splicing factors. Conserved subelements of the silencer include five short repeated sequences that are required for Tra2 binding but differ from repeated binding sites found in Tra2-dependent splicing enhancers. The ISS also contains a consensus binding site for Rbp1, and this protein was found to facilitate repression of M1 splicing both in vitro and in Drosophila larvae. In contrast to the cooperative binding of SR proteins observed on the doublesex splicing enhancer, we found that Rbp1 and Tra2 bind to the ISS independently through distinct sequences. Our results suggest that functionally synergistic interactions of these SR factors can cause either splicing activation or repression.",2007,"Shihuang Su, William Mattox, Junlin Qi"
Genetic screen for regulators of ind expression identifies shrew as encoding a novel twisted gastrulation-like protein involved in Dpp signaling,17969149,10.1002/dvdy.21360,"Initiation and refinement of expression of the Ind homeodomain protein in the Drosophila embryo is coordinately regulated by global dorsoventral patterning pathways Dorsal, Egfr, and Dpp, and well as by Vnd, which positions the ventral boundary of Ind. Therefore, we set out to look for novel regulators of dorsoventral patterning by screening the Exelixis deficiency collection for modified expression of Ind. Indeed, we found deficiencies that remove components of the known signaling pathways had altered or lost ind expression. These findings included deficiencies that remove screw, dpp, and egfr as well as deficiencies that remove ind itself. In addition, we found several deficiencies that had altered or loss of ind expression. We also observed phenotypes suggestive of dorsoventral patterning defects such as twisting during gastrulation, and defects associated with loss of dorsal specification. These include a pair of overlapping deficiencies that produced ventralized embryos. We find that transheterozygotes of these two deficiencies are also ventralized. There are seven genes common to both deficiencies, including CG11582, which encodes a twisted gastrulation-like protein. These two deficiencies are also allelic with shrew mutations. Here, we present data supporting the conclusion that CG11582 is the gene affected in shrew mutants.",2007,"Jennifer Sands, Tonia Von Ohlen, Canda Harvey, Will Poulson, Morgan Bonds"
Contribution of hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions to the membrane integration of the Shaker K+ channel voltage sensor domain,17488813,10.1073/pnas.0611007104,"Membrane-embedded voltage-sensor domains in voltage-dependent potassium channels (K(v) channels) contain an impressive number of charged residues. How can such highly charged protein domains be efficiently inserted into biological membranes? In the plant K(v) channel KAT1, the S2, S3, and S4 transmembrane helices insert cooperatively, because the S3, S4, and S3-S4 segments do not have any membrane insertion ability by themselves. Here we show that, in the Drosophila Shaker K(v) channel, which has a more hydrophobic S3 helix than KAT1, S3 can both insert into the membrane by itself and mediate the insertion of the S3-S4 segment in the absence of S2. An engineered KAT1 S3-S4 segment in which the hydrophobicity of S3 was increased or where S3 was replaced by Shaker S3 behaves as Shaker S3-S4. Electrostatic interactions among charged residues in S2, S3, and S4, including the salt bridges between E283 or E293 in S2 and R368 in S4, are required for fully efficient membrane insertion of the Shaker voltage-sensor domain. These results suggest that cooperative insertion of the voltage-sensor transmembrane helices is a property common to K(v) channels and that the degree of cooperativity depends on a balance between electrostatic and hydrophobic forces.",2007,"Nobuyuki Uozumi, Liyan Zhang, Gunnar von Heijne, Jong-Kook Lee, Tara Hessa, Yoko Sato, Masao Sakaguchi, Itsuo Kodama"
"Mutation of Drosophila Lsd1 disrupts H3-K4 methylation, resulting in tissue-specific defects during development",17462898,10.1016/j.cub.2007.03.068,"Histone-tail modifications play a fundamental role in the processes that establish chromatin structure and determine gene expression. One such modification, histone methylation, was considered irreversible until the recent discovery of histone demethylases. Lsd1 was the first histone demethylase to be identified. Lsd1 is highly conserved in many species, from yeast to humans, but its function has primarily been studied through biochemical approaches. The mammalian ortholog has been shown to demethylate monomethyl- and dimethyl-K4 and -K9 residues of histone H3. Here we describe the effects of Lsd1 mutation in Drosophila. The inactivation of dLsd1 strongly affects the global level of monomethyl- and dimethyl-H3-K4 methylation and results in elevated expression of a subset of genes. dLsd1 is not an essential gene, but animal viability is strongly reduced in mutant animals in a gender-specific manner. Interestingly, dLsd1 mutants are sterile and possess defects in ovary development, indicating that dLsd1 has tissue-specific functions. Mutant alleles of dLsd1 suppress positional-effect variegation, suggesting a disruption of the balance between euchromatin and heterochromatin. Taken together, these results show that dLsd1-mediated H3-K4 demethylation has a significant and specific role in Drosophila development.",2007,"Jun-Yuan Ji, Nicholas Dyson, Luisa Di Stefano, Anabel Herr, Nam-Sung Moon"
"Functional roles for beta1,4-N-acetlygalactosaminyltransferase-A in Drosophila larval neurons and muscles",17151241,10.1534/genetics.106.065565,"Adult Drosophila mutant for the glycosyltransferase beta1,4-N-acetlygalactosaminyltransferase-A (beta4GalNAcTA) display an abnormal locomotion phenotype, indicating a role for this enzyme, and the glycan structures that it generates, in the neuromuscular system. To investigate the functional role of this enzyme in more detail, we turned to the accessible larval neuromuscular system and report here that larvae mutant for beta4GalNAcTA display distinct nerve and muscle phenotypes. Mutant larvae exhibit abnormal backward crawling, reductions in nerve terminal bouton number, decreased spontaneous transmitter-release frequency, and short, wide muscles. This muscle shape change appears to result from hypercontraction since the individual sarcomeres are shorter in mutant muscles. Analysis of muscle calcium signals showed altered calcium handling in the mutant, suggesting a mechanism by which hypercontraction could occur. All of these phenotypes can be rescued by a transgene carrying the beta4GalNAcTA genomic region. Tissue-specific expression, using the Gal4-UAS system, reveals that neural expression rescues the mutant crawling phenotype, while muscle expression rescues the muscle defect. Tissue-specific expression did not appear to rescue the decrease in neuromuscular junction bouton number, suggesting that this defect arises from cooperation between nerve and muscle. Altogether, these results suggest that beta4GalNAcTA has at least three distinct functional roles.",2007,"Bryan A Stewart, Nicola Haines"
Intersectin enhances huntingtin aggregation and neurodegeneration through activation of c-Jun-NH2-terminal kinase,17550941,10.1093/hmg/ddm134,"Huntingon's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease arising from expansion of a polyglutamine (polyQ) tract in the protein huntingtin (Htt) resulting in aggregation of mutant Htt into nuclear and/or cytosolic inclusions in neurons. Mutant Htt affects multiple processes including protein degradation, transcription, signal transduction, fast axonal transport and endocytosis [reviewed in Ross, C.A. and Poirier, M.A. (2005) Opinion: what is the role of protein aggregation in neurodegeneration? Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol., 6, 891-898]. Here, we report that the endocytic and signal transduction scaffold intersectin (ITSN) increased aggregate formation by mutant Htt through activation of the c-Jun-NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK)-MAPK pathway. Conversely, silencing ITSN or inhibiting JNK attenuated aggregate formation. Using a Drosophila model for polyQ repeat disease, we observed that ITSN enhanced polyQ-mediated neurotoxicity. A reciprocal relationship was observed between ITSN and Htt. While ITSN enhanced Htt aggregation and toxicity, Htt, in turn, inhibited the cooperativity between ITSN and the epidermal growth factor receptor signal transduction pathway. Finally, we observed that ITSN overexpression enhanced aggregation of polyQ-expanded androgen receptor (AR) as well as wild-type versions of both Htt and AR suggesting a broader involvement of ITSN in neurodegenerative diseases through destabilization of polyQ-containing proteins.",2007,"Negin P Martin, John P O'Bryan, Tong-Wey Koh, Erica Scappini"
Unfolded protein response in Drosophila: why another model can make it fly,17387279,10.4161/cc.6.7.4064,"The unfolded protein response (UPR) is an intracellular signaling pathway that is activated in response to stress in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).

While significant progress has been made in various experimental systems over the years, suitable models for in vivo analyses of UPR and disease remain scarce. In this regard, recent developments of Drosophila markers and genetic tools for UPR studies provide powerful means to investigate the connection between UPR and disease in vivo.

Research on the karyotype and evolution of Drosophila melanogaster species group,17498617,10.1016/S1673-8527(07)60021-6,"Mitotic metaphase chromosomes of 34 species of Drosophila melanogaster species group were examined. Certain new karyotypes were described for the first time, and their evolutionary and interspecific genetic relationships among 8 subgroups of D. melanogaster species group were analyzed systematically. The results were as follows. The basic karyotype of elegans subgroup was type A. The karyotypes of eugracilis subgroup, melanogaster subgroup, and ficusphila subgroup were all type C. The karyotypes of takahashii subgroup and suzukii subgroup were both type C and type D. The montium subgroup had six kinds of karyotypes: types B, C, C', D, D', and E. The ananassae subgroup had three kinds of karyotypes: types F, G, and H.

The above-mentioned results in karyotypic evolution were consistent with those of DNA sequence analysis reported by Yang except for the elegans subgroup and this subgroup was considered as the ancestral subgroup.

Mate preference arenas eliminated intrasexual combat and intersexual coercion. The time female and male choosers spent in arena tests near either of two opposite-sex individuals measured the preferences of choosers. We placed choosers in breeding trials with their preferred or nonpreferred discriminatee when they met the minimum criteria for showing the same preference in two consecutive tests. There was no statistically significant difference in the frequency of female and male choosers meeting minimal preference criteria. There was a significant difference between female and male choosers for offspring viability, with female choice having the greater effect, but there was not a significant difference in the overall reproductive success of male and female choosers. There were significant differences in fitness between matings to preferred and nonpreferred partners. Female and male choosers paired with their nonpreferred discriminatees had offspring of significantly lower viability, as predicted by the constraints hypothesis.

Drosophila Ctr1A functions as a copper transporter essential for development,17573340,10.1074/jbc.M703792200,"Copper is an essential trace element required by all aerobic organisms as a cofactor for enzymes involved in normal growth, development, and physiology. Ctr1 proteins are members of a highly conserved family of copper importers responsible for copper uptake across the plasma membrane. Mice lacking Ctr1 die during embryogenesis from widespread developmental defects, demonstrating the need for adequate copper acquisition in the development of metazoan organisms via as yet uncharacterized mechanisms. Whereas the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, expresses three Ctr1 genes, ctr1A, ctr1B, and ctr1C, little is known about their protein isoform-specific roles. Previous studies demonstrated that Ctr1B localizes to the plasma membrane and is not essential for development unless flies are severely copper-deficient or are subjected to copper toxicity. Here we demonstrate that Ctr1A also resides on the plasma membrane and is the primary Drosophila copper transporter. Loss of Ctr1A results in copper-remedial developmental arrest at early larval stages. Ctr1A mutants are deficient in the activity of copper-dependent enzymes, including cytochrome c oxidase and tyrosinase. Amidation of Phe-Met-Arg-Phe-amides, a group of cardiomodulatory neuropeptide hormones that are matured via the action of peptidylglycine alpha-hydroxylating monooxygenase, is defective in neuroendocrine cells of Ctr1A mutant larvae. Moreover, both the Phe-Met-Arg-Phe-amide maturation and heart beat rate defects observed in Ctr1A mutant larvae can be partially rescued by exogenous copper. These studies establish clear physiological distinctions between two Drosophila plasma membrane copper transport proteins and demonstrate that copper import by Ctr1A is required to drive neuropeptide maturation during normal growth and development.",2007,"Michelle L Turski, Dennis J Thiele"
CRAC channel activity in C. elegans is mediated by Orai1 and STIM1 homologues and is essential for ovulation and fertility,17218360,10.1113/jphysiol.2006.124883,"The Ca(2+) release-activated Ca(2+) (CRAC) channel is a plasma membrane Ca(2+) entry pathway activated by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca(2+) store depletion. STIM1 proteins function as ER Ca(2+) sensors and regulate CRAC channel activation. Recent studies have demonstrated that CRAC channels are encoded by the human Orai1 gene and a homologous Drosophila gene. C. elegans intestinal cells express a store-operated Ca(2+) channel (SOCC) regulated by STIM-1. We cloned a full-length C. elegans cDNA that encodes a 293 amino acid protein, ORAI-1, homologous to human and Drosophila Orai1 proteins. ORAI-1 GFP reporters are co-expressed with STIM-1 in the gonad and intestine. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP(3))-dependent Ca(2+) signalling regulates C. elegans gonad function, fertility and rhythmic posterior body wall muscle contraction (pBoc) required for defecation. RNA interference (RNAi) silencing of orai-1 expression phenocopies stim-1 knockdown and causes sterility and prevents intestinal cell SOCC activation, but has no effect on pBoc or intestinal Ca(2+) signalling. Orai-1 RNAi suppresses pBoc defects induced by intestinal expression of a STIM-1 Ca(2+)-binding mutant, indicating that the proteins function in a common pathway. Co-expression of stim-1 and orai-1 cDNAs in HEK293 cells induces large inwardly rectifying cation currents activated by ER Ca(2+) depletion. The properties of this current recapitulate those of the native SOCC current. We conclude that C. elegans expresses bona fide CRAC channels that require the function of Orai1- and STIM1-related proteins. CRAC channels thus arose very early in animal evolution. In C. elegans, CRAC channels do not play obligate roles in all IP(3)-dependent signalling processes and ER Ca(2+) homeostasis. Instead, we suggest that CRAC channels carry out highly specialized and cell-specific signalling roles and that they may function as a failsafe mechanism to prevent Ca(2+) store depletion under pathophysiological and stress conditions.",2007,"Juan Xing, Kevin Strange, Xiaohui Yan, Catherine Lorin-Nebel"
Fine-tuning enhancer models to predict transcriptional targets across multiple genomes,17973026,10.1371/journal.pone.0001115,"Networks of regulatory relations between transcription factors (TF) and their target genes (TG)- implemented through TF binding sites (TFBS)- are key features of biology. An idealized approach to solving such networks consists of starting from a consensus TFBS or a position weight matrix (PWM) to generate a high accuracy list of candidate TGs for biological validation. Developing and evaluating such approaches remains a formidable challenge in regulatory bioinformatics. We perform a benchmark study on 34 Drosophila TFs to assess existing TFBS and cis-regulatory module (CRM) detection methods, with a strong focus on the use of multiple genomes. Particularly, for CRM-modelling we investigate the addition of orthologous sites to a known PWM to construct phyloPWMs and we assess the added value of phylogenentic footprinting to predict contextual motifs around known TFBSs. For CRM-prediction, we compare motif conservation with network-level conservation approaches across multiple genomes. Choosing the optimal training and scoring strategies strongly enhances the performance of TG prediction for more than half of the tested TFs. Finally, we analyse a 35(th) TF, namely Eyeless, and find a significant overlap between predicted TGs and candidate TGs identified by microarray expression studies. In summary we identify several ways to optimize TF-specific TG predictions, some of which can be applied to all TFs, and others that can be applied only to particular TFs. The ability to model known TF-TG relations, together with the use of multiple genomes, results in a significant step forward in solving the architecture of gene regulatory networks.",2007,"Olivier Sand, Bassem A Hassan, Stein Aerts, Jacques van Helden"

Topical application of histamine inhibited spontaneous neuronal firing in the X-organ sinus gland tract, concomitant with an increase in the membrane conductance. In X-organ neurons in culture and under voltage-clamp conditions, histamine evoked outward currents at -40 mV that reversed at the Cl(-) equilibrium potential. Histamine sensitivity in these neurons had a half-maximal response (EC(50))=3.3+/-1 micromol l(-1), with a Hill number of 2.6+/-0.4. The histamine-evoked current was blocked by tiotidine, cimetidine, ranitidine and 256+/-11 and 483+/-11 micromol l(-1), respectively) and d-tubocurarine (IC(50)=21+/-2 micromol l(-1)), but was insensitive to picrotoxin, bicuculline and strychnine. Neither GABA nor glutamate was capable of desensitizing the histamine response, indicating that histamine activates a particular Cl(-) conductance. The presence of immunoreactive neurons to histamine in the medulla terminalis with axonal projections to the neuropile suggests a possible histaminergic modulation of the X-organ sinus gland system.",2007,"Ubaldo García, Jorge Cebada"

Antagonistic selection between adult thorax and wing size in field released Drosophila melanogaster independent of thermal conditions,17887974,10.1111/j.1420-9101.2007.01422.x,"Attempts to explain size variation in Drosophila and other small insects often focus on the larval stage and association between development time and size, but patterns are also influenced by direct selection on size-related traits in the adults. Here we use multiple field releases of Drosophila melanogaster to test the association between size and one component of field fitness, the ability of Drosophila to locate resources for feeding and breeding. We find antagonistic selection between wing length and thorax length in both males and females, such that capture at baits is higher for flies with relatively larger thorax lengths and smaller wings. However flies with large wings relative to thoraces disperse further as reflected in the longer distances moved to baits. These patterns did not depend strongly on weather conditions, suggesting that selection on adult size is at least partly independent of temperature. Antagonistic selection between size traits can generate changes in size along gradients if the distribution of resources in the environment varies and selects for different dispersal patterns, particularly as dispersal is relatively higher under warmer conditions.",2007,"R Hallas, M Barton, A R Weeks, C M Sgrò, M Blacket, E Ratna, S De Garis, A A Hoffmann"
Automatic channel unmixing for high-throughput quantitative analysis of fluorescence images,19547599,10.1364/oe.15.012306,"Laser-scanning microscopy allows rapid acquisition of multi-channel data, paving the way for high-throughput, high-content analysis of large numbers of images. An inherent problem of using multiple fluorescent dyes is overlapping emission spectra, which results in channel cross-talk and reduces the ability to extract quantitative measurements. Traditional unmixing methods rely on measuring channel cross-talk and using fixed acquisition parameters, but these requirements are not suited to high-throughput processing. Here we present a simple automatic method to correct for channel cross-talk in multi-channel images using image data only. The method is independent of the acquisition parameters but requires some spatial separation between different dyes in the image. We evaluate the method by comparing the cross-talk levels it estimates to those measured directly from a standard fluorescent slide. The method is then applied to a high-throughput analysis pipeline that measures nuclear volumes and relative expression of gene products from three-dimensional, multi-channel fluorescence images of whole Drosophila embryos. Analysis of images before unmixing revealed an aberrant spatial correlation between measured nuclear volumes and the gene expression pattern in the shorter wavelength channel.

The role of larval fat cells in adult Drosophila melanogaster,17337708,10.1242/jeb.001586,"In the life history of holometabolous insects, distinct developmental stages are tightly linked to feeding and non-feeding periods. The larval stage is characterized by extensive feeding, which supports the rapid growth of the animal and allows accumulation of energy stores, primarily in the larval fat body. In Drosophila melanogaster access to these stores during pupal development is possible because the larval fat body is preserved in the pupa as individual fat cells. These larval fat cells are refractive to autophagic cell death that removes most of the larval cells during metamorphosis. The larval fat cells are thought to persist into the adult stage and thus might also have a nutritional role in the young adult. We used cell markers to demonstrate that the fat cells in the young adult are in fact dissociated larval fat body cells, and we present evidence that these cells are eventually removed in the adult by a caspase cascade that leads to cell death. By genetically manipulating the lifespan of the larval fat cells, we demonstrate that these cells are nutritionally important during the early, non-feeding stage of adulthood. We experimentally blocked cell death of larval fat cells using the GAL4/UAS system and found that in newly eclosed adults starvation resistance increased from 58 h to 72 h. Starvation survival was highly correlated with the number of remaining larval fat cells. We discuss the implications of these results in terms of the overall nutritional status of the larva as an important factor in adult survival in environmental stresses such as starvation.",2007,"Allen G Gibbs, Jerell R Aguila, Justin Suszko, Deborah K Hoshizaki"
Modulation of pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cell phenotype in hypoxia: role of cGMP-dependent protein kinase,17322285,10.1152/ajplung.00143.2006,"Chronic hypoxia triggers pulmonary vascular remodeling, which is associated with a modulation of the vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) phenotype from a contractile, differentiated to a synthetic, dedifferentiated state. We previously reported that acute hypoxia represses cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) expression in ovine fetal pulmonary venous SMCs (FPVSMCs). Therefore, we tested if altered expression of PKG could explain SMC phenotype modulation after exposure to hypoxia. Hypoxia-induced reduction in PKG protein expression strongly correlated with the repressed expression of SMC phenotype markers, myosin heavy chain (MHC), calponin, vimentin, alpha-smooth muscle actin (alphaSMA), and thrombospondin (TSP), indicating that hypoxic exposure of SMC induced phenotype modulation to dedifferentiated state, and PKG may be involved in SMC phenotype modulation. PKG-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection in FPVSMCs significantly attenuated calponin, vimentin, and MHC expression, with no effect on alphaSMA and TSP. Treatment with 30 microM Drosophila Antennapedia (DT-3), a membrane-permeable peptide inhibitor of PKG, attenuated the expression of TSP, MHC, alphaSMA, vimentin, and calponin. The results from PKG siRNA and DT-3 studies indicate that hypoxia-induced reduction in protein expression was also similarly impacted by PKG inhibition. Overexpression of PKG in FPVSMCs by transfection with a full-length PKG construct tagged with green fluorescent fusion protein (PKG-GFP) reversed the effect of hypoxia on the expression of SMC phenotype marker proteins. These results suggest that PKG could be one of the determinants for the expression of SMC phenotype marker proteins and may be involved in the maintenance of the differentiated phenotype in pulmonary vascular SMCs in hypoxia.",2007,"Weilin Zhou, J Usha Raj, Chiranjib Dasgupta, Sewite Negash"

Shortly before I began graduate study, the development of nucleic acid hybridization made it possible to compare two nucleic acids whether or not their sequences were known. From this stemmed a progression of development in tools and techniques that continues to enhance our understanding of how chromosomes function. As my PhD project I contributed to this progression by developing in situ hybridization, a technique for hybridization to nucleic acids within their cellular context. Early studies with this technique initiated several lines of research, two of which I describe here, that I have pursued to this day. First, analysis of RNA populations by hybridization to polytene chromosomes (a proto-microarray-type experiment) led us to characterize levels of regulation during heat shock beyond those recognizable by puffing studies. We found also that one still-undeciphered major heat shock puff encodes a novel set of RNAs for which we propose a regulatory role. Second, localization of various multicopy DNA sequences has suggested roles for them in chromosome structure: Most recently we have found that Drosophila telomeres consist of and are maintained by special non-LTR (long terminal repeat) retrotransposons.",2007,Mary-Lou Pardue
Novel stimulus-induced calcium efflux in Drosophila mushroom bodies,17419759,10.1111/j.1460-9568.2007.05425.x,"The mushroom body (MB) is an important part of the Drosophila brain, and is involved in many behaviors, including olfactory learning and memory and some visual cognition. However, the physiological properties of MB neurons remain elusive. Here we used a calcium-imaging technique to study calcium signals in Drosophila MB. We found that, rather than increasing calcium spread, electrical stimuli dramatically decreased calcium signals in the terminals of MB fibers. This novel calcium decrease occurred at all developmental stages from larvae to adults, but was specific for certain regions of the MB neurons. GABA receptor blockade promoted calcium propagation through the MB fibers, but did not disrupt the stimulus-induced decrease in calcium. Furthermore, this decrease in calcium was independent of extracellular calcium concentration and was not due to altered uptake by intracellular calcium stores and mitochondria. Rather, we found that inhibition of sodium-calcium exchangers significantly attenuated the stimulus-induced decrease in calcium, whereas the decrease persisted when membrane calcium pumps were blocked. Our findings indicate that MB neurons exhibit a novel stimulus-induced calcium efflux, which may be importantly regulated by sodium-calcium exchangers in the Drosophila MB.",2007,"Aike Guo, Yueqing Peng"
Open channel block by Ca2+ underlies the voltage dependence of drosophila TRPL channel,17190901,10.1085/jgp.200609659,"The light-activated channels of Drosophila photoreceptors transient receptor potential (TRP) and TRP-like (TRPL) show voltage-dependent conductance during illumination. Recent studies implied that mammalian members of the TRP family, which belong to the TRPV and TRPM subfamilies, are intrinsically voltage-gated channels. However, it is unclear whether the Drosophila TRPs, which belong to the TRPC subfamily, share the same voltage-dependent gating mechanism. Exploring the voltage dependence of Drosophila TRPL expressed in S2 cells, we found that the voltage dependence of this channel is not an intrinsic property since it became linear upon removal of divalent cations. We further found that Ca(2+) blocked TRPL in a voltage-dependent manner by an open channel block mechanism, which determines the frequency of channel openings and constitutes the sole parameter that underlies its voltage dependence. Whole cell recordings from a Drosophila mutant expressing only TRPL indicated that Ca(2+) block also accounts for the voltage dependence of the native TRPL channels. The open channel block by Ca(2+) that we characterized is a useful mechanism to improve the signal to noise ratio of the response to intense light when virtually all the large conductance TRPL channels are blocked and only the low conductance TRP channels with lower Ca(2+) affinity are active.",2007,"Baruch Minke, Moshe Parnas, Ben Katz"
Cytotype regulation by telomeric P elements in Drosophila melanogaster: interactions with P elements from M' strains,17565961,10.1534/genetics.106.066670,"P strains of Drosophila are distinguished from M strains by having P elements in their genomes and also by having the P cytotype, a maternally inherited condition that strongly represses P-element-induced hybrid dysgenesis. The P cytotype is associated with P elements inserted near the left telomere of the X chromosome. Repression by the telomeric P elements TP5 and TP6 is significantly enhanced when these elements are crossed into M' strains, which, like P strains, carry P elements, but have little or no ability to repress dysgenesis. The telomeric and M' P elements must coexist in females for this enhanced repression ability to develop. However, once established, it is transmitted maternally to the immediate offspring independently of the telomeric P elements themselves. Females that carry a telomeric P element but that do not carry M' P elements may also transmit an ability to repress dysgenesis to their offspring independently of the telomeric P element. Cytotype regulation therefore involves a maternally transmissible product of telomeric P elements that can interact synergistically with products from paternally inherited M' P elements. This synergism between TP and M' P elements also appears to persist for at least one generation after the TP has been removed from the genotype.",2007,"Joseph W Goodman, Cecile Lamour, Wojciech Kraszkiewicz, Ryan Wolff, Don-Felix Ryzek, Jarad B Niemi, Michael J Simmons"
Self-alignments to detect mutually exclusive exon usage,18467774,,"The surprisingly low number of about 25,000 genes in the human genome [1] confirmed a fairly accurate estimate given by King and Jukes in 1969 based on population genetical arguments [2]. On the other hand, the number of different transcripts vastly exceeds gene number. This fact intensified the search for alternatively spliced genes. Recent results [1,3,4-7] suggest that more than 60% of the human genes are alternatively spliced, some of them with a myriad of different splice forms. Alternative splicing is found in all higher eukaryotic species in varying frequency. In this paper we focus on a particular form of alternative splicing, the so-called mutually exclusive exon usage (MEEU). In most known examples mutually exclusive exons are arranged in cassettes of highly similar exons suggesting that they have been derived by exon duplication [8-10]. Since classical gene-finding programs may fail to correctly predict such genes [11-16], we present a method, which is based on local similarity of exons, to detect gene candidates with mutually exclusive exon usage. We have screened the entire genome of D. melanogaster and found five new genes with MEEU in addition to eight previously described cases. Additional 1703 candidate regions of putative mutually exclusive exons were identified.",2007,"Friedrich Möller, Jürgen Kleffe, Martin Stephan, Thomas Wiehe"
Mutations of the Igbeta gene cause agammaglobulinemia in man,17709424,10.1084/jem.20070264,"Agammaglobulinemia is a rare primary immunodeficiency characterized by an early block of B cell development in the bone marrow, resulting in the absence of peripheral B cells and low/absent immunoglobulin serum levels. So far, mutations in Btk, mu heavy chain, surrogate light chain, Igalpha, and B cell linker have been found in 85-90% of patients with agammaglobulinemia. We report on the first patient with agammaglobulinemia caused by a homozygous nonsense mutation in Igbeta, which is a transmembrane protein that associates with Igalpha as part of the preBCR complex. Transfection experiments using Drosophila melanogaster S2 Schneider cells showed that the mutant Igbeta is no longer able to associate with Igalpha, and that assembly of the BCR complex on the cell surface is abrogated. The essential role of Igbeta for human B cell development was further demonstrated by immunofluorescence analysis of the patient's bone marrow, which showed a complete block of B cell development at the pro-B to preB transition.

Vascular biology and the sex of flies: regulation of vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation by wilms' tumor 1-associating protein,17936204,10.1016/j.tcm.2007.08.002,"Smooth muscle cells (SMCs) are called on to proliferate during vascular repair but must return to a nonproliferative state if remodeling is to terminate appropriately. One gene that has recently been implicated in the acquisition of SMC replicative quiescence is Wilms' tumor 1-associating protein (WTAP). Wilms' tumor 1-associating protein is a nuclear constituent of uncertain function that, as the name implies, interacts with the Wilms' tumor 1 tumor suppressor gene product (WT1). Wilms' tumor 1-associating protein is essential for embryonic development, and recent data suggest that WTAP regulates the proliferation of both SMCs and endothelial cells. In SMCs, WTAP appears to be antiproliferative, inhibiting G(1)-to-S phase cell cycle transition and also promoting apoptosis. These effects could be the result of WTAP suppressing the transcriptional activity of WT1 in SMCs. Interestingly, the Drosophila homologue of WTAP, fl(2)d, is a protein essential for alternative splicing regulation and sexual determination in this species. Wilms' tumor 1-associating protein may thus also play a role in messenger RNA processing in mammalian cells, either dependent on or independent of its interaction with WT1. The putative actions of WTAP as a regulator of transcriptional and posttranscriptional events and emerging evidence for a WTAP-WT1 axis in vascular cells suggest that WTAP is a vital and multifaceted regulator of vascular remodeling.",2007,"J Geoffrey Pickering, Luiz O Penalva, Theodore W Small"

Spliceosomal small nuclear RNA genes in 11 insect genomes,17095541,10.1261/rna.259207,"The removal of introns from the primary transcripts of protein-coding genes is accomplished by the spliceosome, a large macromolecular complex of which small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) are crucial components. Following the recent sequencing of the honeybee (Apis mellifera) genome, we used various computational methods, ranging from sequence similarity search to RNA secondary structure prediction, to search for putative snRNA genes (including their promoters) and to examine their pattern of conservation among 11 available insect genomes (A. mellifera, Tribolium castaneum, Bombyx mori, Anopheles gambiae, Aedes aegypti, and six Drosophila species). We identified candidates for all nine spliceosomal snRNA genes in all the analyzed genomes. All the species contain a similar number of snRNA genes, with the exception of A. aegypti, whose genome contains more U1, U2, and U5 genes, and A. mellifera, whose genome contains fewer U2 and U5 genes. We found that snRNA genes are generally more closely related to homologs within the same genus than to those in other genera. Promoter regions for all spliceosomal snRNA genes within each insect species share similar sequence motifs that are likely to correspond to the PSEA (proximal sequence element A), the binding site for snRNA activating protein complex, but these promoter elements vary in sequence among the five insect families surveyed here. In contrast to the other insect species investigated, Dipteran genomes are characterized by a rapid evolution (or loss) of components of the U12 spliceosome and a striking loss of U12-type introns.",2007,"Chiao-Feng Lin, Valer Gotea, Wojciech Makalowski, Kristina Hernandez, Stephen M Mount"
Twisted gastrulation loss-of-function analyses support its role as a BMP inhibitor during early Xenopus embryogenesis,12952901,10.1242/dev.00709,"BMP signals play important roles in the regulation of diverse events in development and in the adult. In amniotes, like the amphibian Xenopus laevis, BMPs promote ventral specification, while chordin and other BMP inhibitors expressed dorsally in the Spemann's organizer play roles in establishment and/or maintenance of this region as dorsal endomesoderm. The activities of chordin are in turn regulated by the secreted proteolytic enzymes BMP1 and Xolloid. Recently, we and others have identified the protein twisted gastrulation (TSG) as a soluble BMP modulator that functions by modifying chordin activity. Overexpression and genetic analyses in Drosophila, Xenopus and zebrafish together with in vitro biochemical studies suggest that TSG might act as a BMP antagonist; but there is also evidence that TSG may promote BMP signaling. Here we report examination of the in vivo function of TSG in early Xenopus development using a loss-of-function approach. We show that reducing TSG expression using antisense TSG morpholino oligonucleotides (MOs) results in moderate head defects. These defects can be rescued both by a TSG that cannot be inhibited by the MO, and by the BMP antagonists chordin and noggin. Furthermore, while neither the onset of gastrulation nor the expression of marker genes are affected in early gastrulae, dorsal marker gene expression is reduced at the expense of expanded ventral marker gene expression beginning at mid to late gastrula stage. TSG-MO and Chd-MOs also cooperate to strongly repress head formation. Finally, we note that the loss of TSG function results in a shift in tissue responsiveness to the BMP inhibitory function of chordin in both animal caps and the ventral marginal zone, a result that implies that the activity of TSG may be required for chordin to efficiently inhibit BMPs in these developmental contexts. These data, taken together with the biochemistry and overexpression studies, argue that TSG plays an important role in regulating the potency of chordin's BMP inhibitory activity and TSG and chordin act together to regulate the extent of dorsoanterior development of early frog embryos.",2003,"Ira L Blitz, Chenbei Chang, Ken W Y Cho"

Several so-called ""clock genes"" are expressed in specific neurons in the lateral and dorsal brain where they generate cell-autonomous molecular circadian oscillations. These clusters are connected with each other and contribute differentially to the control of behavioral rhythmicity.

An empty Drosophila stem cell niche reactivates the proliferation of ectopic cells,12676994,10.1073/pnas.0830856100,"Stem cells are thought to reside in regulatory microenvironments (""niches"") generated by stable stromal neighbors. To investigate the significance of empty niches vacated by stem cell loss, we studied Drosophila ovarioles, which maintain two to three germ-line stem cells in a niche requiring adhesive stromal cap cells and Decapentaplegic signals. After experimentally emptying the germ-line stem cell niche, cap cell activity persists for several weeks. Initially, somatic inner germarium sheath cells enter the empty niche, respond to Dpp, but fail to divide. Subsequently, follicle cell progenitors, including somatic stem cells enter the niche, respond to Dpp, and proliferate as long as cap cells remain. Proliferation requires the normal hedgehog signal of the somatic stem cells as well as proximity to the niche. Thus, empty niches can persist, signal incoming cells, and support ectopic proliferation. Similar events may underlie some disease states.",2003,"Allan Spradling, Toshie Kai"
Math1 gene transfer generates new cochlear hair cells in mature guinea pigs in vivo,12805278,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.23-11-04395.2003,"Hair cell loss in the mammalian cochlea is irreversible and results in permanent hearing loss. Math1, the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor homolog of the Drosophila atonal gene, is a positive regulator of hair cell differentiation during cochlear development. Developing hair cells express Math1, and nonsensory cells do not. We set out to determine the outcome of overexpression of Math1 in nonsensory cells of the cochlea on the phenotype of these cells. We demonstrate that in vivo inoculation of adenovirus with the Math1 gene insert into the endolymph of the mature guinea pig cochlea results in Math1 overexpression in nonsensory cochlear cells, as evident from the presence of Math1 protein in supporting cells of the organ of Corti and in adjacent nonsensory epithelial cells. Math1 overexpression leads to the appearance of immature hair cells in the organ of Corti and new hair cells adjacent to the organ of Corti in the interdental cell, inner sulcus, and Hensen cell regions. Axons are extended from the bundle of auditory nerve toward some of the new hair cells, suggesting that the new cells attract auditory neurons. We conclude that nonsensory cells in the mature cochlea retain the competence to generate new hair cells after overexpression of Math1 in vivo and that Math1 is necessary and sufficient to direct hair cell differentiation in these mature nonsensory cells.",2003,"Shin-Ichi Ishimoto, Kohei Kawamoto, Douglas E Brough, Ryosei Minoda, Yehoash Raphael"

They are required at different stages of oogenesis for egg chamber formation and establishment of both the anteroposterior and planar polarities of the follicular epithelium. We show that definition of polar cell pairs is a progressive process since early stage egg chambers contain a cluster of several polar cell marker-expressing cells at each pole, while as of stage 5, they contain invariantly two pairs of such cells. Using cell lineage analysis, we demonstrate that these pre-polar cell clusters have a polyclonal origin and derive specifically from the polar cell lineage, rather than from that giving rise to follicular cells. In addition, selection of two polar cells from groups of pre-polar cells occurs via an apoptosis-dependent mechanism and is required for correct patterning of the anterior follicular epithelium of vitellogenic egg chambers.",2003,"Anne-Marie Pret, Florence Besse"

"Orbit/Mast, the CLASP orthologue of Drosophila, is required for asymmetric stem cell and cystocyte divisions and development of the polarised microtubule network that interconnects oocyte and nurse cells during oogenesis",12538517,10.1242/dev.00315,"Drosophila oocyte differentiation is preceded by the formation of a polarised 16-cell cyst from a single progenitor stem cell as a result of four rounds of asymmetric mitosis followed by incomplete cytokinesis. We show that the Orbit/Mast microtubule-associated protein is required at several stages in the formation of such polarised 16-cell cysts. In wild-type cysts, the Orbit/Mast protein not only associates with the mitotic spindle and its poles, but also with the central spindle (spindle remnant), ring canal and fusome, suggesting it participates in interactions between these structures. In orbit mutants, the stem cells and their associated fusomes are eventually lost as Orbit/Mast protein is depleted. The mitotic spindles of those cystocytes that do divide are either diminutive or monopolar, and do not make contact with the fusome. Moreover, the spindle remnants and ring canals fail to differentiate correctly in such cells and the structure of fusome is compromised. The Orbit/Mast protein thus appears to facilitate multiple interactions of the fusome with mitotic spindles and ring canals. This ensures correct growth of the fusome into a branched asymmetrically distributed organelle that is pre-determinative of 16-cell cyst formation and oocyte fate specification. Finally the Orbit/Mast protein is required during mid-oogenesis for the organisation of the polarised microtubule network inside the 16-cell cyst that ensures oocyte differentiation. The localisation of CLIP-190 to such microtubules and to the fusome is dependent upon Orbit/Mast to which it is complexed.",2003,"Gemma Brown, William Palframan, Yoshihiro H Inoue, David M Glover, Endre Máthé"
A novel cryptic translocation t(12;17)(p13;p12-p13) in a secondary acute myeloid leukemia results in a fusion of the ETV6 gene and the antisense strand of the PER1 gene,12661008,10.1002/gcc.10175,"The ETV6 gene is a member of the ETS family of transcription factors and the main target of chromosomal rearrangements affecting chromosome band 12p13. To date, more than 15 fusion partners of ETV6 have been characterized at the molecular level. Most of these fusions encode chimeric proteins with oncogenic properties. However, some of the translocations do not produce a functional fusion protein, but may induce ectopic expression of oncogenes located close to the breakpoint. We herein report the characterization and cloning of a novel cryptic translocation, t(12;17)(p13;p12-p13), occurring in a patient with an acute myeloid leukemia evolving from a chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Cytogenetic analysis suggested the presence of a deletion of the short arm of chromosome 12, del(12)(p13), in three of the five metaphase cells analyzed.

By FISH, the breakpoints could be localized in intron 1 of ETV6 and centromeric to TP53. By 3' rapid amplification of cDNA ends-polymerase chain reaction (3' RACE-PCR), a fusion transcript between exon 1 of ETV6 and the antisense strand of PER1 (period homolog 1, Drosophila), a circadian clock gene, could be identified. This ETV6-PER1 (antisense PER1 strand) fusion transcript does not produce a fusion protein, and no other fusion transcripts could be detected.

Control of axon elongation via an SDF-1alpha/Rho/mDia pathway in cultured cerebellar granule neurons,12707308,10.1083/jcb.200210149,"Rho-GTPase has been implicated in axon outgrowth. However, not all of the critical steps controlled by Rho have been well characterized. Using cultured cerebellar granule neurons, we show here that stromal cell-derived factor (SDF)-1alpha, a neural chemokine, is a physiological ligand that can turn on two distinct Rho-dependent pathways with opposite consequences. A low concentration of the ligand stimulated a Rho-dependent pathway that mediated facilitation of axon elongation. In contrast, Rho/ROCK activation achieved by a higher concentration of SDF-1alpha caused repression of axon formation and induced no more increase in axon length. However, even at this higher concentration a Rho-dependent axon elongating activity could be recovered upon removal of ROCK activity using Y-27632. SDF-1alpha-induced axon elongating activity under ROCK inhibition was replicated by the dominant-active form of the mammalian homologue of the Drosophila gene Diaphanous (mDia)1 and counteracted by its dominant-negative form.

Extrachromosomal circular DNA of tandemly repeated genomic sequences in Drosophila,12799349,10.1101/gr.907603,"One characteristic of genomic plasticity is the presence of extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA). This DNA is found in various eukaryotes from yeast to humans, and its levels are elevated by exposure to carcinogens. eccDNA is heterogeneous in size and composed of chromosomal sequences. In this study we used two-dimensional gel electrophoresis to detect and characterize eccDNA in Drosophila. We found eccDNA throughout the fly's life cycle. These molecules comprise up to 10% of the total repetitive DNA content, and their size ranges from <1 kb to >20 kb. The eccDNA population contains circular multimers of tandemly repeated genes such as histones, rDNA, Stellate, and the Suppressor of Stellate. Multimers of centromeric heterochromatin sequences are included in eccDNA as well. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that intramolecular homologous recombination between direct tandem repeats is a favorite mechanism for eccDNA formation. The level of eccDNA increased following MMS treatment of wild-type larvae, consistent with phenomena observed in cultured mammalian cells. This shows mutagen-induced eccDNA formation in the context of the whole organism for the first time.

In this study, we have isolated the genomic clone containing the entire mrjp1 gene and determined its sequence. The mrjp1 gene sequence spans over 3038 bp and contains six exons separated by five introns. Seven mismatches between the mrjp1 gene sequence and two previously independently published cDNA sequences were found, but these differences do not lead to any change in the deduced amino acid sequence of MRJP1. With the aid of inverse polymerase chain reaction we obtained sequences flanking the 5' ends of other mrjp genes (mrjp2, mrjp3, mrjp4 and mrjp5). Putative promoters were predicted upstream of all mrjp genes (including mrjp1). The predicted promoters contain the TATA motif (TATATATT), highly conserved both in sequence and position. Ultraspiracle (USP) transcription factor (TF) binding sites in putative promoter regions and clusters of dead ringer TF binding sites upstream of these promoters were predicted computationally. We propose that USP, as a juvenile hormone (JH) binding TF, might possibly act as a mediator of mrjp expression in response to JH. Mrjp1's genomic locus is predicted to encode an antisense transcript, partially overlapping with five mrjp1 exons and entirely overlapping with the putative promoter and predicted transcriptional start point of mrjp1. This finding may shed light on the mechanisms of regulation of mrjps expression. Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA revealed that all so far known members of mrjp gene family (mrjp1, mrjp2, mrjp3, mrjp4 and mrjp5) are present as single-copy genes per haploid honeybee genome.

Noncircadian regulation and function of clock genes period and timeless in oogenesis of Drosophila melanogaster,14667147,10.1177/0748730403259108,"Circadian clock genes are ubiquitously expressed in the nervous system and peripheral tissues of complex animals. While clock genes in the brain are essential for behavioral rhythms, the physiological roles of these genes in the periphery are not well understood. Constitutive expression of the clock gene period was reported in the ovaries of Drosophila melanogaster; however, its molecular interactions and functional significance remained unknown. This study demonstrates that period (per) and timeless (tim) are involved in a novel noncircadian function in the ovary. PER and TIM are constantly expressed in the follicle cells enveloping young oocytes. Genetic evidence suggests that PER and TIM interact in these cells, yet they do not translocate to the nucleus. The levels of TIM and PER in the ovary are affected neither by light nor by the lack of clock-positive elements Clock (Clk) and cycle (cyc). Taken together, these data suggest that per and tim are regulated differently in follicle cells than in clock cells. Experimental evidence suggests that a novel fitness-related phenotype may be linked to noncircadian expression of clock genes in the ovaries. Mated females lacking either per or tim show nearly a 50% decline in progeny, and virgin females show a similar decline in the production of mature oocytes. Disruption of circadian mechanism by either the depletion of TIM via constant light treatment or continuous expression of PER via GAL4/UAS expression system has no adverse effect on the production of mature oocytes.",2003,"J M Giebultowicz, L M Beaver, B L Rush, B O Gvakharia"

Here we report on a large set of recombinant inbred (RI) D. melanogaster lines that exhibit approximately a fivefold range of average adult longevities. Understanding the factors responsible for the differences in longevity, particularly the characteristics of the longest-lived lines, can provide fundamental insights into the mechanistic correlates of aging. In ectothermic organisms, longevity is often inversely correlated with metabolic rate, suggesting the a priori hypothesis that long-lived lines will have low resting metabolic rates. We conducted approximately 6000 measurements of CO2 production in individual male flies aged 5, 16, 29, and 47 days postemergence and simultaneously measured the weight of individual flies and life spans in populations of each line. Even though there was a wide range of longevities, there was no evidence of an inverse relationship between the variables. The increased longevity of long-lived lines is not mediated through reduction of metabolic activity. In Drosophila, it is possible to both maintain a normal metabolic rate and achieve long life.

A yeast-based complementation assay in yeast mutants containing a disrupted INO1gene for yeast MIPS confirmed that the SeMIPS1 gene encodes a functional MIPS. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that the SeMIPS1 gene diverged as a different subfamily or family member. Southern hybridization revealed several copies of the SeMIPS1 gene present in the sesame genome and northern blotting indicated that expression of the SeMIPS1gene may be organ specific. Salt stress during sesame seed germination had an adverse influence on transcription of SeMIPS1and greatly reduced transcript levels as the duration of exposure to a saline environment increased and NaCl concentration increased.

We show that avoidance of naturally aversive odorants is impaired in flies harboring mutations in Calreticulin. Calreticulin mutants have broad defects in odor avoidance without abnormalities in antennal responses to odorants, alterations in central nervous system structure, or deficits in overall locomotor abilities. Interestingly, Calreticulin mutants exhibit defects in behavioral responses to odorants at low strength, whereas responses to higher odorant concentrations are preserved in these animals.

Cell migration and programmed cell death of Drosophila germ cells,12814944,10.1111/j.1749-6632.2003.tb03215.x,"Cell migration and programmed cell death are essential components of animal development and homeostasis, and the germ cells of Drosophila provide a simple genetic system to study the molecular mechanisms that govern these important cellular processes. Detailed descriptions of germ cell migration in Drosophila were accomplished long ago, but most genetic and molecular analyses of the process have occurred within the past 10 years. A few of the genes required for germ cell migration have been identified, and a very interesting picture is emerging. However, a process as complex as cell migration must involve the functions of many more molecules. In addition, cell migration and cell death mechanisms are often linked, as it is important to eliminate cells that are misplaced and could present a danger to the organism. In Drosophila, genes involved in germ cell migration can also affect programmed cell death. Currently, very little is known about how germ cells ectopic to the gonads are eliminated. To date, only four genes have been reported with roles in germ cell death, and three of these have additional functions in germ cell pathfinding. The nature of the cell death program has not been elucidated. Here, I provide a brief review of Drosophila germ cell migration and programmed cell death at both the descriptive and molecular levels. Many questions remain to be answered, but advances made in recent years are providing useful insights into these critical biological phenomena.",2003,Clark R Coffman
"Functional conservation of the sex-lethal sex determining promoter, Sxl-Pe, in Drosophila virilis",12739140,10.1007/s00427-003-0304-1,"The primary sex determination signal in Drosophila melanogaster, the ratio of X chromosomes to autosomes, sets the activity state of the switch gene, Sex-lethal ( Sxl), by regulating the establishment promoter, m-Sxl-Pe. We have identified and characterized the establishment promoter, v-Sxl-Pe, of the distantly related species Drosophila virilis. Like melanogaster, the virilis Sxl-Pe is organized into four sub-domains: the Sxl-Pe mRNA leader and exon E1 of Sxl protein, the core promoter, the sex-specific element and the augmentation element. The core promoter and sex-specific element of v-Sxl-Pe show considerable sequence similarity to m-Sxl-Pe and contain target sites for components of the X/A signaling system. While the augmentation element of v-Sxl-Pe also has sequence motifs that could function as target sites for the X/A signaling system, it shows little similarity to the melanogaster augmentation element. Functional studies reveal that v-Sxl-Pe drives sex-specific expression in D. melanogaster embryos and that the activity of the virilis promoter is controlled by known components of the melanogaster X/A counting system. Although v-Sxl-Pe responds appropriately to the melanogaster sex determination signal, it is less active than Sxl-Pe from melanogaster. Unexpectedly, the reduced activity is due to differences in the activity of the conserved core promoter, while the non-conserved augmentation element functions effectively. These findings suggest that low-affinity target sites for the X/A counting system are critical for the functioning of Sxl-Pe.",2003,"Timothy Morgan Jinks, Gretchen Calhoun, Paul Schedl"

Echinoid facilitates Notch pathway signalling during Drosophila neurogenesis through functional interaction with Delta,14627723,10.1242/dev.00882,"The Notch intercellular signalling pathway is important throughout development, and its components are modulated by a variety of cellular and molecular mechanisms. Ligand and receptor trafficking are tightly controlled, although context-specific regulation of this is incompletely understood. We show that during sense organ precursor specification in Drosophila, the cell adhesion molecule Echinoid colocalises extensively with the Notch ligand, Delta, at the cell membrane and in early endosomes. Echinoid facilitates efficient Notch pathway signalling. Cultured cell experiments suggest that Echinoid is associated with the cis-endocytosis of Delta, and is therefore linked to the signalling events that have been shown to require such Delta trafficking. Consistent with this, overexpression of Echinoid protein causes a reduction in Delta level at the membrane and in endosomes. In vivo and cell culture studies suggest that homophilic interaction of Echinoid on adjacent cells is necessary for its function.",2003,"Andrew P Jarman, Bridget Lovegrove, Emma L Rawlins"
Identification of SATB2 as the cleft palate gene on 2q32-q33,12915443,10.1093/hmg/ddg248,"Cytogenetic evidence, in the form of deletions and balanced translocations, points to the existence of a locus on 2q32-q33, for which haploinsufficiency results in isolated cleft palate (CPO). Here we show by high-resolution FISH mapping of two de novo CPO-associated translocations involving 2q32-q33 that one breakpoint interrupts the transcription unit of the gene encoding the DNA-binding protein SATB2 (formerly KIAA1034). The breakpoint in the other translocation is located 130 kb 3' to the SATB2 polyadenylation signal, within a conserved region of non-coding DNA. The SATB2 gene is transcribed in a telomeric to centromeric direction and lies in a gene-poor region of 2q32-q33; the nearest confirmed gene is 1.26 Mb centromeric to the SATB2 polyadenylation signal. SATB2-encoding transcripts are assembled from 11 exons that span 191 kb of genomic DNA. They encode a protein of 733 amino acids that has two CUT domains and a homeodomain and shows a remarkable degree of evolutionary conservation, with only three amino acid substitutions between mouse and human. This protein belongs to the same family as SATB1, a nuclear matrix-attachment region binding protein implicated in transcriptional control and control of chromatin remodelling. There are also sequence similarities to the Drosophila protein DVE. Whole mount in situ hybridization to mouse embryos shows site- and stage-specific expression of SATB2 in the developing palate. Despite the strong evidence supporting an important role for SATB2 in palate development, mutation analysis of 70 unrelated patients with CPO did not reveal any coding region variants.",2003,"Patrick Wightman, Caroline Hayward, Helen Firth, Philippe Gautier, David T Bonthron, Ian M Carr, Alex F Markham, Jack P Leek, David R FitzPatrick, Niolette McGill, Lorna McLaren, Kathy Williamson, Judy A Fantes"
Drosophila TIMP is a potent inhibitor of MMPs and TACE: similarities in structure and function to TIMP-3,14567681,10.1021/bi035358x,"The four tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) are endogenous inhibitors that regulate the activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and certain disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM) family proteases in mammals. The protease inhibitory activity is present in the N-terminal domains of TIMPs (N-TIMPs). In this work, the N-terminal inhibitory domain of the only TIMP produced by Drosophila (dN-TIMP) was expressed in Escherichia coli and folded in vitro. The purified recombinant protein is a potent inhibitor of human MMPs, including membrane-type 1-MMP, although it lacks a disulfide bond that is conserved in all other known N-TIMPs. Titration with the catalytic domain of human MMP-3 [MMP-3(DeltaC)] showed that dN-TIMP prepared by this method is correctly folded and fully active. dN-TIMP also inhibits, in vitro, the activity of the only two MMPs of Drosophila, dm1- and dm2-MMPs, indicating that the Drosophila TIMP is an endogenous inhibitor of the Drosophila MMPs. dN-TIMP resembles mammalian N-TIMP-3 in strongly inhibiting human tumor necrosis factor-alpha-converting enzyme (TACE/ADAM17) but is a weak inhibitor of human ADAM10. Models of the structures of dN-TIMP and N-TIMP-3 are strikingly similar in surface charge distribution, which may explain their functional similarity. Although the gene duplication events that led to the evolutionary development of the four mammalian TIMPs might be expected to be associated with functional specialization, Timp-3 appears to have conserved most of the functions of the ancestral TIMP gene.",2003,"Keith Brew, Zhihong Xie, Shuo Wei, Elena Filenova"
Expression of the yeast NADH dehydrogenase Ndi1 in Drosophila confers increased lifespan independently of dietary restriction,20435911,10.1073/pnas.0911539107,"Mutations in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation complex I are associated with multiple pathologies, and complex I has been proposed as a crucial regulator of animal longevity. In yeast, the single-subunit NADH dehydrogenase Ndi1 serves as a non-proton-translocating alternative enzyme that replaces complex I, bringing about the reoxidation of intramitochondrial NADH. We have created transgenic strains of Drosophila that express yeast NDI1 ubiquitously. Mitochondrial extracts from NDI1-expressing flies displayed a rotenone-insensitive NADH dehydrogenase activity, and functionality of the enzyme in vivo was confirmed by the rescue of lethality resulting from RNAi knockdown of complex I. NDI1 expression increased median, mean, and maximum lifespan independently of dietary restriction, and with no change in sirtuin activity. NDI1 expression mitigated the aging associated decline in respiratory capacity and the accompanying increase in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production, and resulted in decreased accumulation of markers of oxidative damage in aged flies.

In the last years, immense progress has been achieved by combining neurogenetic tools with neurophysiology, anatomy, chemistry, and behavioral assays. One of the most important tasks for a fruit fly is to find a substrate for eating and laying eggs. To perform this task the fly is dependent on olfactory cues emitted by suitable substrates as e.g. decaying fruit. In addition, in this area, considerable progress has been made during the last years, and more and more natural and behaviorally active ligands have been identified. The future challenge is to tie the progress in different fields together to give us a better understanding of how a fly really behaves. Not in a test tube, but in nature.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, oxidative stress markers, DNA damage and apoptotic cell death end points were measured in them. A significant increase in DNA damage was concomitant with apoptotic mode of cell death in 15.0 microg/L CP-treated organisms for 24 and 48 h. Depolarization in mitochondrial membrane potential and increased casapase-3 and caspase-9 activities in these organisms indicated both as potential targets of CP. A significant positive correlation was observed among ROS generation, apoptosis and DNA damage.

Drosophila melanogaster lipins are tissue-regulated and developmentally regulated and present specific subcellular distributions,20977671,10.1111/j.1742-4658.2010.07883.x,"Lipins constitute a novel family of Mg(2+)-dependent phosphatidate phosphatases that catalyze the dephosphorylation of phosphatidic acid to yield diacylglycerol, an important intermediate in lipid metabolism and cell signaling. Whereas a single lipin is detected in less complex organisms, in mammals there are distinct lipin isoforms and paralogs that are differentially expressed among tissues. Compatible with organism tissue complexity, we show that the single Drosophila Lpin1 ortholog (CG8709, here named DmLpin) expresses at least three isoforms (DmLpinA, DmLpinK and DmLpinJ) in a temporal and spatially regulated manner. The highest levels of lipin in the fat body, where DmLpinA and DmLpinK are expressed, correlate with the highest levels of triacylglycerol (TAG) measured in this tissue. DmLpinK is the most abundant isoform in the central nervous system, where TAG levels are significantly lower than in the fat body. In the testis, where TAG levels are even lower, DmLpinJ is the predominant isoform. Together, these data suggest that DmLpinA might be the isoform that is mainly involved in TAG production, and that DmLpinK and DmLpinJ could perform other cellular functions. In addition, we demonstrate by immunofluorescence that lipins are most strongly labeled in the perinuclear region of the fat body and ventral ganglion cells. In visceral muscles of the larval midgut and adult testis, lipins present a sarcomeric distribution. In the ovary chamber, the lipin signal is concentrated in the internal rim of the ring canal.

Estimating divergence parameters with small samples from a large number of loci,19917765,10.1534/genetics.109.110528,"Most methods for studying divergence with gene flow rely upon data from many individuals at few loci. Such data can be useful for inferring recent population history but they are unlikely to contain sufficient information about older events. However, the growing availability of genome sequences suggests a different kind of sampling scheme, one that may be more suited to studying relatively ancient divergence. Data sets extracted from whole-genome alignments may represent very few individuals but contain a very large number of loci. To take advantage of such data we developed a new maximum-likelihood method for genomic data under the isolation-with-migration model. Unlike many coalescent-based likelihood methods, our method does not rely on Monte Carlo sampling of genealogies, but rather provides a precise calculation of the likelihood by numerical integration over all genealogies. We demonstrate that the method works well on simulated data sets. We also consider two models for accommodating mutation rate variation among loci and find that the model that treats mutation rates as random variables leads to better estimates. We applied the method to the divergence of Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans and detected a low, but statistically significant, signal of gene flow from D. simulans to D. melanogaster.",2010,"Jody Hey, Yong Wang"
Spectrin mutations that cause spinocerebellar ataxia type 5 impair axonal transport and induce neurodegeneration in Drosophila,20368622,10.1083/jcb.200905158,"Spinocerebellar ataxia type 5 (SCA5) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in the SPBTN2 gene encoding beta-III-spectrin. To investigate the molecular basis of SCA5, we established a series of transgenic Drosophila models that express human beta-III-spectrin or fly beta-spectrin proteins containing SCA5 mutations. Expression of the SCA5 mutant spectrin in the eye causes a progressive neurodegenerative phenotype, and expression in larval neurons results in posterior paralysis, reduced synaptic terminal growth, and axonal transport deficits. These phenotypes are genetically enhanced by both dynein and dynactin loss-of-function mutations. In summary, we demonstrate that SCA5 mutant spectrin causes adult-onset neurodegeneration in the fly eye and disrupts fundamental intracellular transport processes that are likely to contribute to this progressive neurodegenerative disease.",2010,"Min-gang Li, Sarah E Mische, Damaris N Lorenzo, Karen R Armbrust, Thomas S Hays, Laura P W Ranum"
Model-based method for transcription factor target identification with limited data,20385836,10.1073/pnas.0914285107,"We present a computational method for identifying potential targets of a transcription factor (TF) using wild-type gene expression time series data. For each putative target gene we fit a simple differential equation model of transcriptional regulation, and the model likelihood serves as a score to rank targets. The expression profile of the TF is modeled as a sample from a Gaussian process prior distribution that is integrated out using a nonparametric Bayesian procedure. This results in a parsimonious model with relatively few parameters that can be applied to short time series datasets without noticeable overfitting. We assess our method using genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-chip) and loss-of-function mutant expression data for two TFs, Twist, and Mef2, controlling mesoderm development in Drosophila. Lists of top-ranked genes identified by our method are significantly enriched for genes close to bound regions identified in the ChIP-chip data and for genes that are differentially expressed in loss-of-function mutants. Targets of Twist display diverse expression profiles, and in this case a model-based approach performs significantly better than scoring based on correlation with TF expression. Our approach is found to be comparable or superior to ranking based on mutant differential expression scores. Also, we show how integrating complementary wild-type spatial expression data can further improve target ranking performance.",2010,"Antti Honkela, Eileen E M Furlong, Charles Girardot, Ya-Hsin Liu, Magnus Rattray, E Hilary Gustafson, Neil D Lawrence"

When transgenically expressing its wild-type myosin isoform (Tr-WT) the TDT is equivalent to a very fast vertebrate muscle. TDT has a V(slack) equal to 6.1 +/- 0.3 ML/s at 15 degrees C, a steep tension-pCa curve, isometric tension of 37 +/- 3 mN/mm(2), and maximum power production at 26% of isometric tension. Transgenically expressing an embryonic myosin isoform in the TDT muscle increased isometric tension 1.4-fold, but decreased V(slack) 50% resulting in no significant difference in maximum power production compared to Tr-WT. Drosophila expressing embryonic myosin jumped <50% as far as Tr-WT that, along with comparisons to frog jump muscle studies, suggests fast muscle shortening velocity is relatively more important than high tension generation for Drosophila jumping.",2010,"Douglas M Swank, Catherine C Eldred, Dimitre R Simeonov, David T Corr, Chaoxing Yang, Ryan A Koppes"
"Dosage-sensitive regulation of cohesin chromosome binding and dynamics by Nipped-B, Pds5, and Wapl",20696838,10.1128/MCB.00642-10,"The cohesin protein complex holds sister chromatids together to ensure proper chromosome segregation upon cell division and also regulates gene transcription. Partial loss of the Nipped-B protein that loads cohesin onto chromosomes, or the Pds5 protein required for sister chromatid cohesion, alters gene expression and organism development, without affecting chromosome segregation. Knowing if a reduced Nipped-B or Pds5 dosage changes how much cohesin binds chromosomes, or the stability with which it binds, is critical information for understanding how cohesin regulates transcription. We addressed this question by in vivo fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) with Drosophila salivary glands. Cohesin, Nipped-B, and Pds5 all bind chromosomes in both weak and stable modes, with residence half-lives of some 20 seconds and 6 min, respectively. Reducing the Nipped-B dosage decreases the amount of stable cohesin without affecting its chromosomal residence time, and reducing the Pds5 dosage increases the amount of stable cohesin. This argues that Nipped-B and Pds5 regulate transcription by controlling how much cohesin binds DNA in the stable mode, and not binding affinity. We also found that Nipped-B, Pds5, and the Wapl protein that interacts with Pds5 all play unique roles in cohesin chromosome binding.",2010,"Maria Gause, Dale Dorsett, Ziva Misulovin, Amy Bilyeu"
NG peptides: a novel family of neurophysin-associated neuropeptides,20303398,10.1016/j.gene.2010.03.004,"Neurophysins are prohormone-derived polypeptides that are required for biosynthesis of the neurohypophyseal hormones vasopressin and oxytocin. Accordingly, mutations in the neurophysin domain of the human vasopressin gene can cause diabetes insipidus. The association of neurophysins with vasopressin/oxytocin-type peptides dates back to the common ancestor of bilaterian animals and until recently it was thought to be unique. This textbook perspective on neurophysins changed with the discovery of a gene in the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (phylum Echinodermata) encoding a precursor protein comprising a neurophysin domain in association with NGFFFamide, a myoactive neuropeptide that is structurally unrelated to vasopressin/oxytocin-type neuropeptides (Elphick, M.R., Rowe, M.L., 2009. NGFFFamide and echinotocin: structurally unrelated myoactive neuropeptides derived from neurophysin-containing precursors in sea urchins. J. Exp. Biol. 212, 1067-1077). What is not known, however, is when and how the association of neurophysin with NGFFFamide-like neuropeptides originated. Here I report the discovery of genes encoding proteins comprising a neurophysin domain in association with putative NGFFFamide-like peptides in the hemichordate Saccoglossus kowalevskii (NGFWNamide and NGFYNamide) and in the cephalochordate Branchiostoma floridae (SFRNGVamide). Together with NGFFFamide, these peptides constitute a novel family of neuropeptides in invertebrate deuterostomes that are derived from neurophysin-containing precursors and that have the sequence motif NG - ""NG peptides"". Genes encoding NG peptides in association with neurophysin were not found in protostomes, urochordates or vertebrates. Interestingly, however, SFRNGVamide is identical to the N-terminal region of neuropeptide S, a peptide that modulates arousal and anxiety in mammals, whilst NGFFFamide shares sequence similarity with SIFamide (AYRKPPFNGSIFamide), a neuropeptide that regulates sexual behaviour in Drosophila. Collectively, these data indicate that in an ancestor of extant deuterostomes a remarkable and unique event in the evolution of neuropeptide signalling systems occurred when a neurophysin-encoding exon(s) derived from a vasopressin/oxytocin-type neuropeptide gene became transcriptionally linked with another family of neuropeptides - NG peptides.",2010,Maurice R Elphick

Most of the evidence for this model comes from the use of multivalent ligands. This raises the possibility that the activation being measured is that of increased clustering of the integrin rather than affinity. Using a newly developed assay that probes integrins on the surface of cells with only monovalent ligands prior to fixation, I do not find increases in affinity of alphaIIbbeta3 integrins by talin head fragments in Chinese hamster ovary cells, nor do I observe affinity increases in human platelets stimulated with thrombin. Binding to a multivalent ligand does increase in both of these cases. This assay does report affinity increases induced by either Mn(2+), a cytoplasmic domain mutant (D723R) in the cytoplasmic domain of beta3, or preincubation with a peptide ligand. These results reconcile the previously observed differences between talin effects on integrin activation in Drosophila and vertebrate systems and suggest new models for talin regulation of integrin activity in human platelets.",2010,Thomas A Bunch
Artificial triple Wolbachia infection in Aedes albopictus yields a new pattern of unidirectional cytoplasmic incompatibility,20601501,10.1128/AEM.00218-10,"Obligately intracellular Wolbachia bacteria infect numerous invertebrates and often manipulate host reproduction to facilitate the spread of infection. An example of reproductive manipulation is Wolbachia-induced cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI), which occurs commonly in insects. This CI has been the focus both of basic scientific studies of naturally occurring invasion events and of applied investigations on the use of Wolbachia as a vehicle to drive desired genotypes into insect populations (""gene drive"" or ""population replacement"" strategies). The latter application requires an ability to generate artificial infections that cause a pattern of unidirectional incompatibility with the targeted host population. A suggested target of population replacement strategies is the mosquito Aedes albopictus (Asian tiger mosquito), an important invasive pest and disease vector. Aedes albopictus individuals are naturally ""superinfected"" with two Wolbachia types: wAlbA and wAlbB. Thus, generating a strain that is unidirectionally incompatible with field populations requires the introduction of an additional infection into the preexisting superinfection. Although prior reports demonstrate an ability to transfer Wolbachia infections to A. albopictus artificially, including both intra- and interspecific Wolbachia transfers, previous efforts have not generated a strain capable of invading natural populations. Here we describe the generation of a stable triple infection by introducing Wolbachia wRi from Drosophila simulans into a naturally superinfected A. albopictus strain. The triple-infected strain displays a pattern of unidirectional incompatibility with the naturally infected strain. This unidirectional CI, combined with a high fidelity of maternal inheritance and low fecundity effects, suggests that the artificial cytotype could serve as an appropriate vehicle for gene drive.",2010,"David R Mercer, Yuqing Fu, Laurent Gavotte, Stephen L Dobson"
"Bicaudal D2, dynein, and kinesin-1 associate with nuclear pore complexes and regulate centrosome and nuclear positioning during mitotic entry",20386726,10.1371/journal.pbio.1000350,"BICD2 is one of the two mammalian homologues of the Drosophila Bicaudal D, an evolutionarily conserved adaptor between microtubule motors and their cargo that was previously shown to link vesicles and mRNP complexes to the dynein motor. Here, we identified a G2-specific role for BICD2 in the relative positioning of the nucleus and centrosomes in dividing cells. By combining mass spectrometry, biochemical and cell biological approaches, we show that the nuclear pore complex (NPC) component RanBP2 directly binds to BICD2 and recruits it to NPCs specifically in G2 phase of the cell cycle. BICD2, in turn, recruits dynein-dynactin to NPCs and as such is needed to keep centrosomes closely tethered to the nucleus prior to mitotic entry. When dynein function is suppressed by RNA interference-mediated depletion or antibody microinjection, centrosomes and nuclei are actively pushed apart in late G2 and we show that this is due to the action of kinesin-1. Surprisingly, depletion of BICD2 inhibits both dynein and kinesin-1-dependent movements of the nucleus and cytoplasmic NPCs, demonstrating that BICD2 is needed not only for the dynein function at the nuclear pores but also for the antagonistic activity of kinesin-1. Our study demonstrates that the nucleus is subject to opposing activities of dynein and kinesin-1 motors and that BICD2 contributes to nuclear and centrosomal positioning prior to mitotic entry through regulation of both dynein and kinesin-1.",2010,"Annette Flotho, Jeroen Demmers, Marvin E Tanenbaum, Frauke Melchior, Maarten Fornerod, Elize D Haasdijk, Ilya Grigoriev, Dieuwke Engelsma, Anna Akhmanova, Nanda Keijzer, René H Medema, Arne Lindqvist, Dick Jaarsma, Daniël Splinter, Casper C Hoogenraad, Ka Lou Yu"

Our analysis identifies Twist (Twi) as a crucial co-operating factor. Enhancers from several direct Notch targets require a combination of Twi and Notch activities for expression in vivo; neither alone is sufficient. Twi is bound at target enhancers prior to Notch activation and enhances Su(H) binding to these regulatory regions. To determine the breadth of the combinatorial regulation we mapped Twi occupancy genome-wide in DmD8 myogenic progenitor-related cells by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Comparing the sites bound by Su(H) and by Twi in these cells revealed a strong association, identifying a large spectrum of co-regulated genes. We conclude that Twi is an essential Notch co-regulator in myogenic progenitor cells and has the potential to confer specificity on Notch signalling at over 170 genes, showing that a single factor can have a profound effect on the output of the pathway.",2010,"Boris Adryan, Ben Housden, Sarah J Bray, Alena Krejci, Fred Bernard"
Hormonal regulation of Drosophila microRNA let-7 and miR-125 that target innate immunity,20798594,10.4161/fly.4.4.13008,"The steroid 20-hydroxy-ecdysone (20-HE) and the sesquiterpenoid Juvenile Hormone (JH) coordinate insect life stage transitions. 20-HE exerts these effects by the sequential induction of response genes. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans hormones also play a role in such transitions, but notably, microRNA such as let-7 and lin-4 have likewise been found to help order developmental steps. Little is known about the corresponding function of homologous microRNA in Drosophila melanogaster, and the way microRNA might be regulated by 20-HE in the fly is ambiguous. Here we used Drosophila S2 cells to analyze the effects of 20-HE on D. melanogaster microRNA let-7 and miR-125, the homolog of lin-4. The induction by 20-HE of let-7 and miR-125 in S2 cells is inhibited by RNAi knockdown of the ecdysone receptor and, as previously shown, by knockdown of its cofactor broad-complex C. To help resolve the currently ambiguous role of 20-HE in the control of microRNA, we show that nanomolar concentrations of 20-HE primes cells to subsequently express microRNA when exposed to micromolar levels of 20-HE. We then explore the role microRNA plays in the established relationship between 20-HE and the induction of innate immunity. We show that the 3'UTR of the antimicrobial peptide diptericin has a let-7 binding site and that let-7 represses translation from this site. We conclude that 20-HE facilitates the initial expression of innate immunity while it simultaneously induces negative regulation via microRNA control of antimicrobial peptide translation.",2010,"Marc Tatar, Alina Garbuzov"
Apical constriction and invagination downstream of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway require Rho1 and Myosin II,20102708,10.1016/j.ydbio.2010.01.021,"The tumor suppressor Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) is a negative regulator of Wnt signaling and functions in cytoskeletal organization. Disruption of human APC in colonic epithelia initiates benign polyps that progress to carcinoma following additional mutations. The early events of polyposis are poorly understood, as is the role of canonical Wnt signaling in normal epithelial architecture and morphogenesis. To determine the consequences of complete loss of APC in a model epithelium, we generated APC2 APC1 double null clones in the Drosophila wing imaginal disc. APC loss leads to segregation, apical constriction, and invagination that result from transcriptional activation of canonical Wnt signaling. Further, we show that Wnt-dependent changes in cell fate can be decoupled from Wnt-dependent changes in cell shape. Wnt activation is reported to upregulate DE-cadherin in wing discs, and elevated DE-cadherin is thought to promote apical constriction. We find that apical constriction and invagination of APC null tissue are independent of DE-cadherin elevation, but are dependent on Myosin II activity. Further, we show that disruption of Rho1 suppresses apical constriction and invagination in APC null cells. Our data suggest a novel link between canonical Wnt signaling and epithelial structure that requires activation of the Rho1 pathway and Myosin II.",2010,"Brooke M McCartney, Lauren M Thorpe, Vilma R Medrano, Carolyn A Mallozzi, Sandra G Zimmerman"
Regulation of mRNA translation as a conserved mechanism of longevity control,20886753,10.1007/978-1-4419-7002-2_2,"Appropriate regulation of mRNA translation is essential for growth and survival and the pathways that regulate mRNA translation have been highly conserved throughout eukaryotic evolution. Translation is controlled by a complex set of mechanisms acting at multiple levels, ranging from global protein synthesis to individual mRNAs. Recently, several mutations that perturb regulation of mRNA translation have also been found to increase longevity in three model organisms: the buddingyeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Many of these translation control factors can be mapped to a single pathway downstream of the nutrient responsive target of rapamycin (TOR) kinase. In this chapter, we will review the data suggesting that mRNA translation is an evolutionarily conserved modifier of longevity and discuss potential mechanisms by which mRNA translation could influence aging and age-associated disease in different species.",2010,"Lara S Shamieh, Ranjana Mehta, Matt Kaeberlein, Devon Chandler-Brown, Fresnida J Ramos"
Mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition of intercalating cells in Drosophila renal tubules depends on polarity cues from epithelial neighbours,20382220,10.1016/j.mod.2010.04.002,"The intercalation of mesenchymal cells into epithelia, through mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET), underlies organogenesis, for example, in nephrogenesis, and tissue regeneration, during cell renewal and wound repair. Despite its importance, surprisingly little is known about the mechanisms that bring about MET in comparison with the related and much-studied, reverse process, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). We analyse the molecular events that regulate MET as stellate cells integrate into the established epithelium of the developing renal tubules in Drosophila. We show that stellate cells polarise as they integrate between epithelial principal cells and that the normal, localised expression of cell polarity proteins in principal cells is required for stellate cells to become epithelial. While the basolateral and apical membranes act as cues for stellate cell polarity, adherens junction integrity is required to regulate their movement through the epithelium; in the absence of these junctions stellate cells continue migrating into the tubule lumen. We also show that expression of basolateral proteins in stellate cells is a prerequisite for their ingression between principal cells. We present a model in which the contacts with successive principal cell membrane domains made by stellate cells as they integrate between them act as a cue for the elaboration of stellate cell polarity. We suggest that the formation of zonula adherens junctions between new cell neighbours establishes their apico-basal positions and stabilises them in the epithelium.",2010,"Jordi Casanova, Kyra Campbell, Helen Skaer"
Dosage compensation of sex chromosome genes in eukaryotes,22649662,,"Sex chromosome evolution is accompanied by significant divergence in morphology and gene content and results in most genes of one of the sex chromosomes being present in two dosages in one sex and in one dosage in the other. To eliminate the difference in the expression levels of these genes between sexes and to restore equal expression levels of the genes between sex chromosomes and autosomes, mechanisms of dosage compensation have appeared. Studies of three classical objects,Drosophila melanogaster,Caenorhabditis elegans, and mammals, have shown that dosage compensation of X-linked genes can be achieved through completely different chromosome-wide mechanisms. New data on sex chromosome gene expression demonstrating that many sex chromosome genes can be expressed at different levels in males and females were recently obtained from birds and butterflies.

Elective affinities: a Tudor-Aubergine tale of germline partnership,20844011,10.1101/gad.1977010,"In Drosophila melanogaster and many other metazoans, the specification of germ cells requires cytoplasmic inheritance of maternally synthesized RNA and protein determinants, which are assembled in electron-dense cytoplasmic structures known as germ or polar granules, found at the posterior end of the oocytes.

Crumbs/DaPKC-dependent apical exclusion of Bazooka promotes photoreceptor polarity remodeling,20493700,10.1016/j.cub.2010.04.049,"Background: In Drosophila epithelial cells, specification and maintenance of the zonula adherens (za) is crucial to ensure epithelial tissue integrity. This depends on the intertwined function of Bazooka (Baz), Par6-DaPKC, and the Crumbs (Crb)-Stardust (Sdt)-PATJ complex. However, the detailed molecular basis for the interplay between these factors during this process is not fully understood. Results: We demonstrate that during photoreceptor apicobasal polarity remodeling, Crb is required to exclude Baz from the subapical domain. This is achieved by recruiting Par6 and DaPKC to this membrane domain. This molecular sorting depends on Baz phosphorylation by DaPKC at the conserved serine 980 and on the activity of the small GTPase Cdc42 associated with Par6. Our data indicate that although Cdc42 binding to Par6 is not required for Baz phosphorylation by DaPKC, it is required for optimum recruitment of Crb at the subapical membrane, a process necessary for delineating the nascent za from this membrane domain. Conclusion: Binding of Cdc42 to the DaPKC regulatory subunit Par6 is required to promote Crb- and DaPKC-dependent apical exclusion of Baz. This molecular sorting mechanism results in setting up the boundary between the photoreceptor subapical membrane and the za.",2010,"Franck Pichaud, Rhian F Walther"

Alternative splicing modulates Ubx protein function in Drosophila melanogaster,20038634,10.1534/genetics.109.112086,"The Drosophila Hox gene Ultrabithorax (Ubx) produces a family of protein isoforms through alternative splicing. Isoforms differ from one another by the presence of optional segments-encoded by individual exons-that modify the distance between the homeodomain and a cofactor-interaction module termed the ""YPWM"" motif. To investigate the functional implications of Ubx alternative splicing, here we analyze the in vivo effects of the individual Ubx isoforms on the activation of a natural Ubx molecular target, the decapentaplegic (dpp) gene, within the embryonic mesoderm. These experiments show that the Ubx isoforms differ in their abilities to activate dpp in mesodermal tissues during embryogenesis. Furthermore, using a Ubx mutant that reduces the full Ubx protein repertoire to just one single isoform, we obtain specific anomalies affecting the patterning of anterior abdominal muscles, demonstrating that Ubx isoforms are not functionally interchangeable during embryonic mesoderm development. Finally, a series of experiments in vitro reveals that Ubx isoforms also vary in their capacity to bind DNA in presence of the cofactor Extradenticle (Exd). Altogether, our results indicate that the structural changes produced by alternative splicing have functional implications for Ubx protein function in vivo and in vitro. Since other Hox genes also produce splicing isoforms affecting similar protein domains, we suggest that alternative splicing may represent an underestimated regulatory system modulating Hox gene specificity during fly development.",2010,"Tim Hoare, Stefan Thomsen, Hilary C Reed, Robert A H White, Michael Akam, Thomas A Weaver, Claudio R Alonso"
Replacement of mouse Sox10 by the Drosophila ortholog Sox100B provides evidence for co-option of SoxE proteins into vertebrate-specific gene-regulatory networks through altered expression,20144603,10.1016/j.ydbio.2010.01.038,"Neural crest cells and oligodendrocytes as the myelinating glia of the central nervous system exist only in vertebrates.

Here we analyzed by in ovo electroporation in chicken and by gene replacement in the mouse whether the Drosophila ortholog Sox100B can functionally substitute for vertebrate SoxE proteins. Sox100B overexpression in the chicken neural tube led to the induction of neural crest cells as previously observed for vertebrate SoxE proteins. Furthermore, many aspects of neural crest and oligodendrocyte development were surprisingly normal in mice in which the Sox10 coding information was replaced by Sox100B arguing that Sox100B integrates well into the gene-regulatory networks that drive these processes. Our results therefore provide strong evidence for a model in which SoxE proteins were co-opted to these gene-regulatory networks mainly through the acquisition of novel expression patterns. However, later developmental defects in several neural crest derived lineages in mice homozygous for the Sox100B replacement allele indicate that some degree of functional specialization and adaptation of SoxE protein properties have taken place in addition to the co-option event.",2010,"Julia Hornig, Silke Schreiner, François Cossais, Susanne Kellerer, Elisabeth Sock, Michael R Bösl, Steven Russell, Michael Wegner"

This suggests that the formation of a chromatin loop between interacting insulators is not a key factor for enhancement of insulation, which is in disagreement with the main idea of structural models.

Chromatin protein L3MBTL1 is dispensable for development and tumor suppression in mice,20592034,10.1074/jbc.M110.115410,"L3MBTL1, a paralogue of Drosophila tumor suppressor lethal(3)malignant brain tumor (l(3)mbt), binds histones in a methylation state-dependent manner and contributes to higher order chromatin structure and transcriptional repression. It is the founding member of a family of MBT domain-containing proteins that has three members in Drosophila and nine in mice and humans. Knockdown experiments in cell lines suggested that L3MBTL1 has non-redundant roles in the suppression of oncogene expression. We generated a mutant mouse strain that lacks exons 13-20 of L3mbtl1. Markedly reduced levels of a mutant mRNA with an out-of-frame fusion of exons 12 and 21 were expressed, but a mutant protein was undetectable by Western blot analysis.

The highest expression of L3MBTL1 was detected in the brain, but its disruption did not affect brain development, spontaneous movement, and motor coordination.

In contrast with its demonstrated biochemical activities, embryonic stem (ES) cells lacking L3MBTL1 displayed no abnormalities in H4 lysine 20 (H4K20) mono-, di-, or trimethylation; had normal global chromatin density as assessed by micrococcal nuclease digests; and expressed normal levels of c-myc.

Frat oncoproteins act at the crossroad of canonical and noncanonical Wnt-signaling pathways,19802005,10.1038/onc.2009.310,"Wnt-signal transduction is critical for development and tissue homeostasis in a wide range of animal species and is frequently deregulated in human cancers.

Here, we reveal a novel, Gsk3b-independent function of Frat converging on the activation of JNK and AP-1. Both these have been used as readouts for the noncanonical Frizzled/PCP pathway, which controls polarized cell movements and the establishment of tissue polarity. We find that Frat synergizes with Diversin, the mammalian homolog of the Drosophila PCP protein diego, in the activation of JNK/AP-1 signaling. Importantly, Frat mutants deficient for binding to Gsk3b retain oncogenic activity in vivo, suggesting that Wnt/beta-catenin-independent events contribute to Frat-induced malignant transformation. The observed activities of Frat are reminiscent of the dual function of Dishevelled in the Wnt/beta-catenin and Frizzled/PCP pathways and suggest that Frat may also function to bridge canonical and noncanonical Wnt pathways.",2010,"N Proost, J-P Lambooij, J Jonkers, R van Amerongen, A Berns, M C Nawijn"
Telomere capping and cellular checkpoints: clues from fruit flies,19188707,10.1159/000167824,"In most organisms, telomeres consist of repetitive G-rich sequences that are elongated by a specific reverse transcriptase, telomerase. A large number of proteins are recruited by these terminal repeats, forming specialized structures that regulate telomerase activity and protect telomeres from degradation and recombination. Drosophila lacks telomerase and telomere length is maintained by transposition of three specialized retrotransposons. In addition, unlike yeast and mammals, Drosophila telomeres are epigenetically determined, sequence-independent structures. However, several proteins required for Drosophila telomere behavior are evolutionarily conserved. These include the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs (MRN) complex and the Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM) kinase, which are required to prevent telomeric fusions. In addition, recent studies have provided evidence that Drosophila uncapped telomeres elicit a DNA damage response (DDR) just as dysfunctional yeast and human telomeres. Uncapped Drosophila telomeres also activate the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) by recruiting the SAC kinase BubR1. Telomere-induced DDR and SAC both require the wild type function of the MRN complex. In addition, while DDR is mediated by ATR kinase, SAC activation requires both the ATM and ATR activities. These results indicate that the DNA repair systems play multiple roles at Drosophila telomeres, highlighting the importance of this model organism for investigations on the relationships between DNA repair and telomere maintenance.",2008,"L Ciapponi, G Cenci"
Rudra interrupts receptor signaling complexes to negatively regulate the IMD pathway,18688280,10.1371/journal.ppat.1000120,"Insects rely primarily on innate immune responses to fight pathogens. In Drosophila, antimicrobial peptides are key contributors to host defense. Antimicrobial peptide gene expression is regulated by the IMD and Toll pathways. Bacterial peptidoglycans trigger these pathways, through recognition by peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs). DAP-type peptidoglycan triggers the IMD pathway via PGRP-LC and PGRP-LE, while lysine-type peptidoglycan is an agonist for the Toll pathway through PGRP-SA and PGRP-SD. Recent work has shown that the intensity and duration of the immune responses initiating with these receptors is tightly regulated at multiple levels, by a series of negative regulators. Through two-hybrid screening with PGRP-LC, we identified Rudra, a new regulator of the IMD pathway, and demonstrate that it is a critical feedback inhibitor of peptidoglycan receptor signaling. Following stimulation of the IMD pathway, rudra expression was rapidly induced. In cells, RNAi targeting of rudra caused a marked up-regulation of antimicrobial peptide gene expression. rudra mutant flies also hyper-activated antimicrobial peptide genes and were more resistant to infection with the insect pathogen Erwinia carotovora carotovora. Molecularly, Rudra was found to bind and interfere with both PGRP-LC and PGRP-LE, disrupting their signaling complex. These results show that Rudra is a critical component in a negative feedback loop, whereby immune-induced gene expression rapidly produces a potent inhibitor that binds and inhibits pattern recognition receptors.",2008,"Christie Vriesema-Magnuson, Deniz Ertürk-Hasdemir, Nicholas Paquette, Florentina Rus, Kamna Aggarwal, Neal Silverman"
Multiple intrinsically disordered sequences alter DNA binding by the homeodomain of the Drosophila hox protein ultrabithorax,18508761,10.1074/jbc.M800375200,"During animal development, distinct tissues, organs, and appendages are specified through differential gene transcription by Hox transcription factors. However, the conserved Hox homeodomains bind DNA with high affinity yet low specificity. We have therefore explored the structure of the Drosophila melanogaster Hox protein Ultrabithorax and the impact of its nonhomeodomain regions on DNA binding properties. Computational and experimental approaches identified several conserved, intrinsically disordered regions outside the homeodomain of Ultrabithorax that impact DNA binding by the homeodomain. Full-length Ultrabithorax bound to target DNA 2.5-fold weaker than its isolated homeodomain. Using N-terminal and C-terminal deletion mutants, we demonstrate that the YPWM region and the disordered microexons (termed the I1 region) inhibit DNA binding approximately 2-fold, whereas the disordered I2 region inhibits homeodomain-DNA interaction a further approximately 40-fold. Binding is restored almost to homeodomain affinity by the mostly disordered N-terminal 174 amino acids (R region) in a length-dependent manner. Both the I2 and R regions contain portions of the activation domain, functionally linking DNA binding and transcription regulation. Given that (i) the I1 region and a portion of the R region alter homeodomain-DNA binding as a function of pH and (ii) an internal deletion within I1 increases Ultrabithorax-DNA affinity, I1 must directly impact homeodomain-DNA interaction energetics. However, I2 appears to indirectly affect DNA binding in a manner countered by the N terminus. The amino acid sequences of I2 and much of the I1 and R regions vary significantly among Ultrabithorax orthologues, potentially diversifying Hox-DNA interactions.",2008,"Kathleen S Matthews, Sarah E Bondos, Ying Liu"
Clustering of Drosophila melanogaster immune genes in interplay with recombination rate,18665272,10.1371/journal.pone.0002835,"Background: Gene order in eukaryotic chromosomes is not random and has been linked to coordination of gene expression, chromatin structure and also recombination rate. The evolution of recombination rate is especially relevant for genes involved in immunity because host-parasite co-evolution could select for increased recombination rate (Red Queen hypothesis). To identify patterns left by the intimate interaction between hosts and parasites, I analysed the genomic parameters of the immune genes from 24 gene families/groups of Drosophila melanogaster. Principal findings: Immune genes that directly interact with the pathogen (i.e. recognition and effector genes) clustered in regions of higher recombination rates. Out of these, clustered effector genes were transcribed fastest indicating that transcriptional control might be one major cause for cluster formation. The relative position of clusters to each other, on the other hand, cannot be explained by transcriptional control per se. Drosophila immune genes that show epistatic interactions can be found at an average distance of 15.44+/-2.98 cM, which is considerably closer than genes that do not interact (30.64+/-1.95 cM). Conclusions: Epistatically interacting genes rarely belong to the same cluster, which supports recent models of optimal recombination rates between interacting genes in antagonistic host-parasite co-evolution. These patterns suggest that formation of local clusters might be a result of transcriptional control, but that in the condensed genome of D. melanogaster relative position of these clusters may be a result of selection for optimal rather than maximal recombination rates between these clusters.",2008,K Mathias Wegner

While neural development is known to require proteins that bind AU-rich elements (ARE) and affect RNA half-life, the role of specific RNA stability in this process remains elusive. In the Drosophila embryo, glial fate acquisition is triggered by glial cells missing (gcm) master gene, which is transiently expressed in all gliogenic stem cells and submitted to tight transcriptional regulation. By using in vitro and in vivo site directed mutagenesis, we have discovered that gcm RNA is unstable and that its 3'UTR confers labile properties to RNA due to the presence of an ARE motif. Moreover, we show that the gliogenic potential of Gcm transcription factor increases when ARE is abolished and demonstrate the importance of gcm RNA stability in the acquisition of the glial fate.

However, endocytosis of Egfr, the receptor for Gurken in the follicle cells, also plays a role in shaping the extracellular gradient of the Gurken morphogen. Previously, we have found that mutation in the Cbl gene caused elevated Egfr signaling along the dorsoventral axis, and resulted in dorsalization phenotypes in embryos and egg shells. Here, we report that overexpression of the Cbl long isoform significantly changed Gurken distribution. Using an HRP-Gurken fusion protein, we demonstrate that internalization of the Gurken-Egfr complex depends on the activity of Cbl. Increased levels of CblL promote the internalization of this complex, leading to the reduction of free ligands. The Gurken-Egfr complex trafficks through the Rab5/Rab7 associated endocytic pathway to the lysosomal degradation compartment for signaling termination. We observe endocytic Gurken not only in the dorsal but also in the ventral follicle cells, which is, to our knowledge, the first visualization of Gurken on the ventral side of egg chambers. Our results show that Gurken travels towards the lateral/posterior of the egg chamber in the absence of Cbl, suggesting that Cbl actively regulates Gurken distribution through promoting endocytosis and subsequent degradation.",2008,"Willisa Liou, Li-Mei Pai, Hsiao-Chung Pen, Yu-Wei Chang, Wei-How Li, Wei Chiang, He-Yen Chou, Wei-Ling Chang"

Full-length hScrib was cleaved by caspase during death ligands-induced apoptosis, which generates a p170 C-terminal fragments in Hela cells. In vitro cleavage assay using recombinant caspases showed that hScrib is cleaved by the executioner caspases. DNA damage-induced apoptosis caused loss of expression of full-length hScrib, which was recovered by addition of capase-3 inhibitor in HaCat cells. TUNEL positive apoptotic cells, which were identified 4 h after UV irradiation in HaCat cells, showed loss of hScrib expression at the adherens junction. Mutational analysis identified the caspase-dependent cleavage site of hScrib at the position of Asp-504. Although MDCK cells transfected with GFP-fused wild-type hScrib showed loss of E-cadherin expression and shrinkage of cytoplasm by UV irradiation, cells transfected with hScrib with Ala substitution of Asp-504 showed resistance to caspase-dependent cleavage of hScrib and intact expression of E-cadherin. These results indicate that caspase-dependent cleavage of hScrib is a critical step for detachment of cell contact during the process of apoptosis.",2008,"Tetsushi Tsuruga, Osamu Hiraike-Wada, Keiichi Nakagawa, Katsutoshi Oda, Toshiharu Yasugi, Koji Kugu, Kenbun Sone, Haruko Hiraike, Yoko Matsumoto, Tetsu Yano, Yuichiro Miyamoto, Yuji Taketani, Shunsuke Nakagawa, Kazunori Nagasaka, Shin Takizawa"
Neurite arborization and mosaic spacing in the mouse retina require DSCAM,18216855,10.1038/nature06514,"To establish functional circuitry, retinal neurons occupy spatial domains by arborizing their processes, which requires the self-avoidance of neurites from an individual cell, and by spacing their cell bodies, which requires positioning the soma and establishing a zone within which other cells of the same type are excluded. The mosaic patterns of distinct cell types form independently and overlap. The cues that direct these processes in the vertebrate retina are not known. Here we show that some types of retinal amacrine cells from mice with a spontaneous mutation in Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule (Dscam), a gene encoding an immunoglobulin-superfamily member adhesion molecule, have defects in the arborization of processes and in the spacing of cell bodies. In the mutant retina, cells that would normally express Dscam have hyperfasciculated processes, preventing them from creating an orderly arbor. Also, their cell bodies are randomly distributed or pulled into clumps rather than being regularly spaced mosaics. Our results indicate that mouse DSCAM mediates isoneuronal self-avoidance for arborization and heteroneuronal self-avoidance within specific cell types to prevent fasciculation and to preserve mosaic spacing. These functions are analogous to those of Drosophila DSCAM (ref. 6) and DSCAM2 (ref. 7). DSCAM may function similarly in other regions of the mammalian nervous system, and this role may extend to other members of the mammalian Dscam gene family.",2008,"Amane Koizumi, Peter G Fuerst, Richard H Masland, Robert W Burgess"
Selection for resistance to a fungal pathogen in Drosophila melanogaster,18301441,10.1038/sj.hdy.6801092,"An artificial selection experiment designed to explore the evolution of resistance to a fungal pathogen, Beauveria bassiana, in Drosophila melanogaster is reported here. The experiment was designed to test whether there is sufficient additive genetic variation in this trait for increased resistance to evolve, and, if so, whether there are correlated responses that might represent a cost to defence. After 15 generations of selection, flies from selected lines did not have higher overall fitness after infection compared with control lines. The response to selection for resistance against this pathogen is thus much weaker than against other species, in particular, parasitoids. There was, however, evidence for increased late-life fecundity in selected lines, which may indicate evolved tolerance of fungal infection. This increase was accompanied by reduced early-life fitness, which may reflect the well-known trade-off between early and late reproduction. In the absence of fungal infection, selected flies had lower fitness than control flies, and the possibility that this is also a trade-off with increased tolerance is explored.",2008,"A R Kraaijeveld, H C J Godfray"
Clonal analysis of Drosophila antennal lobe neurons: diverse neuronal architectures in the lateral neuroblast lineage,18653555,10.1242/dev.024380,"The antennal lobe (AL) is the primary structure in the Drosophila brain that relays odor information from the antennae to higher brain centers. The characterization of uniglomerular projection neurons (PNs) and some local interneurons has facilitated our understanding of olfaction; however, many other AL neurons remain unidentified. Because neuron types are mostly specified by lineage and temporal origins, we use the MARCM techniques with a set of enhancer-trap GAL4 lines to perform systematical lineage analysis to characterize neuron morphologies, lineage origin and birth timing in the three AL neuron lineages that contain GAL4-GH146-positive PNs: anterodorsal, lateral and ventral lineages. The results show that the anterodorsal lineage is composed of pure uniglomerular PNs that project through the inner antennocerebral tract. The ventral lineage produces uniglomerular and multiglomerular PNs that project through the middle antennocerebral tract. The lateral lineage generates multiple types of neurons, including uniglomeurlar PNs, diverse atypical PNs, various types of AL local interneurons and the neurons that make no connection within the ALs. Specific neuron types in all three lineages are produced in specific time windows, although multiple neuron types in the lateral lineage are made simultaneously. These systematic cell lineage analyses have not only filled gaps in the olfactory map, but have also exemplified additional strategies used in the brain to increase neuronal diversity.",2008,"Tzumin Lee, Sen-Lin Lai, Kei Ito, Takeshi Awasaki"
The transmembrane protein Golden goal regulates R8 photoreceptor axon-axon and axon-target interactions,18341990,10.1016/j.neuron.2008.01.012,"During Drosophila visual system development, photoreceptor (R) axons choose their correct paths and targets in a step-wise fashion. R axons with different identities make specific pathfinding decisions at different stages during development. We show here that the transmembrane protein Golden goal (Gogo), which is dynamically expressed in all R neurons and localizes predominantly to growth cones, is required in two distinct steps of R8 photoreceptor axon pathfinding: Gogo regulates axon-axon interactions and axon-target interactions in R8 photoreceptor axons. gogo loss-of-function and gain-of-function phenotypes suggest that Gogo mediates repulsive axon-axon interaction between R8 axons to maintain their proper spacing, and it promotes axon-target recognition at the temporary layer to enable R8 axons to enter their correct target columns in the medulla. From detailed structure-function experiments, we propose that Gogo functions as a receptor that binds an unidentified ligand through its conserved extracellular domain.",2008,"Alexander Schleiffer, Satoko Hakeda-Suzuki, Stephan Ohler, Tatiana Tomasi, Takashi Suzuki"
Sex-specific control and tuning of the pattern generator for courtship song in Drosophila,18423205,10.1016/j.cell.2008.01.050,"The differentially spliced transcription factors encoded by the fruitless (fru) gene are key determinants of sexual behavior in Drosophila. They are expressed in a minority of neurons with limited dimorphisms and regulate neural processes that remain largely unknown. Here, we use light-activated ion channels to stimulate fru-expressing neurons in the thoracic-abdominal ganglia, enabling direct functional comparisons of homologous circuitry between sexes. Optical stimulation of males or females initiates the unilateral wing vibrations that normally generate the male courtship song. The pattern-generating circuit operates differently in the two sexes, producing wing movement and sound in both but authentic songs only in males and in females expressing male fru product. A song-like motor program is thus present in females but lies dormant because the neural commands required for song initiation are absent. Supplying such commands artificially reveals fru-specific differences in the internal dynamics of the song generator and sets the stage for exploring their physiological basis.",2008,"J Dylan Clyne, Gero Miesenböck"
A sterile sperm caste protects brother fertile sperm from female-mediated death in Drosophila pseudoobscura,18291649,10.1016/j.cub.2008.01.048,"Spermicide (i.e., female-mediated sperm death) is an understudied but potentially widespread phenomenon that has important ramifications for the study of sexual conflict, postcopulatory sexual selection, and fertility [1, 2]. Males are predicted to evolve adaptations against spermicide, but few antispermicidal mechanisms have been definitively identified. One such adaptation may be the enigmatic infertile sperm morphs or ""parasperm"" produced by many species, which have been hypothesized to protect their fertile brother ""eusperm"" from spermicide [2, 3]. Here, we show that female Drosophila pseudoobscura reproductive tracts are spermicidal and that the survival of eusperm after exposure to the female tract is highest when males produce many parasperm. This study clarifies the adaptive significance of infertile sperm castes, which has remained elusive in Drosophila and other taxa despite much recent interest [2-8]. We suggest that spermicide and male countermeasures against it are more common than is appreciated currently and discuss how spermicide could drive the evolution of several key male traits, including sperm size and number.",2008,"Luke Holman, Rhonda R Snook"

Altered ivermectin pharmacology and defective visual system in Drosophila mutants for histamine receptor HCLB,18839229,10.1007/s10158-008-0078-2,"The Drosophila gene hclB encodes a histamine-gated chloride channel, which can be activated by the neurotoxin ivermectin when expressed in vitro. We have identified two novel hclB mutants, carrying either a missense mutation (P293S, allele hclB (T1)) or a putative null mutation (W111*, allele hclB (T2)), as well as a novel splice form of the gene. In survival studies, hclB (T1) mutants were more sensitive to ivermectin than wild-type, whereas hclB (T2) were more resistant. Electroretinogram recordings from the two mutants exhibited enlarged peak amplitudes of the transient components, indicating altered synaptic transmission between retinal photoneurons and their target cells. Ivermectin treatment severely affected or completely suppressed these transient components in an allele-specific manner. This suppression of synaptic signals by ivermectin was dose-dependent. These results identify HCLB as an important in vivo target for ivermectin in Drosophila melanogaster, and demonstrate the involvement of this protein in the visual pathway.",2008,"Shazie Yusein, Petia Kupenova, Eugene Semenov, Roger Hardie, Adrian Wolstenholme, Nadya Velikova"
The Gr family of candidate gustatory and olfactory receptors in the yellow-fever mosquito Aedes aegypti,17928357,10.1093/chemse/bjm067,"The gustatory receptor (Gr) protein family contains most of the diversity in the insect chemoreceptor superfamily, including within it not only taste receptors but select olfactory receptors as well.

In the sequenced genome, 23 of these genes and protein isoforms are pseudogenic, leaving 91 putatively functional Grs. Comparison with our previously published set of 76 Grs encoded by 52 genes in the distantly related Anopheles gambiae mosquito revealed 13 new AgGrs encoded by 8 genes. Phylogenetic analysis reveals the conservation of carbon dioxide, sugar, and several orphan receptors in these 2 mosquitoes and Drosophila flies. On the other hand, most of these Grs are unique to mosquitoes and many are specific to the Aedes or Anopheles lineages, indicating their involvement in mosquito-specific aspects of both gustatory and olfactory perception.

Drosophila STAT is required for directly maintaining HP1 localization and heterochromatin stability,18344984,10.1038/ncb1713,"STAT (Signal transducer and activator of transcription) is a potent transcription factor and its aberrant activation by phosphorylation is associated with human cancers. We have shown previously that overactivation of JAK, which phosphorylates STAT, disrupts heterochromatin formation globally in Drosophila melanogaster. However, it remains unclear how this effect is mediated and whether STAT is involved. Here, we demonstrate that Drosophila STAT (STAT92E) is involved in controlling heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) distribution and heterochromatin stability. We found, unexpectedly, that loss of STAT92E, had the same effects as overactivation of JAK in disrupting heterochromatin formation and heterochromatic gene silencing, whereas overexpression of STAT92E had the opposite effects. We have further shown that the unphosphorylated or 'transcriptionally inactive' form of STAT92E is localized on heterochromatin in association with HP1, and is required for stabilizing HP1 localization and histone H3 Lys 9 methylation (H3mK9) . However, activation by phosphorylation reduces heterochromatin-associated STAT92E, causing HP1 displacement and heterochromatin destabilization. Thus, reducing levels of unphosphorylated STAT92E, either by loss of STAT92E or increased phosphorylation, causes heterochromatin instability. These results suggest that activation of STAT by phosphorylation controls both access to chromatin and activity of the transcription machinery.",2008,"Pranabananda Dutta, Willis X Li, Dongdong Guo, Shian-Jang Yan, Song Shi, Su Jun Lim, Kimberly Larson"
Anatomy of the stomatogastric nervous system associated with the foregut in Drosophila melanogaster and Calliphora vicina third instar larvae,17960761,10.1002/jmor.10581,"The stomatogastric nervous system (SNS) associated with the foregut was studied in 3rd instar larvae of Drosophila melanogaster and Calliphora vicina (blowfly). In both species, the foregut comprises pharynx, esophagus, and proventriculus. Only in Calliphora does the esophagus form a crop. The position of nerves and neurons was investigated with neuronal tracers in both species and GFP expression in Drosophila. The SNS is nearly identical in both species. Neurons are located in the proventricular and the hypocerebral ganglion (HCG), which are connected to each other by the proventricular nerve. Motor neurons for pharyngeal muscles are located in the brain not, as in other insect groups, in the frontal ganglion. The position of the frontal ganglion is taken by a nerve junction devoid of neurons. The junction is composed of four nerves: the frontal connectives that fuse with the antennal nerves (ANs), the frontal nerve innervating the cibarial dilator muscles and the recurrent nerve that innervates the esophagus and projects to the HCG. Differences in the SNS are restricted to a crop nerve only present in Calliphora and an esophageal ganglion that only exists in Drosophila. The ganglia of the dorsal organs give rise to the ANs, which project to the brain. The extensive conformity of the SNS of both species suggests functional parallels. Future electrophysiological studies of the motor circuits in the SNS of Drosophila will profit from parallel studies of the homologous but more accessible structures in Calliphora.",2008,"Hans-Georg Heinzel, Roland Spiess, Andreas Schoofs"
MAP1 structural organization in Drosophila: in vivo analysis of FUTSCH reveals heavy- and light-chain subunits generated by proteolytic processing at a conserved cleavage site,18419581,10.1042/BJ20071449,"The MAP1 (microtubule-associated protein 1) family is a class of microtubule-binding proteins represented by mammalian MAP1A, MAP1B and the recently identified MAP1S. MAP1A and MAP1B are expressed in the nervous system and thought to mediate interactions of the microtubule-based cytoskeleton in neural development and function. The characteristic structural organization of mammalian MAP1s, which are composed of heavy- and light-chain subunits, requires proteolytic cleavage of a precursor polypeptide encoded by the corresponding map1 gene. MAP1 function in Drosophila appears to be fulfilled by a single gene, futsch. Although the futsch gene product is known to share several important functional properties with mammalian MAP1s, whether it adopts the same basic structural organization has not been addressed. Here, we report the identification of a Drosophila MAP1 light chain, LC(f), produced by proteolytic cleavage of a futsch-encoded precursor polypeptide, and confirm co-localization and co-assembly of the heavy chain and LC(f) cleavage products. Furthermore, the in vivo properties of MAP1 proteins were further defined through precise MS identification of a conserved proteolytic cleavage site within the futsch-encoded MAP1 precursor and demonstration of light-chain diversity represented by multiple LC(f) variants. Taken together, these findings establish conservation of proteolytic processing and structural organization among mammalian and Drosophila MAP1 proteins and are expected to enhance genetic analysis of conserved MAP1 functions within the neuronal cytoskeleton.",2008,"Beiyan Zou, Richard W Ordway, Fumiko Kawasaki, Huaru Yan"
The dynamics of fluorescently labeled endogenous gurken mRNA in Drosophila,18303053,10.1242/jcs.019091,"During Drosophila oogenesis, the targeted localization of gurken (grk) mRNA leads to the establishment of the axis polarity of the egg. In early stages of oogenesis, grk mRNA is found at the posterior of the oocyte, whereas in the later stages grk mRNA is positioned at the dorsal anterior corner of the oocyte. In order to visualize the real-time localization and anchorage of endogenous grk mRNA in living oocytes, we have utilized the MS2-MCP system. We show that MCP-GFP-tagged endogenous grk mRNA localizes properly within wild-type oocytes and behaves aberrantly in mutant backgrounds. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments of localized grk mRNA in egg chambers reveal a difference in the dynamics of grk mRNA between young and older egg chambers. grk mRNA particles, as a population, are highly dynamic molecules that steadily lose their dynamic nature as oogenesis progresses. This difference in dynamics is attenuated in K10 and sqd(1) mutants such that mislocalized grk mRNA in older stages is much more dynamic compared with that in wild-type controls. By contrast, in flies with compromised dynein activity, properly localized grk mRNA is much more static. Taken together, we have observed the nature of localized grk mRNA in live oocytes and propose that its maintenance changes from a dynamic to a static process as oogenesis progresses.",2008,"Angela M Jaramillo, Timothy T Weil, Elizabeth R Gavis, Joseph Goodhouse, Trudi Schupbach"
Drosophila are protected from Pseudomonas aeruginosa lethality by transgenic expression of paraoxonase-1,18704198,10.1172/JCI35147,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa uses quorum sensing, an interbacterial communication system, to regulate gene expression. The signaling molecule N-3-oxododecanoyl homoserine lactone (3OC12-HSL) is thought to play a central role in quorum sensing. Since 3OC12-HSL can be degraded by paraoxonase (PON) family members, we hypothesized that PONs regulate P. aeruginosa virulence in vivo. We chose Drosophila melanogaster as our model organism because it has been shown to be a tractable model for investigating host-pathogen interactions and lacks PONs. By using quorum-sensing-deficient P. aeruginosa, synthetic acyl-HSLs, and transgenic expression of human PON1, we investigated the role of 3OC12-HSL and PON1 on P. aeruginosa virulence. We found that P. aeruginosa virulence in flies was dependent upon 3OC12-HSL. PON1 transgenic flies expressed enzymatically active PON1 and thereby exhibited arylesterase activity and resistance to organophosphate toxicity. Moreover, PON1 flies were protected from P. aeruginosa lethality, and protection was dependent on the lactonase activity of PON1. Our findings show that PON1 can interfere with quorum sensing in vivo and provide insight into what we believe is a novel role for PON1 in the innate immune response to quorum-sensing-dependent pathogens. These results raise intriguing possibilities about human-pathogen interactions, including potential roles for PON1 as a modifier gene and for PON1 protein as a regulator of normal bacterial florae, a link between infection/inflammation and cardiovascular disease, and a potential therapeutic modality.",2008,"Peter J Taft, Peter J Kiss, David A Stoltz, Thomas O Moninger, Matthew R Parsek, Marilyn Barry, Egon A Ozer, Joseph Zabner, Lei Liu"

"Effects of hyperkinetic, a beta subunit of Shaker voltage-dependent K+ channels, on the oxidation state of presynaptic nerve terminals",18428031,10.1080/01677060701807954,"The Drosophila Hyperkinetic (Hk) gene encodes a beta subunit of Shaker (Sh) K+ channels and shows high sequence homology to aldoketoreductase. Hk mutations are known to modify the voltage dependence and kinetics of Sh currents, which are also influenced by the oxidative state of the N-terminus region of the Sh channel, as demonstrated in heterologous expression experiments in frog oocytes. However, an in vivo role of Hk in cellular reduction/oxidation (redox) has not been demonstrated. By using a fluorescent indicator of reactive oxygen species (ROS), dihydrorhodamine-123 (DHR), we show that the presynaptic nerve terminal of larval motor axons is metabolically active, with more rapid accumulation of ROS in comparison with muscle cells. In Hk terminals, DHR fluorescence was greatly enhanced, indicating increased ROS levels. This observation implicates a role of the Hk beta subunit in redox regulation in presynaptic terminals. This phenomenon was paralleled by the expected effects of the mutations affecting glutathione S-transferase S1 as well as applying H2O2 to wild-type synaptic terminals. Thus, our results also establish DHR as a useful tool for detecting ROS levels in the Drosophila neuromuscular junction.",2008,"Chun-Fang Wu, Atsushi Ueda"
Protein kinase A inhibits a consolidated form of memory in Drosophila,19075226,10.1073/pnas.0810119105,"Increasing activity of the cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) pathway has often been proposed as an approach to improve memory in various organisms.

These mutations do not affect formation of early memory phases or of protein synthesis-dependent long-term memory but do cause a significant increase in a specific consolidated form of memory, anesthesia-resistant memory. Significantly, heterozygotes of null mutations in PKA are sufficient to cause this memory increase. Expressing a PKA transgene in the mushroom bodies, brain structures critical for memory formation in Drosophila, reduces memory back to wild-type levels. These results indicate that although PKA is critical for formation of several memory phases, it also functions to inhibit at least one memory phase.",2008,"Shintaro Naganos, Daisuke Yamazaki, Minoru Saitoe, Toshiro Aigaki, Junjiro Horiuchi"
Fish specific duplication of Dmrt2: characterization of zebrafish Dmrt2b,18358846,10.1016/j.biochi.2008.02.021,"The protein families with a conserved zinc finger-like DNA binding DM domain are putative transcription factors related to the sexual regulator Dsx of Drosophila and Mab-3 of Caenorhabditis elegans. Although several members have been cloned, there are still other members need to be identified, and origin and evolution of the gene family also remain unclear. We report here cloning, expression and synteny analysis of a duplicated copy of zebrafish Dmrt2a gene, the Dmrt2b which is fish specific, whereas Dmrt2a exists in all vertebrates. During embryogenesis, the Dmrt2b expression increased gradually from shield stage to hatching stage, and mainly localized in branchial arches from 24 hpf to 40 hpf, indicating that it has a potential role in the development of branchial arches. The duplicated Dmrt2b and Dmrt2a with structural variation and expression diversification during development revealed that a process of functional diploidization of gene function occurred during zebrafish lineage. DNA binding experiment indicated that Dmrt2b recognized similar DNA sequences to those of both DSX and MAB-3, indicating a conserved regulatory function. Synteny analysis among chromosomes containing Dmrt2a and Dmrt2b showed that zebrafish Dmrt2b and at least nine genes on chromosome 6 have respective homologues on chromosome 5 containing Dmrt2a. Further synteny search from genome information showed that Dmrt2b and its neighborhood existed only in the genome of teleosts. Dmrt2a and Dmrt2b were duplicated from the duplication event, which might be part of the third genome duplication, occurred during the evolution of ray-finned fishes, probably before the emergence of osteichthyes around 350 Myr.

Functional characterization of the dRYBP gene in Drosophila,18562658,10.1534/genetics.107.082966,"The Drosophila dRYBP gene has been described to function as a Polycomb-dependent transcriptional repressor. To determine the in vivo function of the dRYBP gene, we have generated mutations and analyzed the associated phenotypes.

Although dRYBP mutations do not show the homeotic-like phenotypes typical of mutations in the PcG and trxG genes, they enhance the phenotypes of mutations of either the Sex comb extra gene (PcG) or the trithorax gene (trxG). Finally, the dRYBP protein interacts physically with the Sex comb extra and the Pleiohomeotic proteins, and the homeotic-like phenotypes produced by the high levels of the dRYBP protein are mediated through its C-terminal domain.

Recurrent deletion and gene presence/absence polymorphism: telomere dynamics dominate evolution at the tip of 3L in Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans,18505885,10.1534/genetics.107.078345,"Although Drosophila melanogaster has been the subject of intensive analysis of polymorphism and divergence, little is known about the distribution of variation at the most distal regions of chromosomes arms. Here we report a survey of genetic variation on the tip of 3L in D. melanogaster and D. simulans. Levels of single nucleotide polymorphism in the most distal euchromatic sequence are approximately one order of magnitude less than that typically observed in genomic regions of normal crossing over, consistent with what might be expected under models of linked selection in regions of low crossing over. However, despite this reduced level of nucleotide variation, we found abundant deletion polymorphism. These deletions create at least three gene presence/absence polymorphisms within D. melanogaster: the putative G-protein coupled receptor mthl-8 (which is the most distal known or predicted gene on 3L) and the unannotated mRNAs AY060886 and BT006009. Strikingly, D. simulans is also segregating deletions that cause mthl8 presence/absence polymorphism. Breakpoint sequencing and tests of correlations with segregating SNPs in D. melanogaster suggest that each deletion is unique. Cloned breakpoint sequences revealed the presence of Het-A elements just distal to unique, canonical euchromatic sequences. This pattern suggests a model in which repeated telomeric deficiencies cause deletions of euchromatic sequence followed by subsequent ""healing"" by retrotranposition of Het-A elements.

FAM29A promotes microtubule amplification via recruitment of the NEDD1-gamma-tubulin complex to the mitotic spindle,19029337,10.1083/jcb.200807046,"Microtubules (MTs) are nucleated from centrosomes and chromatin. In addition, MTs can be generated from preexiting MTs in a gamma-tubulin-dependent manner in yeast, plant, and Drosophila cells, although the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Here we show the spindle-associated protein FAM29A promotes MT-dependent MT amplification and is required for efficient chromosome congression and segregation in mammalian cells. Depletion of FAM29A reduces spindle MT density. FAM29A is not involved in the nucleation of MTs from centrosomes and chromatin, but is required for a subsequent increase in MT mass in cells released from nocodazole. FAM29A interacts with the NEDD1-gamma-tubulin complex and recruits this complex to the spindle, which, in turn, promotes MT polymerization. FAM29A preferentially associates with kinetochore MTs and knockdown of FAM29A reduces the number of MTs in a kinetochore fiber, activates the spindle checkpoint, and delays the mitotic progression.

Sequence analysis shows that DmMyo20 contains a unique N-terminal extension, the motor domain, followed by one IQ motif, and a C-terminal tail. To investigate the biochemical properties of DmMyo20, we expressed several DmMyo20 truncated constructs containing the motor domain in the baculovirus/Sf9 system. We found that the motor domain of DmMyo20 had neither ATPase activity nor the ability to bind to ATP, suggesting that DmMyo20 does not function as a molecular motor. We found that the motor domain of DmMyo20 could specifically bind to actin filaments in an ATP-independent manner and enhance the interaction between actin filaments and Zyx102, a downstream component of DmMyo20 in the Fat signaling pathway.

RNA clamping by Vasa assembles a piRNA amplifier complex on transposon transcripts,24910301,10.1016/j.cell.2014.05.018,"Germline-specific Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) protect animal genomes against transposons and are essential for fertility. piRNAs targeting active transposons are amplified by the ping-pong cycle, which couples Piwi endonucleolytic slicing of target RNAs to biogenesis of new piRNAs. Here, we describe the identification of a transient Amplifier complex that mediates biogenesis of secondary piRNAs in insect cells. Amplifier is nucleated by the DEAD box RNA helicase Vasa and contains the two Piwi proteins participating in the ping-pong loop, the Tudor protein Qin/Kumo and antisense piRNA guides. These components assemble on the surface of Vasa's helicase domain, which functions as an RNA clamp to anchor Amplifier onto transposon transcripts. We show that ATP-dependent RNP remodeling by Vasa facilitates transfer of 5' sliced piRNA precursors between ping-pong partners, and loss of this activity causes sterility in Drosophila.

Nonenzymatic domains of Kalirin7 contribute to spine morphogenesis through interactions with phosphoinositides and Abl,24600045,10.1091/mbc.E13-04-0215,"Like several Rho GDP/GTP exchange factors (GEFs), Kalirin7 (Kal7) contains an N-terminal Sec14 domain and multiple spectrin repeats. A natural splice variant of Kalrn lacking the Sec14 domain and four spectrin repeats is unable to increase spine formation; our goal was to understand the function of the Sec14 and spectrin repeat domains. Kal7 lacking its Sec14 domain still increased spine formation, but the spines were short. Strikingly, Kal7 truncation mutants containing only the Sec14 domain and several spectrin repeats increased spine formation. The Sec14 domain bound phosphoinositides, a minor but crucial component of cellular membranes, and binding was increased by a phosphomimetic mutation. Expression of KalSec14-GFP in nonneuronal cells impaired receptor-mediated endocytosis, linking Kal7 to membrane trafficking. Consistent with genetic studies placing Abl, a non-receptor tyrosine kinase, and the Drosophila orthologue of Kalrn into the same signaling pathway, Abl1 phosphorylated two sites in the fourth spectrin repeat of Kalirin, increasing its sensitivity to calpain-mediated degradation. Treating cortical neurons of the wild-type mouse, but not the Kal7(KO) mouse, with an Abl inhibitor caused an increase in linear spine density. Phosphorylation of multiple sites in the N-terminal Sec14/spectrin region of Kal7 may allow coordination of the many signaling pathways contributing to spine morphogenesis.",2014,"Richard E Mains, Megan B Miller, Tukiet T Lam, Yanping Wang, Maegan J Gross, Xin-Ming Ma, Thomas Abbott, K S Vishwanatha, Betty A Eipper"
Wisdom from the fly,25161083,10.1016/j.tig.2014.08.003,"Arguably, almost all research in Drosophila can be considered basic research, yet many of the most essential and fundamental concepts of human genetics were first decoded in the fly. Although the fly genome, which is organized into only four chromosomes, is approximately one-twentieth the size of the human genome, it contains roughly the same number of genes, and up to 75% of human disease-related genes have Drosophila homologues [1]. The fly was prized for its simplicity and utility even before such compelling homology with humans was apparent. Since Thomas Hunt Morgan began his seminal experiments over a century ago (Table 1), the Drosophila system has revealed countless key mechanisms by which cells function, including the factors that maintain chromatin and the signaling pathways that control cell fate determination and organism development. More recently, the fly has emerged as a critical neurobiological tool and disease model for a range of genetic disorders. In this review, we present a brief retrospective of Drosophila as an indispensable genetic system and discuss some of the many contributions, past and present, of this facile system to human genetics.",2014,"Erica N Larschan, Leila E Rieder"
An improved monomeric infrared fluorescent protein for neuronal and tumour brain imaging,24832154,10.1038/ncomms4626,"Infrared fluorescent proteins (IFPs) are ideal for in vivo imaging, and monomeric versions of these proteins can be advantageous as protein tags or for sensor development. In contrast to GFP, which requires only molecular oxygen for chromophore maturation, phytochrome-derived IFPs incorporate biliverdin (BV) as the chromophore. However, BV varies in concentration in different cells and organisms. Here we engineered cells to express the haeme oxygenase responsible for BV biosynthesis and a brighter monomeric IFP mutant (IFP2.0). Together, these tools improve the imaging capabilities of IFP2.0 compared with monomeric IFP1.4 and dimeric iRFP.

Distinct roles for hu li tai shao and swallow in cytoskeletal organization during Drosophila oogenesis,24677508,10.1002/dvdy.24132,"Background: Cytoskeletal organization is essential for localization of developmentally significant molecules during Drosophila oogenesis. Swallow (Swa) and an isoform of Hu li tai shao (Ovhts-RC) have been implicated in the organization of actin filaments in developing oocytes but their precise roles have been obscured by the dependence of hts RNA localization on swa function. The functional significance of hts RNA localization in the oocyte has not been established. Results: In this study we examine Ovhts-RC distribution and cytoskeletal organization under conditions in which Swa protein and/or hts RNA localization are perturbed. We find Swa is required for overall actin organization and for the maintenance of a distinct subset of microtubules in the oocyte. hts RNA localization modulates the distribution of Ovhts-RC in the oocyte and, in turn, local actin filament proliferation. Conclusions: Our results support separate contributions of Swa and hts RNA localization to actin organization during oogenesis. Swa is crucial for the organization of actin networks that lead to the formation of a specialized microtubule population, while Ovhts-RC acts to modulate spatially restricted actin filament growth at the oocyte cortex. This suggests RNA localization can lead to modifications of both the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons at specific subcellular locales.",2014,"Nancy Jo Pokrywka, Huadi Zhang, Kathleen Raley-Susman"
A spike-timing mechanism for action selection,24908103,10.1038/nn.3741,"We discovered a bimodal behavior in the genetically tractable organism Drosophila melanogaster that allowed us to directly probe the neural mechanisms of an action selection process. When confronted by a predator-mimicking looming stimulus, a fly responds with either a long-duration escape behavior sequence that initiates stable flight or a distinct, short-duration sequence that sacrifices flight stability for speed. Intracellular recording of the descending giant fiber (GF) interneuron during head-fixed escape revealed that GF spike timing relative to parallel circuits for escape actions determined which of the two behavioral responses was elicited. The process was well described by a simple model in which the GF circuit has a higher activation threshold than the parallel circuits, but can override ongoing behavior to force a short takeoff. Our findings suggest a neural mechanism for action selection in which relative activation timing of parallel circuits creates the appropriate motor output.",2014,"Catherine R von Reyn, Anthony Leonardo, Gwyneth M Card, W Ryan Williamson, Patrick Breads, Alyson L Yee, Martin Y Peek, Grace Zhiyu Zheng"
Sara endosomes and the asymmetric division of intestinal stem cells,24803650,10.1242/dev.104240,"Tissue homeostasis is maintained by adult stem cells, which self-renew and give rise to differentiating cells.

In the adult Drosophila midgut, the intestinal stem cell (ISC) divides to generate a new ISC and an enteroblast (EB) differentiating daughter. Notch signalling activity restricted to the EB regulates intestinal cell fate decision. Here, we show that ISCs divide asymmetrically, and Sara endosomes in ISCs are specifically dispatched to the presumptive EB. During ISC mitosis, Notch and Delta traffic through Sara endosomes, thereby contributing to Notch signalling bias, as revealed in Sara mutants: Sara itself contributes to the control of the ISC asymmetric division.

Genome-wide association analysis of radiation resistance in Drosophila melanogaster,25121966,10.1371/journal.pone.0104858,"Background: Ionizing radiation is genotoxic to cells. Healthy tissue toxicity in patients and radiation resistance in tumors present common clinical challenges in delivering effective radiation therapies. Radiation response is a complex, polygenic trait with unknown genetic determinants. The Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) provides a model to investigate the genetics of natural variation for sensitivity to radiation. Methods and findings: Radiation response was quantified in 154 inbred DGRP lines, among which 92 radiosensitive lines and 62 radioresistant lines were classified as controls and cases, respectively. A case-control genome-wide association screen for radioresistance was performed. There are 32 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with radio resistance at a nominal p<10(-5); all had modest effect sizes and were common variants with the minor allele frequency >5%. All the genes implicated by those SNP hits were novel, many without a known role in radiation resistance and some with unknown function. Variants in known DNA damage and repair genes associated with radiation response were below the significance threshold of p<10(-5) and were not present among the significant hits. No SNP met the genome-wide significance threshold (p = 1.49 × 10(-7)), indicating a necessity for a larger sample size. Conclusions: Several genes not previously associated with variation in radiation resistance were identified. These genes, especially the ones with human homologs, form the basis for exploring new pathways involved in radiation resistance in novel functional studies. An improved DGRP model with a sample size of at least 265 lines and ideally up to 793 lines is recommended for future studies of complex traits.",2014,"Alexander Pertsemlidis, John M Abrams, Mahesh Vaisnav, Hung-Chih Ku, Chao Xing, Strahinja Stojadinovic, Daniel Hwang"

Similarities and differences in altitudinal versus latitudinal variation for morphological traits in Drosophila melanogaster,24410363,10.1111/evo.12351,"Understanding how natural environments shape phenotypic variation is a major aim in evolutionary biology. Here, we have examined clinal, likely genetically based variation in morphology among 19 populations of the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) from Africa and Europe, spanning a range from sea level to 3000 m altitude and including locations approximating the southern and northern range limit. We were interested in testing whether latitude and altitude have similar phenotypic effects, as has often been postulated. Both latitude and altitude were positively correlated with wing area, ovariole number, and cell number. In contrast, latitude and altitude had opposite effects on the ratio between ovariole number and body size, which was negatively correlated with egg production rate per ovariole. We also used transgenic manipulation to examine how increased cell number affects morphology and found that larger transgenic flies, due to a higher number of cells, had more ovarioles, larger wings, and, unlike flies from natural populations, increased wing loading. Clinal patterns in morphology are thus not a simple function of changes in body size; instead, each trait might be subject to different selection pressures. Together, our results provide compelling evidence for profound similarities as well as differences between phenotypic effects of latitude and altitude.",2014,"Thomas Flatt, Peter Klepsatel, Martina Gáliková, Christian D Huber"

Evolution in an ancient detoxification pathway is coupled with a transition to herbivory in the drosophilidae,24974374,10.1093/molbev/msu201,"Chemically defended plant tissues present formidable barriers to herbivores. Although mechanisms to resist plant defenses have been identified in ancient herbivorous lineages, adaptations to overcome plant defenses during transitions to herbivory remain relatively unexplored. The fly genus Scaptomyza is nested within the genus Drosophila and includes species that feed on the living tissue of mustard plants (Brassicaceae), yet this lineage is derived from microbe-feeding ancestors. We found that mustard-feeding Scaptomyza species and microbe-feeding Drosophila melanogaster detoxify mustard oils, the primary chemical defenses in the Brassicaceae, using the widely conserved mercapturic acid pathway. This detoxification strategy differs from other specialist herbivores of mustard plants, which possess derived mechanisms to obviate mustard oil formation. To investigate whether mustard feeding is coupled with evolution in the mercapturic acid pathway, we profiled functional and molecular evolutionary changes in the enzyme glutathione S-transferase D1 (GSTD1), which catalyzes the first step of the mercapturic acid pathway and is induced by mustard defense products in Scaptomyza. GSTD1 acquired elevated activity against mustard oils in one mustard-feeding Scaptomyza species in which GstD1 was duplicated. Structural analysis and mutagenesis revealed that substitutions at conserved residues within and near the substrate-binding cleft account for most of this increase in activity against mustard oils. Functional evolution of GSTD1 was coupled with signatures of episodic positive selection in GstD1 after the evolution of herbivory. Overall, we found that preexisting functions of generalized detoxification systems, and their refinement by natural selection, could play a central role in the evolution of herbivory.",2014,"Noah K Whiteman, Daniel G Vassão, Michael Reichelt, Katharina Schramm, Jonathan Gershenzon, Andrew D Gloss, Timothy J Rast, Andrzej Weichsel, Matthew G Cravens, William R Montfort, Anna C Nelson Dittrich, Alexander L Hailey"

Not surprisingly, multiple cellular and molecular mechanisms contribute to the shape of tubular epithelial structures. One intriguing aspect of epithelial organ formation is the highly coordinate behavior of individual cells as they mold the mature lumen. Here, we focus on recent findings, primarily from Drosophila, demonstrating that informative cues can emanate from the developing organ lumen in the form of solid luminal material.

Proteins involved in the degradation of cytoplasmic mRNA in the major eukaryotic model systems,25483043,10.4161/rna.34406,"The process of mRNA decay and surveillance is considered to be one of the main posttranscriptional gene expression regulation platforms in eukaryotes.

Alternatively, the exosome complex degrades mRNA in the 3'>5'direction.

Archaerhodopsin voltage imaging: synaptic calcium and BK channels stabilize action potential repolarization at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction,25355206,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2203-14.2014,"The strength and dynamics of synaptic transmission are determined, in part, by the presynaptic action potential (AP) waveform at the nerve terminal. The ion channels that shape the synaptic AP waveform remain essentially unknown for all but a few large synapses amenable to electrophysiological interrogation. The Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is a powerful system for studying synaptic biology, but it is not amenable to presynaptic electrophysiology. Here, we demonstrate that Archaerhodopsin can be used to quantitatively image AP waveforms at the Drosophila NMJ without disrupting baseline synaptic transmission or neuromuscular development. It is established that Shaker mutations cause a dramatic increase in neurotransmitter release, suggesting that Shaker is predominantly responsible for AP repolarization. Here we demonstrate that this effect is caused by a concomitant loss of both Shaker and slowpoke (slo) channel activity because of the low extracellular calcium concentrations (0.2-0.5 mM) used typically to assess synaptic transmission in Shaker. In contrast, at physiological extracellular calcium (1.5 mM), the role of Shaker during AP repolarization is limited. We then provide evidence that calcium influx through synaptic CaV2.1 channels and subsequent recruitment of Slo channel activity is important, in concert with Shaker, to ensure proper AP repolarization. Finally, we show that Slo assumes a dominant repolarizing role during repetitive nerve stimulation. During repetitive stimulation, Slo effectively compensates for Shaker channel inactivation, stabilizing AP repolarization and limiting neurotransmitter release. Thus, we have defined an essential role for Slo channels during synaptic AP repolarization and have revised our understanding of Shaker channels at this model synapse.",2014,"Graeme W Davis, Kevin J Ford"

Wolbachia influences the maternal transmission of the gypsy endogenous retrovirus in Drosophila melanogaster,25182324,10.1128/mBio.01529-14,"The endosymbiotic bacteria of the genus Wolbachia are present in most insects and are maternally transmitted through the germline. Moreover, these intracellular bacteria exert antiviral activity against insect RNA viruses, as in Drosophila melanogaster, which could explain the prevalence of Wolbachia bacteria in natural populations. Wolbachia is maternally transmitted in D. melanogaster through a mechanism that involves distribution at the posterior pole of mature oocytes and then incorporation into the pole cells of the embryos. In parallel, maternal transmission of several endogenous retroviruses is well documented in D. melanogaster. Notably, gypsy retrovirus is expressed in permissive follicle cells and transferred to the oocyte and then to the offspring by integrating into their genomes. Here, we show that the presence of Wolbachia wMel reduces the rate of gypsy insertion into the ovo gene. However, the presence of Wolbachia does not modify the expression levels of gypsy RNA and envelope glycoprotein from either permissive or restrictive ovaries. Moreover, Wolbachia affects the pattern of distribution of the retroviral particles and the gypsy envelope protein in permissive follicle cells. Altogether, our results enlarge the knowledge of the antiviral activity of Wolbachia to include reducing the maternal transmission of endogenous retroviruses in D. melanogaster. Importance: Animals have established complex relationships with bacteria and viruses that spread horizontally among individuals or are vertically transmitted, i.e., from parents to offspring. It is well established that members of the genus Wolbachia, maternally inherited symbiotic bacteria present mainly in arthropods, reduce the replication of several RNA viruses transmitted horizontally. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that Wolbachia diminishes the maternal transmission of gypsy, an endogenous retrovirus in Drosophila melanogaster. We hypothesize that gypsy cannot efficiently integrate into the germ cells of offspring during embryonic development in the presence of Wolbachia because both are competitors for localization to the posterior pole of the egg. More generally, it would be of interest to analyze the influence of Wolbachia on vertically transmitted exogenous viruses, such as some arboviruses.",2014,"Christophe Terzian, Franck Touret, François Guiguen"

The Drosophila genome encodes three POs, which are primarily produced as zymogens or prophenoloxidases (PPO). Two of them, PPO1 and PPO2, are produced by crystal cells. Here we have generated flies carrying deletions in PPO1 and PPO2. By analyzing these mutations alone and in combination, we clarify the functions of both PPOs in humoral melanization. Our study shows that PPO1 and PPO2 are responsible for all the PO activity in the hemolymph. While PPO1 is involved in the rapid early delivery of PO activity, PPO2 is accumulated in the crystals of crystal cells and provides a storage form that can be deployed in a later phase.

Proteomic analysis of interaction between P7-1 of Southern rice black-streaked dwarf virus and the insect vector reveals diverse insect proteins involved in successful transmission,24650428,10.1016/j.jprot.2014.03.004,"Southern rice black-streaked dwarf virus (SRBSDV), transmitted by the white-backed planthopper (Sogatella furcifera) in a persistent-propagative manner, has caused serious yield losses in Asia. Here in a yeast two-hybrid system, protein interactions between SRBSDV P7-1 as a bait protein and a cDNA library of S. furcifera as prey protein were assessed. Of 153 proteins identified as putative interactors, 24 were selected for further analysis. Of the 24 proteins, 18 were further confirmed in a chemiluminescent coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay as true positive interactors with different strengths of interactions. Six potential candidate proteins (neuroglian, myosin light chain 2 [MLC2], polyubiquitin, E3 ubiquitin ligase, ribophorin ii, and profilin) were analyzed for gene expression in five organs by qRT-PCR; mRNA levels were highest in the gut for neuroglian, MLC2, polyubiquitin and profilin, in the salivary glands for ribophorin ii, and in the haemolymph for E3 ubiquitin ligase. A virus-host protein interaction network was constructed using SRBSDV P7-1 and 18 prey positive protein homologs of Drosophila melanogaster. Our findings suggest that these proteins are involved in the complex host reaction to infection by SRBSDV and provide new insights into the molecular basis of transmission. Biological significance: Southern rice black-streaked dwarf virus (SRBSDV), transmitted by S. furcifera in a persistent-propagative manner, is a new found virus and a tentative member of the genus Fijivirus in the family Reoviridae. It was widely noted by plant virologist, government officials and the farmers in Asia in recent years because of its epidemic outbreak and causing serious yield losses after 2009. However, the molecular mechanism by which SRBSDV successfully infects and replicates in both plant and insect hosts remains unclear, and much less is known about how the virus spreads from initially infected cells to adjacent cells in the insect vector. In the present study, we examined protein interactions between SRBSDV P7-1 as the bait and cDNA library of WBPH as the prey by using yeast two-hybrid system, 153 proteins were identified as putative interactors and 24 putative proteins were selected for chemiluminescent coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay, and then constructed a viral protein-host protein interaction network with homologs of D. melanogaster.

A stem-loop structure directs oskar mRNA to microtubule minus ends,24572808,10.1261/rna.041566.113,"mRNA transport coupled with translational control underlies the intracellular localization of many proteins in eukaryotic cells. This is exemplified in Drosophila, where oskar mRNA transport and translation at the posterior pole of the oocyte direct posterior patterning of the embryo. oskar localization is a multistep process. Within the oocyte, a spliced oskar localization element (SOLE) targets oskar mRNA for plus end-directed transport by kinesin-1 to the posterior pole. However, the signals mediating the initial minus end-directed, dynein-dependent transport of the mRNA from nurse cells into the oocyte have remained unknown. Here, we show that a 67-nt stem-loop in the oskar 3' UTR promotes oskar mRNA delivery to the developing oocyte and that it shares functional features with the fs(1)K10 oocyte localization signal. Thus, two independent cis-acting signals, the oocyte entry signal (OES) and the SOLE, mediate sequential dynein- and kinesin-dependent phases of oskar mRNA transport during oogenesis. The OES also promotes apical localization of injected RNAs in blastoderm stage embryos, another dynein-mediated process. Similarly, when ectopically expressed in polarized cells of the follicular epithelium or salivary glands, reporter RNAs bearing the oskar OES are apically enriched, demonstrating that this element promotes mRNA localization independently of cell type. Our work sheds new light on how oskar mRNA is trafficked during oogenesis and the RNA features that mediate minus end-directed transport.",2014,"Helena Jambor, Anne Ephrussi, Sandra Mueller, Simon L Bullock"
Targeted mutagenesis of the Sap47 gene of Drosophila: flies lacking the synapse associated protein of 47 kDa are viable and fertile,15117418,10.1186/1471-2202-5-16,"Background: Conserved proteins preferentially expressed in synaptic terminals of the nervous system are likely to play a significant role in brain function. We have previously identified and molecularly characterized the Sap47 gene which codes for a novel synapse associated protein of 47 kDa in Drosophila. Sequence comparison identifies homologous proteins in numerous species including C. elegans, fish, mouse and human. First hints as to the function of this novel protein family can be obtained by generating mutants for the Sap47 gene in Drosophila. Results: Attempts to eliminate the Sap47 gene through targeted mutagenesis by homologous recombination were unsuccessful. However, several mutants were generated by transposon remobilization after an appropriate insertion line had become available from the Drosophila P-element screen of the Bellen/Hoskins/Rubin/Spradling labs. Characterization of various deletions in the Sap47 gene due to imprecise excision of the P-element identified three null mutants and three hypomorphic mutants. Null mutants are viable and fertile and show no gross structural or obvious behavioural deficits. For cell-specific over-expression and ""rescue"" of the knock-out flies a transgenic line was generated which expresses the most abundant transcript under the control of the yeast enhancer UAS. In addition, knock-down of the Sap47 gene was achieved by generating 31 transgenic lines expressing Sap47 RNAi constructs, again under UAS control. When driven by a ubiquitously expressed yeast transcription factor (GAL4), Sap47 gene suppression in several of these lines is highly efficient resulting in residual SAP47 protein concentrations in heads as low as 6% of wild type levels. Conclusion: The conserved synaptic protein SAP47 of Drosophila is not essential for basic synaptic function. The Sap47 gene region may be refractory to targeted mutagenesis by homologous recombination. RNAi using a construct linking genomic DNA to anti-sense cDNA in our hands is not more effective than using a cDNA-anti-sense cDNA construct. The tools developed in this study will now allow a detailed analysis of the molecular, cellular and systemic function of the SAP47 protein in Drosophila.",2004,"Saskia Huber, Natalja Funk, Sonja Becker, Erich Buchner, Marion Brunner"
Glucose dehydrogenase is required for normal sperm storage and utilization in female Drosophila melanogaster,14718510,10.1242/jeb.00816,"Female sperm storage is a key factor for reproductive success in a variety of organisms, including Drosophila melanogaster. The spermathecae, one of the Drosophila sperm storage organs, has been suggested as a long-term storage organ because its secreted substances may enhance the quality of sperm storage. Glucose dehydrogenase (GLD) is widely expressed and secreted in the spermathecal ducts among species of the genus Drosophila. This highly conserved expression pattern suggests that this enzyme might have an important role in female fertility. Here, we examine the function of GLD in sperm storage and utilization using Gld-null mutant females. The absence of GLD reduced the amount of sperm stored in the spermathecae and led to a highly asymmetrical sperm distribution in the two spermathecal capsules of the mutant females. The storage defect was especially severe when the mutant females were crossed to a Gld-mutant male that had previously mated a few hours before the experimental cross. Under this mating condition, the mutant females stored in the spermathecae only one-third of the sperm amount of the wild-type control females. In addition, the mutant females used stored sperm at a slower rate over a longer period compared with wild-type females. Thus, our results indicate that GLD facilitates both sperm uptake and release through the spermathecal ducts.",2004,"Douglas R Cavener, Kaori Iida"
Stochastic yet biased expression of multiple Dscam splice variants by individual cells,14758360,10.1038/ng1299,"The Drosophila melanogaster gene Dscam is essential for axon guidance and has 38,016 possible alternative splice forms. This diversity can potentially be used to distinguish cells. We analyzed the Dscam mRNA isoforms expressed by different cell types and individual cells. The choice of splice variants expressed is regulated both spatially and temporally. Different subtypes of photoreceptors express broad yet distinctive spectra of Dscam isoforms. Single-cell RT-PCR documented that individual cells express several different Dscam isoforms and allowed an estimation of the diversity that is present. For example, we estimate that each R3/R4 photoreceptor cell expresses 14-50 distinct mRNAs chosen from the spectrum of thousands of splice variants distinctive of its cell type. Thus, the Dscam repertoire of each cell is different from those of its neighbors, providing a potential mechanism for generating unique cell identity in the nervous system and elsewhere.",2004,"Guilherme Neves, Jacob Zucker, Andrew Chess, Mark Daly"

Afferent induction of olfactory glomeruli requires N-cadherin,15066266,10.1016/s0896-6273(04)00158-8,"Drosophila olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) elaborate a precise internal representation of the external olfactory world in the antennal lobe (AL), a structure analagous to the vertebrate olfactory bulb. ORNs expressing the same odorant receptor innervate common targets in a highly organized neuropilar structure inside the AL, the glomerulus. During normal development, ORNs target to specific regions of the AL and segregate into subclass-specific aggregates called protoglomeruli prior to extensive intermingling with target dendrites to form mature glomeruli. Using a panel of ORN subclass-specific markers, we demonstrate that in the adult AL, N-cadherin (N-cad) mutant ORN terminals remain segregated from dendrites of target neurons. N-cad plays a crucial role in protoglomerulus formation but is largely dispensible for targeting to the appropriate region of the AL. We propose that N-cad, a homophilic cell adhesion molecule, acts in a permissive fashion to promote subclass-specific sorting of ORN axon terminals into protoglomeruli.",2004,"S Lawrence Zipursky, Thomas Hummel"

The preparation of enriched enzyme without the contamination by an inhibitor, which is traditionally used for eluting the ""affinity"" bound protein, was achieved. The specific activity was 2.2-fold increased to 3100 Umg(-1).

Requirement for Par-6 and Bazooka in Drosophila border cell migration,15456726,10.1242/dev.01412,"Polarized epithelial cells convert into migratory invasive cells during a number of developmental processes, as well as when tumors metastasize. Much has been learned recently concerning the molecules and mechanisms that are responsible for generating and maintaining epithelial cell polarity. However, less is known about what becomes of epithelial polarity proteins when various cell types become migratory and invasive. Here, we report the localization of several apical epithelial proteins, Par-6, Par-3/Bazooka and aPKC, during border cell migration in the Drosophila ovary. All of these proteins remained asymmetrically distributed throughout migration. Moreover, depletion of either Par-6 or Par-3/Bazooka by RNAi resulted in disorganization of the border cell cluster and impaired migration. The distributions of several transmembrane proteins required for migration were abnormal following Par-6 or Par-3/Bazooka downregulation, possibly accounting for the migration defects. Taken together, these results indicate that cells need not lose apical/basal polarity in order to invade neighboring tissues and in some cases even require such polarity for proper motility.",2004,"Elaine M Pinheiro, Denise J Montell"
Glycogen synthase kinase 3beta as a likely target for the action of lithium on circadian clocks,15129823,10.1081/cbi-120027981,"Although lithium is one of the most commonly used drugs in the prophylaxis and treatment of bipolar disorder, the mechanisms underlying its therapeutic action are still unclear. Together with its mood-stabilizing effects, lithium is also known to influence the circadian clocks of several organisms including man. Circadian rhythms are altered in patients with bipolar disorder, and it is believed that these rhythms may play an important role in disease mechanisms. It is therefore possible that some of the therapeutic actions of lithium may be related to its effect on circadian clocks. Identifying the targets for lithium's action on circadian clocks would therefore be important both for understanding the mechanisms of its therapeutic effect and also in further understanding disease mechanisms in bipolar disorders. Using Drosophila melanogaster as a model system, we show that long-term administration of lithium results in lengthening of the free-running period (tau) of circadian locomotor activity rhythm of flies in constant darkness (DD). This effect occurs at concentrations similar to the plasma levels of lithium used in the treatment of bipolar disorder. The lithium-treated flies also show reduced activity of one of the previously reported targets of lithium action, Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3beta (GSK 3beta). GSK 3beta has been shown to be involved in the regulation of circadian clocks as the down regulation of this protein results in an elongation of tau. The tau elongation resembles the effect seen with lithium administration in a number of organisms including man, and taken together with the earlier observations our results suggest that lithium inhibits the activity of GSK 3beta to produce its effect on circadian clocks.",2004,"Vijay Kumar Sharma, Quasar Saleem Padiath, Dhanashree Paranjpe, Sanjeev Jain"

Tiel (Culicidae, Diptera) chromosome 2 (2R) was generated by use of chromosome microdissection technique. Southern-blot hybridization of the minilibrary fragments with the labeled genomic DNA of A. atroparvus and analysis of their primary structure showed that this heterochromatin region contained repeated DNA sequences differed by their primary structure and the number of copies. These were mostly AT-rich sequences harboring the features characteristic of the S/MAR regions.

Heat induced male sterility in Drosophila melanogaster: adaptive genetic variations among geographic populations and role of the Y chromosome,15235002,10.1242/jeb.01087,"We analyzed genetic variation among geographically diverse populations of Drosophila and showed that tropical flies are more tolerant than temperate ones to heat-induced male sterility, as assessed by the presence of both motile sperm and progeny production. In tropical populations, the temperature inducing 50% sterility (median threshold) is 1 degrees C above the value for temperate populations (30.4 vs. 29.4 degrees C). When transferred to a mild permissive temperature (21 degrees C), males recover fertility. Recovery time is proportional to pre-adult culture temperature. At these temperatures, recovery time is greater for temperate than for tropical populations. Crosses between a temperate and a tropical strain (F1, F2 and successive backcrosses) revealed that the Y chromosome was responsible for much of the geographic variation. Sterile males exhibited diverse abnormalities in the shape and position of sperm nuclei. However, impairment of the spermatid elongation seems to be the major factor responsible for sperm inviability. Heat-induced male sterility seems to be quite a general phenomenon in Drosophilid species and variation of threshold temperatures may be important for explaining their geographic distributions.",2004,"Jean R David, Brigitte Moreteau, Dominique Joly, Céline Rohmer"
cuticleDB: a relational database of Arthropod cuticular proteins,15453918,10.1186/1471-2105-5-138,"Background: The insect exoskeleton or cuticle is a bi-partite composite of proteins and chitin that provides protective, skeletal and structural functions. Little information is available about the molecular structure of this important complex that exhibits a helicoidal architecture. Scores of sequences of cuticular proteins have been obtained from direct protein sequencing, from cDNAs, and from genomic analyses. Most of these cuticular protein sequences contain motifs found only in arthropod proteins. Description: cuticleDB is a relational database containing all structural proteins of Arthropod cuticle identified to date. Many come from direct sequencing of proteins isolated from cuticle and from sequences from cDNAs that share common features with these authentic cuticular proteins.

Two Drosophila suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) differentially regulate JAK and EGFR pathway activities,15488148,10.1186/1471-2121-5-38,"Background: The Janus kinase (JAK) cascade is an essential and well-conserved pathway required to transduce signals for a variety of ligands in both vertebrates and invertebrates. While activation of the pathway is essential to many processes, mutations from mammals and Drosophila demonstrate that regulation is also critical. The SOCS (Suppressor Of Cytokine Signaling) proteins in mammals are regulators of the JAK pathway that participate in a negative feedback loop, as they are transcriptionally activated by JAK signaling. Examination of one Drosophila SOCS homologue, Socs36E, demonstrated that its expression is responsive to JAK pathway activity and it is capable of downregulating JAK signaling, similar to the well characterized mammalian SOCS. Results: Based on sequence analysis of the Drosophila genome, there are three identifiable SOCS homologues in flies. All three are most similar to mammalian SOCS that have not been extensively characterized: Socs36E is most similar to mammalian SOCS5, while Socs44A and Socs16D are most similar to mammalian SOCS6 and 7. Although Socs44A is capable of repressing JAK activity in some tissues, its expression is not regulated by the pathway. Furthermore, Socs44A can enhance the activity of the EGFR/MAPK signaling cascade, in contrast to Socs36E. Conclusions: Two Drosophila SOCS proteins have some overlapping and some distinct capabilities. While Socs36E behaves similarly to the canonical vertebrate SOCS, Socs44A is not part of a JAK pathway negative feedback loop. Nonetheless, both SOCS regulate JAK and EGFR signaling pathways, albeit differently. The non-canonical properties of Socs44A may be representative of the class of less characterized vertebrate SOCS with which it shares greatest similarity.",2004,"Jason S Rawlings, Susan M W Harrison, Gabriela Rennebeck, Rongwen Xi, Douglas A Harrison"

Multilocus tests based on Tajima's D statistic revealed a significant departure from neutral expectations in a stationary panmictic population, with an important contribution from both positive and negative D values. A positive relationship between Tajima's D values and distance to coding region was detected, with a comparative excess of significantly negative D values in the subset of fragments closer to coding regions. Also, there was a significant heterogeneity in the polymorphism to divergence ratio, with 12 fragments contributing 42% to the test statistic.

The transient expression analysis revealed the nuclear localization of SIM proteins in the cultured cells. To identify the nuclear localization signal, we made expression constructs of EGFP-fusion protein consisting of various portions of SIM proteins. Transfection assay showed the presence of NLS activity in the small region of 23 and 21 amino acid residues at the central part of SIM2 and SIM1 proteins, respectively. Further analysis with amino acid substitution of this small region of SIM2 protein revealed the critical role of five amino acid residues (Arg367, Lys373, Pro385, Tyr386, and Gln389) in NLS activity. The consensus sequence of RKxxKx[K/R]xxxxKxKxRxxPY was estimated as a presumptive NLS in SIM proteins from various species.

Selective induction of matrix metalloproteinases by Borrelia burgdorferi via toll-like receptor 2 in monocytes,14702161,10.1086/380414,"Regulation of secretion of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) underlies the basis of numerous physiological and pathological processes in multicellular organisms. The Toll receptor family, which is conserved from Drosophila species to humans, mediates pattern recognition of a diversity of ligands involved in morphogenesis and innate immunity.

Secretion of MMP-1 was shown to be stimulated through a pathway other than TLR2, under identical conditions. Analysis of nuclear extracts indicated that activator protein (AP)-1 was reduced in TLR2-neutralized monocytic cells, suggesting that AP-1 plays a role in the transcriptional activation of MMP-9 through TLR2. The specific induction of MMP-9 through TLR2 provides direct evidence of a new role for this ancient receptor family in regulating secretion of MMPs and demonstrates evolutionary convergence between invertebrate morphogenesis and the vertebrate innate immune system.",2004,"Joseph A Gebbia, Jorge L Benach, James L Coleman"
Drosophila dMyc is required for ovary cell growth and endoreplication,14724122,10.1242/dev.00932,"Although the Myc oncogene has long been known to play a role in many human cancers, the mechanisms that mediate its effects in both normal cells and cancer cells are not fully understood. We have initiated a genetic analysis of the Drosophila homolog of the Myc oncoprotein (dMyc), which is encoded by the dm locus. We carried out mosaic analysis to elucidate the functions of dMyc in the germline and somatic cells of the ovary during oogenesis, a process that involves cell proliferation, differentiation and growth. Germline and somatic follicle cells mutant for dm exhibit a profound decrease in their ability to grow and to carry out endoreplication, a modified cell cycle in which DNA replication occurs in the absence of cell division. In contrast to its dramatic effects on growth and endoreplication, dMyc is dispensable for the mitotic division cycles of both germline and somatic components of the ovary. Surprisingly, despite their impaired ability to endoreplicate, dm mutant follicle cells appeared to carry out chorion gene amplification normally. Furthermore, in germline cysts in which the dm mutant cells comprised only a subset of the 16-cell cluster, we observed strictly cell-autonomous growth defects. However, in cases in which the entire germline cyst or the whole follicular epithelium was mutant for dm, the growth of the entire follicle, including the wild-type cells, was delayed. This observation indicates the existence of a signaling mechanism that acts to coordinate the growth rates of the germline and somatic components of the follicle. In summary, dMyc plays an essential role in promoting the rapid growth that must occur in both the germline and the surrounding follicle cells for oogenesis to proceed.",2004,"Jean Z Maines, Xianglan Tong, Leslie M Stevens, David Stein"
A Bax/Bak-independent mitochondrial death pathway triggered by Drosophila Grim GH3 domain in mammalian cells,14551193,10.1074/jbc.M309819200,"Grim encodes a protein required for programmed cell death in Drosophila, whose proapoptotic activity is conserved in mammalian cells. Two proapoptotic domains are relevant for Grim killing function; the N-terminal region, which induces apoptosis by disrupting inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) blockage of caspase activity, and the internal GH3 domain, which triggers a mitochondrial pathway. We explored the role of these two domains in heterologous killing of mammalian cells by Grim. The GH3 domain is essential for Grim proapoptotic activity in mouse cells, whereas the N-terminal domain is dispensable. The GH3 domain is required and sufficient for Grim targeting to mitochondria and for cytochrome c release in a caspase- and N-terminal-independent, IAP-insensitive manner. These Grim GH3 activities do not require Bax or Bak function, revealing GH3 activity as the first proapoptotic stimulus able to trigger the mitochondrial death pathway in mammalian cells in the absence of multidomain proapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins.",2004,"Cristina Claveria, Carlos Martinez-A, Miguel Torres"
Molecular and comparative genetics of mental retardation,15020472,10.1534/genetics.166.2.835,"Affecting 1-3% of the population, mental retardation (MR) poses significant challenges for clinicians and scientists. Understanding the biology of MR is complicated by the extraordinary heterogeneity of genetic MR disorders. Detailed analyses of >1000 Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database entries and literature searches through September 2003 revealed 282 molecularly identified MR genes. We estimate that hundreds more MR genes remain to be identified. A novel test, in which we distributed unmapped MR disorders proportionately across the autosomes, failed to eliminate the well-known X-chromosome overrepresentation of MR genes and candidate genes. This evidence argues against ascertainment bias as the main cause of the skewed distribution. On the basis of a synthesis of clinical and laboratory data, we developed a biological functions classification scheme for MR genes. Metabolic pathways, signaling pathways, and transcription are the most common functions, but numerous other aspects of neuronal and glial biology are controlled by MR genes as well. Using protein sequence and domain-organization comparisons, we found a striking conservation of MR genes and genetic pathways across the approximately 700 million years that separate Homo sapiens and Drosophila melanogaster. Eighty-seven percent have one or more fruit fly homologs and 76% have at least one candidate functional ortholog.

Sequence-specific targeting of MSL complex regulates transcription of the roX RNA genes,15229655,10.1038/sj.emboj.7600299,"In Drosophila, dosage compensation is controlled by the male-specific lethal (MSL) complex consisting of at least five proteins and two noncoding RNAs, roX1 and roX2.

An MSL-binding site (DHS, DNaseI hypersensitive site) has been identified in each roX gene. Here, we investigate the functions of the DHS using transgenic deletion analyses and reporter assays. We find that MSL interaction with the DHS counteracts constitutive repression at roX1, resulting in male-specific expression of roX1 RNA. Surprisingly, the DHS is not required for initiation of cis spreading of MSL complex, instead local transcription of roX RNAs correlates with extensive spreading.",2004,"Xiaoying Bai, Artyom A Alekseyenko, Mitzi I Kuroda"
A conserved postsynaptic transmembrane protein affecting neuromuscular signaling in Caenorhabditis elegans,14999070,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5462-03.2004,"For a motor unit to function, neurons and muscle cells need to adopt their correct cell fate, form appropriate cellular contacts, and assemble a specific repertoire of signaling proteins into presynaptic and postsynaptic structures. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, a disruption of any of these steps causes uncoordinated locomotory behavior (unc phenotype). We report here the positional cloning of a new unc gene, unc-122, which we show by mosaic analysis and tissue-specific rescue experiments to act in muscle to affect locomotory behavior. unc-122 codes for a phylogenetically conserved type II transmembrane protein with collagen repeats and a cysteine-rich olfactomedin domain. Together with uncharacterized proteins in C. elegans, Drosophila, and vertebrates, UNC-122 defines a novel family of proteins that we term ""Colmedins."" UNC-122 protein is expressed exclusively in muscle and coelomocytes and localizes to the postsynaptic surface of GABAergic and cholinergic neuromuscular junctions (NMJs). Presynaptic and postsynaptic structures are present and properly aligned in unc-122 mutant animals, yet the animals display neurotransmission defects characterized by an altered sensitivity toward drugs that interfere with cholinergic signaling. Moreover, unc-122 mutant animals display anatomical defects in motor axons that are likely a secondary consequence of neurotransmission defects. Both the neuroanatomical and locomotory defects worsen progressively during the life of an animal, consistent with a role of unc-122 in acute signaling at the NMJ. On the basis of motifs in the UNC-122 protein sequence that are characteristic of extracellular matrix proteins, we propose that UNC-122 is involved in maintaining a structural microenvironment that allows efficient neuromuscular signaling.",2004,"Oliver Hobert, Jonathan Hodgkin, Paula M Loria"
Cascade pathway of filopodia formation downstream of SCAR,14762109,10.1242/jcs.00921,"The protrusion of two distinct actin-containing organelles, lamellipodia and filopodia, is thought to be regulated by two parallel pathways: from Rac1 through Scar/WAVEs to lamellipodia, and from Cdc42 through N-WASP to filopodia. We tested this hypothesis in Drosophila, which contains a single gene for each WASP subfamilies, SCAR and WASp. We performed targeted depletion of SCAR or WASp by dsRNA-mediated interference in two Drosophila cultured cell lines expressing lamellipodial and filopodial protrusion. Knockdown was verified by laser capture microdissection and RT-PCR, as well as western blotting. Morphometrical, kinetic and electron microscopy analyses of the SCAR-depleted phenotype in both cell types revealed strong inhibition of lamellipodial formation and cell spreading, as expected. More importantly, filopodia formation was also strongly inhibited, which is not consistent with the parallel pathway hypothesis. By contrast, depletion of WASp did not produce any significant phenotype, except for a slight inhibition of spreading, showing that both lamellipodia and filopodia in Drosophila cells are regulated predominantly by SCAR. We propose a new, cascade pathway model of filopodia regulation in which SCAR signals to lamellipodia and then filopodia arise from lamellipodia in response to additional signal(s).",2004,"Gary Borisy, Assel Biyasheva, Tatyana Svitkina, Patricia Kunda, Buzz Baum"
Regulation of Drosophila Development by the Golgi Kinase Four-Jointed,28236966,10.1016/bs.ctdb.2016.11.003,"Despite intensive research on kinases and protein phosphorylation, most studies focus on kinases localized to the cytosol and nucleus. Studies in Drosophila discovered a novel signaling pathway that regulates growth and planar cell polarity. In this pathway, the atypical cadherin Fat acts as a receptor, and the cadherin Dachsous (Ds) serves as its ligand. Genetic studies in Drosophila identified the four-jointed gene as a regulator of the Fat pathway. Four-jointed (Fj) resides in the Golgi and phosphorylates the cadherin domains of Fat and Ds. Fj-mediated phosphorylations promote the ability of Fat to bind to its ligand Ds and inhibit the ability of Ds to bind Fat, which is biased toward a stronger effect on Fat. Fj is expressed in a gradient in many developing tissues. The Fat-Ds-binding gradient can be explained by the graded activity of Fj that is sufficient to propagate the polarization of complexes across whole tissues. Recent studies revealed a new class of kinases that localize within the secretory pathway and the extracellular space, and phosphorylate proteins and sugar chains in the secretory pathway. Further, they appear to regulate extracellular processes. Mutations of the genes encoding these kinases cause human disease, thus underscoring the biological importance of phosphorylation events within the secretory pathway.",2017,"Yoko Keira, Moe Wada, Hiroyuki O Ishikawa"
Mutations in the X-linked ATP6AP2 cause a glycosylation disorder with autophagic defects,29127204,10.1084/jem.20170453,"The biogenesis of the multi-subunit vacuolar-type H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) is initiated in the endoplasmic reticulum with the assembly of the proton pore V0, which is controlled by a group of assembly factors. Here, we identify two hemizygous missense mutations in the extracellular domain of the accessory V-ATPase subunit ATP6AP2 (also known as the [pro]renin receptor) responsible for a glycosylation disorder with liver disease, immunodeficiency, cutis laxa, and psychomotor impairment. We show that ATP6AP2 deficiency in the mouse liver caused hypoglycosylation of serum proteins and autophagy defects. The introduction of one of the missense mutations into Drosophila led to reduced survival and altered lipid metabolism. We further demonstrate that in the liver-like fat body, the autophagic dysregulation was associated with defects in lysosomal acidification and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. Finally, both ATP6AP2 mutations impaired protein stability and the interaction with ATP6AP1, a member of the V0 assembly complex.

Ultra-selective looming detection from radial motion opponency,29120418,10.1038/nature24626,"Nervous systems combine lower-level sensory signals to detect higher-order stimulus features critical to survival, such as the visual looming motion created by an imminent collision or approaching predator. Looming-sensitive neurons have been identified in diverse animal species. Different large-scale visual features such as looming often share local cues, which means loom-detecting neurons face the challenge of rejecting confounding stimuli. Here we report the discovery of an ultra-selective looming detecting neuron, lobula plate/lobula columnar, type II (LPLC2) in Drosophila, and show how its selectivity is established by radial motion opponency. In the fly visual system, directionally selective small-field neurons called T4 and T5 form a spatial map in the lobula plate, where they each terminate in one of four retinotopic layers, such that each layer responds to motion in a different cardinal direction. Single-cell anatomical analysis reveals that each arm of the LPLC2 cross-shaped primary dendrites ramifies in one of these layers and extends along that layer's preferred motion direction. In vivo calcium imaging demonstrates that, as their shape predicts, individual LPLC2 neurons respond strongly to outward motion emanating from the centre of the neuron's receptive field. Each dendritic arm also receives local inhibitory inputs directionally selective for inward motion opposing the excitation. This radial motion opponency generates a balance of excitation and inhibition that makes LPLC2 non-responsive to related patterns of motion such as contraction, wide-field rotation or luminance change. As a population, LPLC2 neurons densely cover visual space and terminate onto the giant fibre descending neurons, which drive the jump muscle motor neuron to trigger an escape take off. Our findings provide a mechanistic description of the selective feature detection that flies use to discern and escape looming threats.",2017,"Nathan C Klapoetke, Michael B Reiser, Gwyneth M Card, Gerald M Rubin, Patrick Breads, Edward M Rogers, Martin Y Peek, Aljoscha Nern"
Fat storage in Drosophila suzukii is influenced by different dietary sugars in relation to their palatability,28817633,10.1371/journal.pone.0183173,"The peripheral sensitivity and palatability of different carbohydrates was evaluated and their nutritional value assessed in adult females of D. suzukii by means of an electrophysiological, behavioural and metabolic approach. The electrophysiological responses were recorded from the labellar ""l"" type sensilla stimulated with metabolizable mono- and disaccharides (glucose and maltose) and a non-metabolizable sugar (sucralose); the response rating and the palatability to the same sugars, evaluated by recording the proboscis extension reflex (PER), was maltose>glucose>sucralose. The nutritional value of carbohydrates was assessed by means of survival trials and fatty acids profile. Flies fed on a diet containing maltose had a longer lifespan than flies on monosaccharides, while flies fed on a diet containing sucralose had a shorter one. In addition, the ability to store fat seems to be influenced by the different sugars in the diet and is in relationship with their palatability. In fact, data showed a higher synthesis of palmitic and palmitoleic acids, most likely derived from de-novo lipogenesis with glucose as precursor, in flies fed with maltose and glucose than with non-metabolizable sucralose. In conclusion, these results suggest that the ability to select different sugars on the basis of their palatability may favour the storage of energy reserves such as fat by de-novo lipogenesis, determining a longer survival capability during prolonged periods of fasting.",2017,"Roberto Crnjar, Elisabetta Murru, Gianfranco Anfora, Maurizio Biolchini, Francesco Loy, Sebastiano Banni, Giorgia Sollai"

Strikingly, however, satellite cells, the adult muscle stem cells that are essential for the regeneration of damaged muscles in vertebrates, have not been reported in invertebrates. In this study, we show that lineal descendants of muscle stem cells are present in adult muscle of Drosophila as small, unfused cells observed at the surface and in close proximity to the mature muscle fibers. Normally quiescent, following muscle fiber injury, we show that these cells express Zfh1 and engage in Notch-Delta-dependent proliferative activity and generate lineal descendant populations, which fuse with the injured muscle fiber.

Phosphoenolpyruvate Carboxykinase Maintains Glycolysis-driven Growth in Drosophila Tumors,28912546,10.1038/s41598-017-11613-2,"Tumors frequently fail to pass on all their chromosomes correctly during cell division, and this chromosomal instability (CIN) causes irregular aneuploidy and oxidative stress in cancer cells. Our objective was to test knockdowns of metabolic enzymes in Drosophila to find interventions that could exploit the differences between normal and CIN cells to block CIN tumor growth without harming the host animal. We found that depleting by RNAi or feeding the host inhibitors against phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) was able to block the growth of CIN tissue in a brat tumor explant model. Increasing NAD+ or oxidising cytoplasmic NADH was able to rescue the growth of PEPCK depleted tumors, suggesting a problem in clearing cytoplasmic NADH. Consistent with this, blocking the glycerol-3-phosphate shuttle blocked tumor growth, as well as lowering ROS levels. This work suggests that proliferating CIN cells are particularly vulnerable to inhibition of PEPCK, or its metabolic network, because of their compromised redox status.",2017,"Stephen L Gregory, Zeeshan Shaukat, Rashid Hussain, Mahwish Khan, Robert Saint"
Influence of epistasis on response to genomic selection using complete sequence data,28841821,10.1186/s12711-017-0340-3,"Background: The effect of epistasis on response to selection is a highly debated topic. Here, we investigated the impact of epistasis on response to sequence-based selection via genomic best linear prediction (GBLUP) in a regime of strong non-symmetrical epistasis under divergent selection, using real Drosophila sequence data. We also explored the possible advantage of including epistasis in the evaluation model and/or of knowing the causal mutations. Results: Response to selection was almost exclusively due to changes in allele frequency at a few loci with a large effect. Response was highly asymmetric (about four phenotypic standard deviations higher for upward than downward selection) due to the highly skewed site frequency spectrum. Epistasis accentuated this asymmetry and affected response to selection by modulating the additive genetic variance, which was sustained for longer under upward selection whereas it eroded rapidly under downward selection. Response to selection was quite insensitive to the evaluation model, especially under an additive scenario. Nevertheless, including epistasis in the model when there was none eventually led to lower accuracies as selection proceeded. Accounting for epistasis in the model, if it existed, was beneficial but only in the medium term. There was not much gain in response if causal mutations were known, compared to using sequence data, which is likely due to strong linkage disequilibrium, high heritability and availability of phenotypes on candidates. Conclusions: Epistatic interactions affect the response to genomic selection by modulating the additive genetic variance used for selection. Epistasis releases additive variance that may increase response to selection compared to a pure additive genetic action. Furthermore, genomic evaluation models and, in particular, GBLUP are robust, i.e. adding complexity to the model did not modify substantially the response (for a given architecture).",2017,"Zulma G Vitezica, Andres Legarra, Miguel Pérez-Enciso, Natalia S Forneris"
Patterning of the Drosophila L2 vein is driven by regulatory interactions between region-specific transcription factors expressed in response to Dpp signalling,28760811,10.1242/dev.143461,"Pattern formation relies on the generation of transcriptional landscapes regulated by signalling pathways. A paradigm of epithelial patterning is the distribution of vein territories in the Drosophila wing disc. In this tissue, Decapentaplegic signalling regulates its target genes at different distances from the source of the ligand. The transformation of signalling into coherent territories of gene expression requires regulatory cross-interactions between these target genes. Here, we analyse the mechanisms generating the domain of knirps expression in the presumptive L2 vein of the wing imaginal disc. We find that knirps is regulated by four Decapentaplegic target genes encoding the transcription factors aristaless, spalt major, spalt-related and optix The expression of optix is activated by Dpp and repressed by the Spalt proteins, becoming restricted to the most anterior region of the wing blade. In turn, the expression of knirps is activated by Aristaless and repressed by Optix and the Spalt proteins. In this manner, the expression of knirps becomes restricted to those cells where Spalt levels are sufficient to repress optix, but not sufficient to repress knirps.",2017,"Mercedes Martín, Cristina M Ostalé, Jose F de Celis"

However, the function of Thioester-containing proteins (TEPs) in the fly still remains elusive. Recently we have shown the contribution of TEP4 in the antibacterial immune defense of Drosophila against non-pathogenic E. coli, and the pathogens Photorhabdus luminescens and P. asymbiotica. Here we studied the function of Tep genes in both humoral and cellular immunity upon E. coli and Photorhabdus infection. We found that while Tep2 is induced after Photorhabdus and E. coli infection; Tep6 is induced by P. asymbiotica only. Moreover, functional ablation of hemocytes results in significantly low transcript levels of Tep2 and Tep6 in response to Photorhabdus. We show that Tep2 and Tep6 loss-of-function mutants have prolonged survival against P. asymbiotica, Tep6 mutants survive better the infection of P. luminescens, and both tep mutants are resistant to E. coli and Photorhabdus. We also find a distinct pattern of immune signaling pathway induction in E. coli or Photorhabdus infected Tep2 and Tep6 mutants. We further show that Tep2 and Tep6 participate in the activation of hemocytes in Drosophila responding to Photorhabdus. Finally, inactivation of Tep2 or Tep6 affects phagocytosis and melanization in flies infected with Photorhabdus.

Amyloid Precursor Protein in Drosophila Glia Regulates Sleep and Genes Involved in Glutamate Recycling,28314820,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2826-16.2017,"Amyloid precursor protein (App) plays a crucial role in Alzheimer's disease via the production and deposition of toxic β-amyloid peptides. App is heavily expressed in neurons, the focus of the vast majority of studies investigating its function. Meanwhile, almost nothing is known about App's function in glia, where it is also expressed, and can potentially participate in the regulation of neuronal physiology. In this report, we investigated whether Appl, the Drosophila homolog of App, could influence sleep-wake regulation when its function is manipulated in glial cells. Appl inhibition in astrocyte-like and cortex glia resulted in higher sleep amounts and longer sleep bout duration during the night, while overexpression had the opposite effect. These sleep phenotypes were not the result of developmental defects, and were correlated with changes in expression in glutamine synthetase (GS) in astrocyte-like glia and in changes in the gap-junction component innexin2 in cortex glia. Downregulating both GS and innexin2, but not either one individually, resulted in higher sleep amounts, similarly to Appl inhibition. Consistent with these results, the expression of GS and innexin2 are increased following sleep deprivation, indicating that GS and innexin2 genes are dynamically linked to vigilance states. Interestingly, the reduction of GS expression and the sleep phenotype observed upon Appl inhibition could be rescued by increasing the expression of the glutamate transporter dEaat1. In contrast, reducing dEaat1 expression severely disrupted sleep. These results associate glutamate recycling, sleep, and a glial function for the App family proteins.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The amyloid precursor protein (App) has been intensively studied for its implication in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The attributed functions of App are linked to the physiology and cellular biology of neurons where the protein is predominantly expressed. Consequences on glia in AD are generally thought to be secondary effects of the pathology in neurons. Researchers still do not know whether App plays a role in glia in nonpathological conditions. We report here that glial App plays a role in physiology and in the regulation of sleep/wake, which has been shown recently to be involved in AD pathology. These results also associate glutamate recycling and sleep regulation, adding further complexity to the physiological role of App and to its implication in AD.",2017,"Abud Jose Farca Luna, Magali Perier, Laurent Seugnet"
Differential protective effects of connective tissue growth factor against Aβ neurotoxicity on neurons and glia,29016849,10.1093/hmg/ddx278,"Impaired clearance of amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) leads to abnormal extracellular accumulation of this neurotoxic protein that drives neurodegeneration in sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF/CCN2) expression is elevated in plaque-surrounding astrocytes in AD patients. However, the role of CTGF in AD pathogenesis remains unclear. Here we characterized the neuroprotective activity of CTGF. We found that CTGF facilitated Aβ uptake and subsequent degradation within primary glia and neuroblastoma cells. CTGF enhanced extracellular Aβ degradation via membrane-bound matrix metalloproteinase-14 (MMP14) in glia and extracellular MMP13 in neurons. In the brain of a Drosophila AD model, glial-expression of CTGF reduced Aβ deposits, improved locomotor function, and rescued memory deficits. Neuroprotective potential of CTGF against Aβ42-induced photoreceptor degeneration was disrupted through silencing MMPs. Therefore, CTGF may represent a node for potential AD therapeutics as it intervenes in glia-neuron communication via specific MMPs to alleviate Aβ neurotoxicity in the central nervous system.",2017,"Chia-Lin Wu, Sze-Kwan Lin, Chih-Chiang Chan, Min-Fang Wu, Young-Ji Shiao, Horng-Huei Liou, Yu-Chin Chang, Wei-Hung Jung, Wang-Pao Lee, Chung-Chih Liu, Cheng-Ning Yang"

Here, we study the collective oscillations in the Drosophila amnioserosa tissue to elucidate the regulatory roles of the mechanical components. We identify that the tensile stress is the key activator that switches the collective oscillations on and off. This regulatory role is shown analytically using the Hopf bifurcation theory.

The study of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling led to the first description of a mechanism whereby an extracellular signal is transmitted to the nucleus to induce a transcriptional response.

Using in vivo ATP imaging, we found that neuronal cellular ATP levels during development are not correlated with the progression of dendritic loss. We searched for mitochondrial stress signaling pathways that induce dendritic loss and found that mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with increased eIF2α phosphorylation, which is sufficient to induce dendritic pathology in class IV arborization neurons. We also observed that eIF2α phosphorylation mediates dendritic loss when mitochondrial dysfunction results from other genetic perturbations. Furthermore, mitochondrial dysfunction induces translation repression in class IV neurons in an eIF2α phosphorylation-dependent manner, suggesting that differential translation attenuation among neuron subtypes is a determinant of preferential vulnerability.",2017,"Hiromi Imamura, Tadashi Uemura, Taiichi Tsuyama, Tadao Usui, Asako Tsubouchi"
"The torso response element binds GAGA and NTF-1/Elf-1, and regulates tailless by relief of repression",8543159,10.1101/gad.9.24.3163,"Modulation of transcription factor activity leading to changes in cell behavior (e.g., differentiation versus proliferation) is one of the critical outcomes of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) stimulation. In the early Drosophila embryo, activation of the torso (tor) RTK at the poles of the embryo activates a phosphorylation cascade that leads to the spatially specific transcription of the tailless (tll) gene. Our analysis of the tor response element (tor-RE) in the tll promoter indicates that the key activity modulated by the tor RTK pathway is a repressor present throughout the embryo. We have mapped the tor-RE to an 11-bp sequence; using this sequence as the basis for protein purification, we have determined that the proteins GAGA and NTF-1 (also known as Elf-1, product of the grainyhead gene) bind to the tor-RE. We demonstrate that NTF-1 can be phosphorylated by MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase), and that tll expression is expanded in embryos lacking maternal NTF-1 activity; these results make NTF-1 a likely target for modulation by the tor RTK pathway in vivo. The data presented here support a model in which activation of the tor RTK at the poles of the embryos leads to inactivation of the repressor and therefore, to transcriptional activation (by activators present throughout the embryo) of the tll gene at the poles of the embryo.",1995,"J D Huang, A J Courey, J A Lengyel, K M Rudolph, G J Liaw, T Dubnicoff"
Comparative biochemical and stress analysis of genetically selected Drosophila strains with different longevities,8641052,10.1002/dvg.1020170407,"We have performed a comparative analysis of the effects of age of reproduction on the biochemical (protein, lipid, and glycogen content) and stress resistance (ability to survive starvation, desiccation, and exogenous paraquat) parameters on 10 sister lines of five different Drosophila strains. Four pairs of these sister lines were selected under different regimens for either early or delayed reproduction; the fifth pair was maintained in a nonselected state and served as the baseline strain to which all others were compared. It is generally accepted that the early regimens give rise to short-lived phenotypes, whereas the delayed regimens give rise to long-lived phenotypes. Our results suggest that a mechanism involving lipid and starvation resistance is not operative in our long-lived strains. In addition, a mechanism involving glycogen content and desiccation resistance is only weakly supported. Finally, there is strong support for a mechanism that gives rise to enhanced paraquat resistance and therefore may involve regulatory changes in the pattern of ADS gene expression. In addition, the 15-day early age of reproduction regimen (M type) shows qualitatively similar responses to that of the late age at reproduction regimen (L type).

The link between short-term and long-term memory,7755904,10.1016/0166-4328(94)00128-3,"Both for Aplysia and Drosophila a key role in the molecular mechanism of learning and memory processes has been assigned to the cAMP cascade. In any learning process a short-time stimulus has to be translated into long-lasting changes. The molecular correlate must be a cascade of biochemical reactions with different kinetics, functionally interlinked and operating in overlapping time ranges. Biochemical studies in Drosophila have led to the suggestion that one of these steps is a proteolytic modification of the regulatory subunits of protein kinase A. A quantitative analysis of the relaxation kinetics of a system of protein kinase A, phosphatases and a calcium-dependent protease can give an image of essential characteristics of learning behaviour in Drosophila.",1995,H C Spatz
Nramp defines a family of membrane proteins,7479731,10.1073/pnas.92.22.10089,"Nramp (natural resistance-associated macrophage protein) is a newly identified family of integral membrane proteins whose biochemical function is unknown. We report on the identification of Nramp homologs from the fly Drosophila melanogaster, the plant Oryza sativa, and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Optimal alignment of protein sequences required insertion of very few gaps and revealed remarkable sequence identity of 28% (yeast), 40% (plant), and 55% (fly) with the mammalian proteins (46%, 58%, and 73% similarity), as well as a common predicted transmembrane topology. This family is defined by a highly conserved hydrophobic core encoding 10 transmembrane segments. Other features of this hydrophobic core include several invariant charged residues, helical periodicity of sequence conservation suggesting conserved and nonconserved faces for several transmembrane helices, a consensus transport signature on the intracytoplasmic face of the membrane, and structural determinants previously described in ion channels. These characteristics suggest that the Nramp polypeptides form part of a group of transporters or channels that act on as yet unidentified substrates.",1995,"W Chia, M Cellier, P Gros, A Belouchi, V Rodrigues, T Kwan, G Privé"

Exposing DD-reared flies to light as embryos or larvae had no effect, while exposing them as adults fully restored normal rhythms in pers and partially restored normal rhythms in the wild type. The percentage of adults with normal rhythms was not significantly different between animals given a 1-h pulse of light as adults and animals given two LD cycles as adults. LD-reared and DD-reared animals given 2 LD cycles were synchronous.

Localization of sequences required for size-specific splicing of a small Drosophila intron in vitro,7473725,10.1006/jmbi.1995.0564,"Many introns in Drosophila and other invertebrates are less than 80 nucleotides in length, too small to be recognized by the vertebrate splicing machinery. Comparison of nuclear splicing extracts from human HeLa and Drosophila Kc cells has revealed species-specificity, consistent with the observed size differences. Here we present additional results with the 68 nucleotide fifth intron of the Drosophila myosin heavy chain gene. As observed with the 74 nucleotide second intron of the Drosophila white gene, the wild-type myosin intron is accurately spliced in a homologous extract, and increasing the size by 16 nucleotides both eliminates splicing in the Drosophila extract and allows accurate splicing in the human extract. In contrast to previous results, however, an upstream cryptic 5' splice site is activated when the wild-type myosin intron is tested in a human HeLa cell nuclear extract, resulting in the removal of a 98 nucleotide intron. The size dependence of splicing in Drosophila extracts is also intron-specific; we noted that a naturally larger (150 nucleotide) intron from the ftz gene is efficiently spliced in Kc cell extracts that do not splice enlarged introns (of 84, 90, 150 or 350 nucleotides) derived from the 74 nucleotide white intron. Here, we have exploited that observation, using a series of hybrid introns to show that a region of 46 nucleotides at the 3' end of the white intron is sufficient to confer the species-specific size effect. At least two sequence elements within this region, yet distinct from previously described branchpoint and pyrimidine tract signals, are required for efficient splicing of small hybrid introns in vitro.",1995,"M Guo, S M Mount"

Multiple response elements in the Sex-lethal early promoter ensure its female-specific expression pattern,7823955,10.1128/mcb.15.2.904,"The choice of sexual identity in somatic tissues of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is determined early in embryogenesis by the X-chromosome-to-autosome (X/A) ratio. The system that signals the X/A ratio selects the sexual development pathway by determining the activity state of the binary switch Sex-lethal (Sxl). In 2X/2A animals, the X/A signalling system turns the Sxl gene on, ultimately activating an RNA-splicing autoregulatory feedback loop which serves to maintain the female state during the remainder of development. In 1X/2A animals, this autoregulatory feedback loop is not activated and the male state is subsequently maintained by the default splicing machinery. In the studies reported here, we have examined how the X/A signalling system controls the initial choice of sexual identity through its action on a special early embryonic Sxl promoter, Sxl-Pe. We show that in the early embryo, the activity of Sxl-Pe is controlled in a highly dose-sensitive fashion by the genes on the X chromosome that function as numerator elements and by genes located on the autosomes that function as denominator elements. Functional dissection of Sxl-Pe indicates that activating the promoter in females requires the cumulative action of multiple numerator genes which appear to exert their effects through reiterated cis-acting target sites in the promoter. Conversely, maintaining the promoter silent in males requires the repressive activities of denominator genes, and at least one of the denominator genes also appears to function through target sequences within the promoter.",1995,"P A Estes, L N Keyes, P Schedl"

The accumulation of tim RNA followed a circadian rhythm, and the phase and period of the tim RNA rhythm were indistinguishable from those that have been reported for per. The tim RNA oscillations were found to be dependent on the presence of PER and TIM proteins, which demonstrates feedback control of tim by a mechanism previously shown to regulate per expression. The cyclic expression of tim appears to dictate the timing of PER protein accumulation and nuclear localization, suggesting that tim promotes circadian rhythms of per and tim transcription by restricting per RNA and PER protein accumulation to separate times of day.",1995,"A Sehgal, M P Myers, M Hunter-Ensor, Y Chen, A Rothenfluh-Hilfiker, M W Young"
Homeotic genes and the regulation and evolution of insect wing number,7723843,10.1038/375058a0,"The evolution of wings catalysed the radiation of insects which make up some 75 per cent of known animals. Fossil evidence suggests that wings evolved from a segment of the leg and that early pterygotes bore wings on all thoracic and abdominal segments. The pterygote body plan subsequently diverged producing orders bearing three, two or just one pair of thoracic wings. We have investigated the role of homeotic genes in pterygote evolution by examining their function in Drosophila wing development and their expression in a primitive apterygote. Wing formation is not promoted by any homeotic gene, but is repressed in different segments by different homeotic genes. We suggest here that wings first arose without any homeotic gene involvement in an ancestor with a homeotic 'groundplan' similar to modern winged insects and that wing formation subsequently fell under the negative control of individual homeotic genes at different stages of pterygote evolution.",1995,"S D Weatherbee, S B Carroll, J A Langeland"

Mosquito ecdysteroid receptor: analysis of the cDNA and expression during vitellogenesis,7711747,10.1016/0965-1748(94)00045-j,"An insect steroid hormone, 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E), plays an important role in regulating egg maturation in mosquitoes. To better understand its role, we cloned the cDNA coding for the putative ecdysteroid receptor from the mosquito, Aedes aegypti (AaEcR). The 4158 bp AaEcR cDNA has an open reading frame of 675 amino acids with 10 potential glycosylation sites and a putative phosphorylation polyserine domain. The AaEcR has a DNA binding domain with two zinc fingers and a ligand binding domain characteristic of members of the steroid hormone receptor superfamily. These AaEcR domains share 97 and 87% identities with the respective domains of the Drosophila ecdysteroid receptor (DmEcR). However, the A/B region of the AaEcR shares 35% identity with that of DmEcR-B1 isoform. The F region, located at the carboxyl-terminal of the AaEcR, has only 9% identity with the corresponding region of DmEcR. Potential nuclear targeting and dimerization signals are also present in the AaEcR sequence. There are three AaEcR transcripts of 4.2 kb, 6 kb and 11 kb in adult mosquitoes. 4.2 kb mRNA is predominantly expressed in female mosquitoes during vitellogenesis. In both the fat body and ovaries of the female mosquito, the level of AaEcR mRNA is high at the previtellogenic period and after the onset of vitellogenesis (6 h post blood meal, PBM).",1995,"M Z Kapitskaya, W L Cho, A S Raikhel"

We show that ventral ectoderm induces mesoderm cells to express nautilus (a MyoD homologue) and to differentiate somatic myofibers, whereas dorsal ectoderm induces mesoderm cells to express visceral and cardiac muscle-specific genes.

Signal transduction by cAMP-dependent protein kinase A in Drosophila limb patterning,7854456,10.1038/373711a0,Interaction between distinctly specified cells in adjacent compartments establishes organizing centres that control growth and specify cell fate in the developing limbs of Drosophila. Localized expression of the secreted Hedgehog protein (Hh) by cells in the posterior compartment induces expression of the secreted signalling molecules decapentaplegic (dpp) or wingless (wg) in nearby anterior cells. wg and dpp in turn organize spatial pattern in the wing and leg imaginal discs. The Hh signal is thought to act by antagonizing the ability of the patched (ptc) gene product to repress wg and dpp expression. Here we present evidence that removing activity of the gene encoding cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A (pka) is functionally equivalent to removing ptc activity or to providing cells with the Hh signal. These findings suggest that cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A is a component of the signal transduction pathway through which Hh and Ptc direct localized expression of dpp (or wg) and establish the compartment boundary organizer.,1995,"F J Diaz-Benjumea, S M Cohen, T Lepage, S M Parkhurst"
Antifreeze protein does not confer cold tolerance to transgenic Drosophila melanogaster,8556858,10.1006/cryo.1995.1054,"Fish antifreeze proteins (AFPs) have been reported by some researchers to prolong the viability of tissues, organs, and embryos under hypothermic conditions, while others have observed no such effect or even AFP-mediated cryotoxicity. We examined the influence of Type III AFP from Atlantic wolffish on cold tolerance in a whole animal model system, transgenic Drosophila. The activity of the AFP, transgenically expressed under the transcriptional control of the female-specific yp1 and yp2 promoters and secreted into fly hemolymph, was confirmed through thermal hysteresis and differential scanning calorimetry measurements as well as through observations of ice crystal morphology. In cold exposure trials, at 0 degrees C and at -7 degrees C, transgenic adult flies of both sexes exhibited greater survival than nontransgenic controls even though the antifreeze was only produced in females. We attribute these observations to the expression of the xanthine dehydrogenase marker gene used to identify transgenics, rather than the production of AFP. Type III AFP therefore appears unable to enhance survival of adult Drosophila under hypothermic conditions.",1995,"P L Davies, B P Duncker, V K Walker, C P Chen"

The suppressor of Hairy-wing protein regulates the tissue-specific expression of the Drosophila gypsy retrotransposon,7705625,,"The gypsy retrotransposon of Drosophila melanogaster causes mutations that show temporal and tissue-specific phenotypes. These mutant phenotypes can be reversed by mutations in su(Hw), a gene that also regulates the transcription of the gypsy element. Gypsy encodes a full-length 7.0-kb RNA that is expressed in the salivary gland precursors and fat body of the embryo, imaginal discs and fat body of larvae, and fat body and ovaries of adult females. The su(Hw)-binding region inserted upstream of the promoter of a lacZ reporter gene can induce beta-galactosidase expression in a subset of the embryonic and larval tissues where gypsy is normally transcribed. This expression is dependent on the presence of a functional su(Hw) product, suggesting that this protein is a positive activator of gypsy transcription. Flies transformed with a construct in which the 5' LTR and leader sequences of gypsy are fused to lacZ show beta-galactosidase expression in all tissues where gypsy is normally expressed, indicating that sequences other than the su(Hw)-binding site are required for proper spatial and temporal expression of gypsy. Mutations in the zinc fingers of su(Hw) affect its ability to bind DNA and to induce transcription of the lacZ reporter gene. Two other structural domains of su(Hw) also play an important role in transcriptional regulation of gypsy. Deletion of the amino-terminal acidic domain results in the loss of lacZ expression in larval fat body and adult ovaries, whereas mutations in the leucine zipper region result in an increase of lacZ expression in larval fat body and a decrease in adult ovaries. These effects might be the result of interactions of su(Hw) with activator and repressor proteins through the acidic and leucine zipper domains to produce the final pattern of tissue-specific expression of gypsy.",1995,"P A Smith, V G Corces"

During embryonic development vvl function is required for the formation of the tracheal tree and in the patterning of the ventral ectoderm. During imaginal development vvl is required for cell proliferation and the differentiation of the wing veins. vvl expression is restricted to the regions where its function is required, and is dependent on the coordinate activities of signalling molecules such as decapentaplegic, wingless and hedgehog. vvl interacts with other genes involved in vein differentiation, including veinlet, thick veins, torpedo, decapentaplegic and Notch suggesting that vvl function may affect several cell-to-cell communication pathways.

A Drosophila gene that encodes a member of the protein disulfide isomerase/phospholipase C-alpha family,7787847,10.1016/0965-1748(95)00001-c,"Screening of a Drosophila genomic DNA library at reduced stringency hybridization conditions using a rat PLC alpha cDNA probe yielded a gene which encodes a member of the protein disulfide isomerase/PLC alpha family. The gene has been localized to band 74C on the left arm of the third chromosome and has been designated dpdi. Northern analysis shows that the dpdi gene encodes a transcript that is 2.3 kb in length and is present throughout development as well as in both heads and bodies of adults. The deduced dpdi protein is 496 amino acids in length and contains two domains exhibiting high similarity to thioredoxin, two regions that are similar to the hormone binding domain of human estrogen receptor, and a sequence of four amino acids (KDEL) at the C-terminus which has been described by others as being responsible for retention of proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. Overall, dpdi contains a higher similarity to rat protein disulfide isomerase (53% identical) than to rat PLC alpha (30% identical).

Position effect variegation in Drosophila is associated with an altered chromatin structure,7758950,10.1101/gad.9.10.1263,"A euchromatic gene placed in the vicinity of heterochromatin by a chromosomal rearrangement generally exhibits position effect variegation (PEV), a clonally inherited pattern showing gene expression in some somatic cells but not in others. The mechanism responsible for this loss of gene expression is investigated here using fly lines carrying a P element containing the Drosophila melanogaster white and hsp26 genes. Following mobilization of the P element, a screen for variegation of white expression recovered inserts at pericentric, telomeric, and fourth chromosome regions. Previously identified suppressors of PEV suppressed white variegation of pericentric and fourth chromosome inserts but not telomeric inserts on the second and third chromosomes. This implies a difference in the mechanism for gene repression at telomeres. Heat shock-induced hsp26 expression was reduced from pericentric and fourth chromosome inserts but not from telomeric inserts. Chromatin structure analysis revealed that the variegating inserts showed a reduction in accessibility to restriction enzyme digestion in the hsp26 regulatory region in isolated nuclei. Micrococcal nuclease digests showed that pericentric inserts were packaged in a more regular nucleosome array than that observed for euchromatic inserts. These data suggest that altered chromatin packaging plays a role in PEV.",1995,"L L Wallrath, S C Elgin"
Apoptosis of the midline glia during Drosophila embryogenesis: a correlation with axon contact,7768193,,"We have examined cell death within lineages in the midline of Drosophila embryos. Approximately 50% of cells within the anterior, middle and posterior midline glial (MGA, MGM and MGP) lineages died by apoptosis after separation of the commissural axon tracts. Glial apoptosis is blocked in embryos deficient for reaper, where greater than wild-type numbers of midline glia (MG) are present after stage 12. Quantitative studies revealed that MG death followed a consistent temporal pattern during embryogenesis. Apoptotic MG were expelled from the central nervous system and were subsequently engulfed by phagocytic haemocytes. MGA and MGM survival was apparently dependent upon proper axonal contact. In embryos mutant for the commissureless gene, a decrease in axon-glia contact correlated with a decrease in MGA and MGM survival and accelerated the time course of MG death. In embryos mutant for the slit gene, MGA and MGM maintained contact with longitudinally and contralaterally projecting axons and MG survival was comparable to that in wild-type embryos. The initial number of MG within individual ventral nerve cord segments was increased by ectopic expression of the rhomboid gene, without changing axon number. Extra MGA and MGM were eliminated from the ventral nerve cord by apoptosis to restore wild-type numbers of midline glia. Ectopic rhomboid expression also shifted MGA and MGM cell death to an earlier stage of embryogenesis. One possible explanation is that axon-glia contact or communication promotes survival of the MG and that MG death may result from a competition for available axon contact.",1995,"J R Jacobs, M J Sonnenfeld"
Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein Regulates Activity-Dependent Membrane Trafficking and Trans-Synaptic Signaling Mediating Synaptic Remodeling,29375303,10.3389/fnmol.2017.00440,"Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the leading monogenic cause of autism and intellectual disability. The disease arises through loss of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), which normally exhibits peak expression levels in early-use critical periods, and is required for activity-dependent synaptic remodeling during this transient developmental window. FMRP canonically binds mRNA to repress protein translation, with targets that regulate cytoskeleton dynamics, membrane trafficking, and trans-synaptic signaling. We focus here on recent advances emerging in these three areas from the Drosophila disease model. In the well-characterized central brain mushroom body (MB) olfactory learning/memory circuit, FMRP is required for activity-dependent synaptic remodeling of projection neurons innervating the MB calyx, with function tightly restricted to an early-use critical period. FMRP loss is phenocopied by conditional removal of FMRP only during this critical period, and rescued by FMRP conditional expression only during this critical period. Consistent with FXS hyperexcitation, FMRP loss defects are phenocopied by heightened sensory experience and targeted optogenetic hyperexcitation during this critical period. FMRP binds mRNA encoding Drosophila ESCRTIII core component Shrub (human CHMP4 homolog) to restrict Shrub translation in an activity-dependent mechanism only during this same critical period. Shrub mediates endosomal membrane trafficking, and perturbing Shrub expression is known to interfere with neuronal process pruning. Consistently, FMRP loss and Shrub overexpression targeted to projection neurons similarly causes endosomal membrane trafficking defects within synaptic boutons, and genetic reduction of Shrub strikingly rescues Drosophila FXS model defects. In parallel work on the well-characterized giant fiber (GF) circuit, FMRP limits iontophoretic dye loading into central interneurons, demonstrating an FMRP role controlling core neuronal properties through the activity-dependent repression of translation. In the well-characterized Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ) model, developmental synaptogenesis and activity-dependent synaptic remodeling both require extracellular matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) enzymes interacting with the heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) glypican dally-like protein (Dlp) to restrict trans-synaptic Wnt signaling, with FXS synaptogenic defects alleviated by both MMP and HSPG reduction. This new mechanistic axis spanning from activity to FMRP to HSPG-dependent MMP regulation modulates activity-dependent synaptogenesis. We discuss future directions for these mechanisms, and intersecting research priorities for FMRP in glial and signaling interactions.",2018,"Kendal Broadie, James C Sears"
Gastric cancer and Hedgehog signaling pathway: emerging new paradigms,29725500,10.18632/genesandcancer.168,"Ever since its initial discovery in Drosophila, hedgehog signaling has been linked to foregut development, The mammalian genome expresses three Hedgehog paralogues, sonic hedgehog (Shh), Indian Hedgehog, and desert hedgehog.

Aberrant activation of hedgehog signaling is associated with a range of pathological consequences including various cancers. Also in gastric cancer, clinical and preclinical data support a role of Hedgehog signaling in neoplastic transformation, and gastrointestinal cancer development, also through cancer stroma interaction. Technological advance are facilitating monitoring Hedgehog signaling broadening options for the more efficient screening of individuals predisposed to eventually developing gastric cancer and targeting Hedgehog signaling may provide opportunities for prophylactic therapy once atrophic gastritis develops. Nevertheless, convincing evidence that Hedgehog antagonists are of clinically useful in the context of gastric cancer is still conspicuously lacking.

We used affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS) to compare flavivirus-host interactions for two viruses (DENV and ZIKV) in two hosts (human and mosquito). Conserved virus-host PPIs revealed that the flavivirus NS5 protein suppresses interferon stimulated genes by inhibiting recruitment of the transcription complex PAF1C and that chemical modulation of SEC61 inhibits DENV and ZIKV replication in human and mosquito cells. Finally, we identified a ZIKV-specific interaction between NS4A and ANKLE2, a gene linked to hereditary microcephaly, and showed that ZIKV NS4A causes microcephaly in Drosophila in an ANKLE2-dependent manner.

Clock-Generated Temporal Codes Determine Synaptic Plasticity to Control Sleep,30318147,10.1016/j.cell.2018.09.016,"Neurons use two main schemes to encode information: rate coding (frequency of firing) and temporal coding (timing or pattern of firing). While the importance of rate coding is well established, it remains controversial whether temporal codes alone are sufficient for controlling behavior. Moreover, the molecular mechanisms underlying the generation of specific temporal codes are enigmatic. Here, we show in Drosophila clock neurons that distinct temporal spike patterns, dissociated from changes in firing rate, encode time-dependent arousal and regulate sleep. From a large-scale genetic screen, we identify the molecular pathways mediating the circadian-dependent changes in ionic flux and spike morphology that rhythmically modulate spike timing. Remarkably, the daytime spiking pattern alone is sufficient to drive plasticity in downstream arousal neurons, leading to increased firing of these cells. These findings demonstrate a causal role for temporal coding in behavior and define a form of synaptic plasticity triggered solely by temporal spike patterns.",2018,"Mark N Wu, Grace Duan, Benjamin Bell, Kechen Zhang, Masashi Tabuchi, Sha Liu, Qili Liu, Joseph D Monaco"
Genetic trade-offs between male reproductive traits in Drosophila melanogaster,30333262,10.1098/rsbl.2018.0474,"In Drosophila melanogaster, males engage in both extensive pre- and post-copulatory competition for the opportunity to mate with females and subsequently sire offspring. The selection pressure for increased male reproductive success has resulted in the evolution of a wide diversity of sexual traits. However, despite strong selection, individuals often exhibit considerable phenotypic variation in the expression of these traits, and it is unclear if any of this variation is owing to underlying genetic trade-offs. Here, using hemiclonal flies, we examine how male reproductive success covaries with their ability to induce long-term stimulation of oogenesis and oviposition in their mates, and how this relationship may change over time. We found that males from hemiclone lines with phenotypes that were more successful in a short-term reproductive 'scramble' environment were less effective at stimulating long-term fecundity in females. Furthermore, we observed that males from hemiclone lines which showed the most improvement over a longer reproductive interaction period also tended to stimulate higher long-term fecundity in females. Together, these results indicate the presence of genetic trade-offs between different male reproductive traits and offer insights into the maintenance of their variation.",2018,"Tristan A F Long, David C S Filice"
Fully-Automatic Synapse Prediction and Validation on a Large Data Set,30420797,10.3389/fncir.2018.00087,"Extracting a connectome from an electron microscopy (EM) data set requires identification of neurons and determination of connections (synapses) between neurons. As manual extraction of this information is very time-consuming, there has been extensive research efforts to automatically segment the neurons to help guide and eventually replace manual tracing. Until recently, there has been comparatively little research on automatic detection of the actual synapses between neurons. This discrepancy can, in part, be attributed to several factors: obtaining neuronal shapes is a prerequisite for the first step in extracting a connectome, manual tracing is much more time-consuming than annotating synapses, and neuronal contact area can be used as a proxy for synapses in determining connections. However, recent research has demonstrated that contact area alone is not a sufficient predictor of a synaptic connection. Moreover, as segmentation improved, we observed that synapse annotation consumes a more significant fraction of overall reconstruction time (upwards of 50% of total effort). This ratio will only get worse as segmentation improves, gating the overall possible speed-up. Therefore, we address this problem by developing algorithms that automatically detect presynaptic neurons and their postsynaptic partners. In particular, presynaptic structures are detected using a U-Net convolutional neural network (CNN), and postsynaptic partners are detected using a multilayer perceptron (MLP) with features conditioned on the local segmentation. This work is novel because it requires minimal amount of training, leverages advances in image segmentation directly, and provides a complete solution for polyadic synapse detection. We further introduce novel metrics to evaluate our algorithm on connectomes of meaningful size. When applied to the output of our method on EM data from Drosphila, these metrics demonstrate that a completely automatic prediction can be used to effectively characterize most of the connectivity correctly.",2018,"Louis K Scheffer, Stephen M Plaza, Gary B Huang"
A Simple Cell-Based Assay for the Detection of Surface Protein Shedding by Rhomboid Proteases,29318543,10.1007/978-1-4939-7595-2_6,"Rhomboids are intramembrane serine proteases that cleave their substrates within or immediately adjacent to their transmembrane domains, a process known as regulated intramembrane proteolysis. In eukaryotes, two main types of rhomboid proteases can be distinguished based on their subcellular localization: mitochondrial rhomboids and secretase-type rhomboids that target the secretory pathway. The latter class can cleave and release the extracellular domain of all epidermal growth factor-like proteins in Drosophila and can liberate epidermal growth factor (EGF) in mammals, in a process known as ectodomain shedding. These released EGFs can then activate the EGF receptor (EGFR). EGFR signaling is crucial for mammalian development and is often deregulated in human cancer. Here we describe a cell-based protocol for detecting the ability of rhomboid proteases to release EGFR ligands into the medium. First, cells are transfected with the corresponding protease- and substrate-expressing vectors; second, cells condition the medium and accumulate shed protein. After this, protein lysates from cells and media are prepared and Western blotting is performed to detect the EGFR ligands that have been released into the medium.",2018,"Angela Moncada-Pazos, Adam Graham Grieve"
Polycomb-Dependent Chromatin Looping Contributes to Gene Silencing during Drosophila Development,30008320,10.1016/j.molcel.2018.05.032,"Interphase chromatin is organized into topologically associating domains (TADs). Within TADs, chromatin looping interactions are formed between DNA regulatory elements, but their functional importance for the establishment of the 3D genome organization and gene regulation during development is unclear. Using high-resolution Hi-C experiments, we analyze higher order 3D chromatin organization during Drosophila embryogenesis and identify active and repressive chromatin loops that are established with different kinetics and depend on distinct factors: Zelda-dependent active loops are formed before the midblastula transition between transcribed genes over long distances. Repressive loops within polycomb domains are formed after the midblastula transition between polycomb response elements by the action of GAGA factor and polycomb proteins. Perturbation of PRE function by CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering affects polycomb domain formation and destabilizes polycomb-mediated silencing. Preventing loop formation without removal of polycomb components also decreases silencing efficiency, suggesting that chromatin architecture can play instructive roles in gene regulation during development.

Heterochromatin protein 1a functions for piRNA biogenesis predominantly from pericentric and telomeric regions in Drosophila,29728561,10.1038/s41467-018-03908-3,"In metazoan germline, Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) provide defence against transposons. Piwi-piRNA complex mediates transcriptional silencing of transposons in nucleus. Heterochromatin protein 1a (HP1a) has been proposed to function downstream of Piwi-piRNA complex in Drosophila. Here we show that HP1a germline knockdown (HP1a-GLKD) leads to a reduction in the total and Piwi-bound piRNAs mapping to clusters and transposons insertions, predominantly in the regions close to telomeres and centromeres, resulting in derepression of a limited number of transposons from these regions. In addition, HP1a-GLKD increases the splicing of transcripts arising from clusters in above regions, suggesting HP1a also functions upstream to piRNA processing. Evolutionarily old transposons enriched in the pericentric regions exhibit significant loss in piRNAs targeting these transposons upon HP1a-GLKD. Our study suggests that HP1a functions to repress transposons in a chromosomal compartmentalised manner.",2018,"Vishweshwaren Sridhar, Ryan Yee Wei Teo, Amit Anand, Toshie Kai, Katsutomo Okamura"
Lifespan extension without fertility reduction following dietary addition of the autophagy activator Torin1 in Drosophila melanogaster,29329306,10.1371/journal.pone.0190105,"Autophagy is a highly conserved mechanism for cellular repair that becomes progressively down-regulated during normal ageing. Hence, manipulations that activate autophagy could increase lifespan. Previous reports show that manipulations to the autophagy pathway can result in longevity extension in yeast, flies, worms and mammals. Under standard nutrition, autophagy is inhibited by the nutrient sensing kinase Target of Rapamycin (TOR). Therefore, manipulations of TOR that increase autophagy may offer a mechanism for extending lifespan. Ideally, such manipulations should be specific and minimise off-target effects, and it is important to discover additional methods for 'clean' lifespan manipulation. Here we report an initial study into the effect of up-regulating autophagy on lifespan and fertility in Drosophila melanogaster by dietary addition of Torin1. Activation of autophagy using this selective TOR inhibitor was associated with significantly increased lifespan in both sexes. Torin1 induced a dose-dependent increase in lifespan in once-mated females. There was no evidence of a trade-off between longevity and fecundity or fertility. Torin1-fed females exhibited significantly elevated fecundity, but also elevated egg infertility, resulting in no net change in overall fertility. This supports the idea that lifespan can be extended without trade-offs in fertility and suggest that Torin1 may be a useful tool with which to pursue anti-ageing research.",2018,"Tom Wileman, Janet S Mason, Tracey Chapman"
Amnesiac Is Required in the Adult Mushroom Body for Memory Formation,30201766,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0876-18.2018,"It was proposed that the Drosophila amnesiac gene (amn) is required for consolidation of aversive memory in the dorsal paired medial (DPM) neurons, a pair of large neurons that broadly innervate the mushroom bodies (MB), the fly center for olfactory learning and memory (Waddell et al., 2000). Yet, a conditional analysis showed that it was not possible to rescue the memory deficit of amnX8 null mutant flies when amn expression was restored only in the adult (DeZazzo et al., 1999), which led the authors to suggest that amn might be involved in the development of brain structures that normally promote adult olfactory memory. To further investigate temporal and spatial requirements of Amnesiac (AMN) peptide in memory, we used RNA interference in combination with conditional drivers. Experiments were conducted either in both sexes, or in either sexes. Our data show that acute modulation of amn expression in adult DPM neurons does not impact memory. We further show that amn expression is required for normal development of DPM neurons. Detailed enhancer trap analyses suggest that amn transcription unit contains two distinct enhancers, one specific of DPM neurons, and the other specific of α/β MB neurons. This prompted us to investigate extensively the role of AMN in the adult MB. Together, our results demonstrate that amn is acutely required in adult α/β MB neurons for middle-term and long-term memory. The data thus establish that amn plays two distinct roles. Its expression is required in DPM neurons for their development, and in adult MB for olfactory memory.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The Drosophila amnesiac gene encodes a neuropeptide whose expression was proposed to be required for consolidation of aversive memory in the dorsal paired medial (DPM) neurons, a pair of large neurons that broadly innervate the mushroom bodies (MB), the olfactory memory center.

This work leads to a complete reassessment of the role of amnesiac in brain development and memory. We show that amnesiac is required for two distinct processes: for normal development of DPM neurons, and in adult MB for memory.",2018,"Oriane Turrel, Thomas Preat, Valérie Goguel"
Localization and translation control of slam in Drosophila cellularization,30211628,10.1080/19336934.2018.1520574,"In this extra view, we comment on our recent work concerning the mRNA localization of the gene slow as molasses (slam). slam is a gene essential for the polarized invagination of the plasma membrane and separation of basal and lateral cortical domains during cellularization as well as for germ cell migration in later embryogenesis. We have demonstrated an intimate relationship between slam RNA and its encoded protein. Slam RNA co-localizes and forms a complex with its encoded protein. Slam mRNA localization not only is required for reaching full levels of functional Slam protein but also depends on Slam protein. The translation of slam mRNA is subject to tight spatio-temporal regulation leading to a rapid accumulation of Slam protein and zygotic slam RNA at the furrow canal. In this extra view, we first discuss the mechanism controlling localization and translation of slam RNA. In addition, we document in detail the maternal and zygotic expression of slam RNA and protein and provide data for a function in membrane stabilization. Furthermore, we mapped the region of Slam protein mediating cortical localization in cultured cells.",2018,"Jörg Großhans, Shuling Yan"
Monoubiquitination of ASXLs controls the deubiquitinase activity of the tumor suppressor BAP1,30349006,10.1038/s41467-018-06854-2,"The tumor suppressor and deubiquitinase (DUB) BAP1 and its Drosophila ortholog Calypso assemble DUB complexes with the transcription regulators Additional sex combs-like (ASXL1, ASXL2, ASXL3) and Asx respectively. ASXLs and Asx use their DEUBiquitinase ADaptor (DEUBAD) domain to stimulate BAP1/Calypso DUB activity. Here we report that monoubiquitination of the DEUBAD is a general feature of ASXLs and Asx. BAP1 promotes DEUBAD monoubiquitination resulting in an increased stability of ASXL2, which in turn stimulates BAP1 DUB activity. ASXL2 monoubiquitination is directly catalyzed by UBE2E family of Ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes and regulates mammalian cell proliferation. Remarkably, Calypso also regulates Asx monoubiquitination and transgenic flies expressing monoubiquitination-defective Asx mutant exhibit developmental defects.

Ribosomal protein L10A and signaling pathway,29953919,10.1016/j.gene.2018.06.081,"Ribosome: machinery in control of messenger RNA's (mRNAs) and several ribosomal proteins are in the small and large subunit of the ribosome. Various aspects of ribosomal proteins have related to cell growth, cell cycle, and diseases. Ribosomal protein L10A (RpL10A) in shrimp and fruit fly has been demonstrated to play a role in oogenesis. Interestingly, deletion RpL10A gene (RpL10Ab-/-) germ line clone of the fruit fly showed a loss of follicle cells surrounding the egg chamber, but nurse cells appeared normal. This phenotype is reminiscent of insulin receptor mutants (InR-/-). In contrast, over-expression of RpL10A in the eyes of the fruit flies resulted in abnormal ommatidia with a loss of red pigment in the center of the eyes. In this study, the abnormal rearrangements of nuclei and lack of cell membranes in those eyes were demonstrated. Furthermore, the expression of InR gene and the InR protein were extensively increased as determined by real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry, respectively. In addition, some insulin signaling mediators were also detected. The Akt and FOXO proteins were highly phosphorylated in the RpL10A over-expressed mutant.

Enhanced survival of Drosophila Akt1 hypomorphs during amino-acid starvation requires foxo,26783834,10.1139/gen-2015-0113,"Disordered eating includes any pattern of irregular eating that may lead to either extreme weight loss or obesity. The conserved insulin receptor signalling pathway acts to regulate energy balance and nutrient intake, and its central component Akt1 and endpoint effector foxo are pivotal for survival during nutritional stress. Recently generated Akt1 hypomorphic mutant lines exhibit a moderate decrease in lifespan when aged upon standard media, yet show a considerable increase in survival upon amino-acid starvation media. While the loss of foxo function significantly reduces the survival response to amino-acid starvation, a combination of these Akt1 hypomorphs and a null foxo mutation reveal a synergystic and severe reduction in lifespan upon standard media, and an epistatic relationship when undergoing amino-acid starvation. Evaluation of survivorship upon amino-acid starvation media of these double mutants indicate a phenotype similar to the original foxo mutant demonstrating the role of foxo in this Akt1 phenotype. These results indicate that the subtle manipulation of foxo through Akt1 can enhance survival during adverse nutrient conditions to model the ability of individuals to tolerate nutrient deprivation.

Calmodulin Affects Sensitization of Drosophila melanogaster Odorant Receptors,26903813,10.3389/fncel.2016.00028,"Flying insects have developed a remarkably sensitive olfactory system to detect faint and turbulent odor traces. This ability is linked to the olfactory receptors class of odorant receptors (ORs), occurring exclusively in winged insects. ORs form heteromeric complexes of an odorant specific receptor protein (OrX) and a highly conserved co-receptor protein (Orco). The ORs form ligand gated ion channels that are tuned by intracellular signaling systems. Repetitive subthreshold odor stimulation of olfactory sensory neurons sensitizes insect ORs. This OR sensitization process requires Orco activity. In the present study we first asked whether OR sensitization can be monitored with heterologously expressed OR proteins. Using electrophysiological and calcium imaging methods we demonstrate that D. melanogaster OR proteins expressed in CHO cells show sensitization upon repeated weak stimulation. This was found for OR channels formed by Orco as well as by Or22a or Or56a and Orco. Moreover, we show that inhibition of calmodulin (CaM) action on OR proteins, expressed in CHO cells, abolishes any sensitization. Finally, we investigated the sensitization phenomenon using an ex vivo preparation of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) expressing Or22a inside the fly's antenna. Using calcium imaging, we observed sensitization in the dendrites as well as in the soma. Inhibition of calmodulin with W7 disrupted the sensitization within the outer dendritic shaft, whereas the sensitization remained in the other OSN compartments. Taken together, our results suggest that CaM action is involved in sensitizing the OR complex and that this mechanisms accounts for the sensitization in the outer dendrites, whereas further mechanisms contribute to the sensitization observed in the other OSN compartments. The use of heterologously expressed OR proteins appears to be suitable for further investigations on the mechanistic basis of OR sensitization, while investigations on native neurons are required to study the presently unknown additional mechanisms involved in OSN sensitization.",2016,"Fabio Miazzi, Vardanush Sargsyan, Dieter Wicher, Latha Mukunda, Bill S Hansson"
The mitochondrial outer membrane protein MDI promotes local protein synthesis and mtDNA replication,27053724,10.15252/embj.201592994,"Early embryonic development features rapid nuclear DNA replication cycles, but lacks mtDNA replication. To meet the high-energy demands of embryogenesis, mature oocytes are furnished with vast amounts of mitochondria and mtDNA However, the cellular machinery driving massive mtDNA replication in ovaries remains unknown. Here, we describe a Drosophila AKAP protein, MDI that recruits a translation stimulator, La-related protein (Larp), to the mitochondrial outer membrane in ovaries. The MDI-Larp complex promotes the synthesis of a subset of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins by cytosolic ribosomes on the mitochondrial surface. MDI-Larp's targets include mtDNA replication factors, mitochondrial ribosomal proteins, and electron-transport chain subunits. Lack of MDI abolishes mtDNA replication in ovaries, which leads to mtDNA deficiency in mature eggs. Targeting Larp to the mitochondrial outer membrane independently of MDI restores local protein synthesis and rescues the phenotypes of mdi mutant flies. Our work suggests that a selective translational boost by the MDI-Larp complex on the outer mitochondrial membrane might be essential for mtDNA replication and mitochondrial biogenesis during oogenesis.",2016,"Marjan Gucek, Yi Zhang, Yong Chen, Hong Xu"

Evolutionary implications of mitochondrial genetic variation: mitochondrial genetic effects on OXPHOS respiration and mitochondrial quantity change with age and sex in fruit flies,26728607,10.1111/jeb.12822,"The ancient acquisition of the mitochondrion into the ancestor of modern-day eukaryotes is thought to have been pivotal in facilitating the evolution of complex life. Mitochondria retain their own diminutive genome, with mitochondrial genes encoding core subunits involved in oxidative phosphorylation. Traditionally, it was assumed that there was little scope for genetic variation to accumulate and be maintained within the mitochondrial genome. However, in the past decade, mitochondrial genetic variation has been routinely tied to the expression of life-history traits such as fertility, development and longevity. To examine whether these broad-scale effects on life-history trait expression might ultimately find their root in mitochondrially mediated effects on core bioenergetic function, we measured the effects of genetic variation across twelve different mitochondrial haplotypes on respiratory capacity and mitochondrial quantity in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. We used strains of flies that differed only in their mitochondrial haplotype, and tested each sex separately at two different adult ages. Mitochondrial haplotypes affected both respiratory capacity and mitochondrial quantity. However, these effects were highly context-dependent, with the genetic effects contingent on both the sex and the age of the flies. These sex- and age-specific genetic effects are likely to resonate across the entire organismal life-history, providing insights into how mitochondrial genetic variation may contribute to sex-specific trajectories of life-history evolution.",2016,"M F Camus, G Côté, J N Wolff, D K Dowling, N Pichaud, P U Blier"
Anatomical Reconstruction and Functional Imaging Reveal an Ordered Array of Skylight Polarization Detectors in Drosophila,27170135,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0310-16.2016,"Many insects exploit skylight polarization as a compass cue for orientation and navigation. In the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, photoreceptors R7 and R8 in the dorsal rim area (DRA) of the compound eye are specialized to detect the electric vector (e-vector) of linearly polarized light. These photoreceptors are arranged in stacked pairs with identical fields of view and spectral sensitivities, but mutually orthogonal microvillar orientations. As in larger flies, we found that the microvillar orientation of the distal photoreceptor R7 changes in a fan-like fashion along the DRA. This anatomical arrangement suggests that the DRA constitutes a detector for skylight polarization, in which different e-vectors maximally excite different positions in the array. To test our hypothesis, we measured responses to polarized light of varying e-vector angles in the terminals of R7/8 cells using genetically encoded calcium indicators. Our data confirm a progression of preferred e-vector angles from anterior to posterior in the DRA, and a strict orthogonality between the e-vector preferences of paired R7/8 cells. We observed decreased activity in photoreceptors in response to flashes of light polarized orthogonally to their preferred e-vector angle, suggesting reciprocal inhibition between photoreceptors in the same medullar column, which may serve to increase polarization contrast. Together, our results indicate that the polarization-vision system relies on a spatial map of preferred e-vector angles at the earliest stage of sensory processing. Significance statement: The fly's visual system is an influential model system for studying neural computation, and much is known about its anatomy, physiology, and development. The circuits underlying motion processing have received the most attention, but researchers are increasingly investigating other functions, such as color perception and object recognition. In this work, we investigate the early neural processing of a somewhat exotic sense, called polarization vision. Because skylight is polarized in an orientation that is rigidly determined by the position of the sun, this cue provides compass information. Behavioral experiments have shown that many species use the polarization pattern in the sky to direct locomotion.

Pharmacological or Genetic Activation of Hsp70 Protects against Loss of Parkin Function,26886023,10.1159/000443668,"Mutations of parkin are a prevalent genetic contributor to familial Parkinson's disease (PD). As a key regulator of protein and mitochondrial homeostasis, parkin plays a pivotal role in maintaining dopaminergic neuronal survival. However, whereas Drosophila parkin null mutants exhibit prominent parkinsonian features, parkin-deficient mice generally lack an overt phenotype. Here, we found that the expression of Hsp70 along with several other members of the chaperone family is elevated in parkin null mice, suggesting a possible compensatory mechanism for the loss of parkin function in these mice that could have masked their phenotype. Supporting this, we demonstrate that the enhancement of chaperone function induced either pharmacologically via 17-AAG treatment or genetically via Hsp70 overexpression can protect cells against proteolytic and mitochondrial stress in a manner that is similar to that brought about by parkin overexpression. Importantly, we further showed that enhanced chaperone activity can ameliorate the pathological phenotypes in Drosophila parkin null mutants, which suggests the ability of chaperones to phenocopy parkin function. Taken together, our results suggest that Hsp members may act as compensatory factors for parkin loss of function and that the exploitation of these factors may be of potential therapeutic value.",2016,"Eugenia T E Hong, Henry Basil Adeline, Bing-Han Chai, Cheng-Wu Zhang, Chee-Hoe Ng, Kah-Leong Lim"

Their molecular functions were further screened for transmembrane ion transporter, calcium or zinc ion binder. Among these, 11 candidate proteins were shortlisted in NaOx diet and 16 proteins in EG diet.

Ancient Anxiety Pathways Influence Drosophila Defense Behaviors,27020741,10.1016/j.cub.2016.02.031,"Anxiety helps us anticipate and assess potential danger in ambiguous situations [1-3]; however, the anxiety disorders are the most prevalent class of psychiatric illness [4-6].

Anxiety research makes wide use of three rodent behavioral assays-elevated plus maze, open field, and light/dark box-that present a choice between sheltered and exposed regions [11]. Exposure avoidance in anxiety-related defense behaviors was confirmed to be a correlate of rodent anxiety by treatment with known anxiety-altering agents [12-14] and is now used to characterize anxiety systems. Modeling anxiety with a small neurogenetic animal would further aid the elucidation of its neuronal and molecular bases. Drosophila neurogenetics research has elucidated the mechanisms of fundamental behaviors and implicated genes that are often orthologous across species. In an enclosed arena, flies stay close to the walls during spontaneous locomotion [15, 16], a behavior proposed to be related to anxiety [17]. We tested this hypothesis with manipulations of the GABA receptor, serotonin signaling, and stress. The effects of these interventions were strikingly concordant with rodent anxiety, verifying that these behaviors report on an anxiety-like state.

A Simple One-step Dissection Protocol for Whole-mount Preparation of Adult Drosophila Brains,27929474,10.3791/55128,"There is an increasing interest in using Drosophila to model human brain degenerative diseases, map neuronal circuitries in adult brains, and study the molecular and cellular basis of higher brain functions. A whole-mount preparation of adult brains with well-preserved morphology is critical for such whole brain-based studies, but can be technically challenging and time-consuming. This protocol describes an easy-to-learn, one-step dissection approach of an adult fly head in less than 10 s, while keeping the intact brain attached to the rest of the body to facilitate subsequent processing steps. The procedure helps remove most of the eye and tracheal tissues normally associated with the brain that can interfere with the later imaging step, and also places less demand on the quality of the dissecting forceps. Additionally, we describe a simple method that allows convenient flipping of the mounted brain samples on a coverslip, which is important for imaging both sides of the brains with similar signal intensity and quality. As an example of the protocol, we present an analysis of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in adult brains of WT (w1118) flies. The high efficacy of the dissection method makes it particularly useful for large-scale adult brain-based studies in Drosophila.",2016,"Antonio J Tito, Mian Jiang, Sheng Zhang, Shebna Cheema"
Cancer Prevention and Health Benefices of Traditionally Consumed Borago officinalis Plants,26797631,10.3390/nu8010048,"Nowadays, healthy eating is increasing the demand of functional foods by societies as sources of bioactive products with healthy qualities. For this reason, we tested the safety of the consumption of Borago officinalis L. and its main phenolic components as well as the possibility of its use as a nutraceutical plant to help in cancer prevention. The in vivo Drosophila Somatic Mutation and Recombination Test (SMART) and in vitro HL-60 human cell systems were performed, as well-recognized methods for testing genotoxicity/cytotoxicity of bioactive compounds and plant products. B. officinalis and the tested compounds possess antigenotoxic activity. Moreover, B. officinalis wild type cultivar exerts the most antigenotoxic values. Cytotoxic effect was probed for both cultivars with IC50 values of 0.49 and 0.28 mg · mL(-1) for wild type and cultivated plants respectively, as well as their constituent rosmarinic acid and the assayed phenolic mixture (IC50 = 0.07 and 0.04 mM respectively). B. officinalis exerts DNA protection and anticarcinogenic effects as do its component rosmarinic acid and the mixture of the main phenolics presented in the plant. In conclusion, the results showed that B. officinalis may represent a high value plant for pleiotropic uses and support its consumption as a nutraceutical plant.",2016,"Ángeles Alonso-Moraga, Antonio de Haro-Bailón, María-Dolores Lozano-Baena, Andrés Muñoz-Serrano, Inmaculada Tasset"
Ultra-low activities of a common radioisotope for permission-free tracking of a drosophilid fly in its natural habitat,27812000,10.1038/srep36506,"Knowledge of a species' ecology, including its movement in time and space, is key for many questions in biology and conservation. While numerous tools for tracking larger animals are available, millimetre-sized insects are averse to standard tracking and labelling procedures. Here, we evaluated the applicability of ultra-low, permission-exempt activities of the metastable isomer of the radionuclide Technetium-99 for labelling and field detection of the mountain fly Drosophila nigrosparsa. We demonstrate that an activity of less than 10 MBq is sufficient to label dozens of flies and detect single individuals using standard radiation protection monitors.

Intracellular signals direct integrin localization to sites of function in embryonic muscles,8698816,10.1083/jcb.134.1.217,"In the Drosophila embryo, the alphaPS2betaPS integrin heterodimer is localized tightly at the termini of the multinucleate muscles where they attach to the alphaPS1betaPS-containing epidermal tendon cells. Here we examine the basis for alphaPS2betaPS integrin subcellular localization. We show that the betaPS cytoplasmic tail is sufficient to direct the localization of a heterologous transmembrane protein, CD2, to the muscle termini in vivo. This localization does not occur via an association with structures set up by the endogenous betaPS integrins, since it can occur even in the absence of the betaPS protein. Furthermore, the subcellular localization of the alphaPS2betaPS integrin is not dependent on any other interactions between the muscles and the tendon cells. In embryos that lack the segmental tendon cells, due to a mutation removing the related segment polarity genes engrailed and invected, alphaPS2betaPS is still localized to the muscle termini even though the ventral longitudinal muscles are not attached to the epidermis, but instead are attached end to end. Thus the alphaPS2betaPS integrin can be localized by an intracellular mechanism within the muscles. Our results challenge the view that the transmission of signals from the extracellular environment via integrins is required for the organization of the cytoskeleton and the resultant cellular polarity.",1996,"M D Martin-Bermudo, N H Brown"
Replacement of the glycoinositol phospholipid anchor of Drosophila acetylcholinesterase with a transmembrane domain does not alter sorting in neurons and epithelia but results in behavioral defects,8730103,10.1091/mbc.7.4.613,"Drosophila has a single glycoinositol phospholipid (GPI)-anchored form of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) encoded by the Ace locus. To assess the role that GPI plays in the physiology, of AChE, we have replaced the wild-type GPI-AChE with a chimeric transmembrane form (TM-AChE) in the nervous system of the fly. Ace null alleles provided a genetic background completely lacking in endogenous GPI-AChE, and Ace minigene P transposon constructs were used to express both GPI- and TM-AChE forms in the tissues where AChE is normally expressed. Control experiments with the GPI-AChE minigene demonstrated a threshold between 9 and 12% of normal AChE activity for adult viability. Ace mutant flies were rescued by GPI-AChE minigene lines that expressed 12-40% of normal activity and were essentially unchanged from wild-type flies in behavior. TM-AChE minigene lines were able to rescue Ace null alleles, although with a slightly higher threshold than that for GPI-AChE. Although rescued flies expressing GPI-AChE at a level of 12% of normal activity were viable, flies expressing 13-16% of normal activity from the TM-AChE transgene died shortly after eclosion. Flies expressing TM-AChE at about 30% of normal levels were essentially unchanged from wild-type flies in gross behavior but had a reduced lifespan secondary to subtle coordination defects. These flies also showed reduced locomotor activity and performed poorly in a grooming assay. However, light level and electron microscopic immunocytochemistry showed no differences in the localization of GPI- and TM-AChE. Furthermore, endogenous and ectopic-induced expression of both AChEs in epithelial tissues of the adult and embryo, respectively, showed that they were sorted identically. Most epithelial cells sorted GPI- and TM-AChE to the apical surface, but cuticle-secreting epithelia sorted both proteins basolaterally. Our data suggest that rather than having a primary role in protein sorting, the GPI anchor or AChE plays some other more subtle cellular role in neuronal physiology.",1996,"J P Incardona, T L Rosenberry"
Gene regulation in the Drosophila embryo,8735281,10.1098/rstb.1996.0057,"Pattern formation in Drosophila depends on hierarchical interactions between the maternal and zygotic gene activities which subdivide the embryo into increasingly smaller metameric units along the anterior posterior axis. Here we describe those genes that encode the transcription factors which control precisely the expression of subordinate transcription factors in time and space. This regulation operates through the protein-protein interactions between transcription factors bound to the cis-acting enhancers, which eventually determine the frequency of transcription initiation by polymerase II. Our data show that taking into account the multiple transcriptional activators and repressors that bind to a typical enhancer element, it is likely that the regulation of gene expression in a given cell is defined by their concentration-dependent interplay which directs target gene expression in a position-dependent fashion.",1996,"R Rivera-Pomar, H Jäckle, F Sauer, M Hoch"
Cloning of CDP-diacylglycerol synthase from a human neuronal cell line,8863531,10.1046/j.1471-4159.1996.67052200.x,"A critical step in the supply of substrate for the phosphoinositide signal transduction pathway is the formation of the liponucleotide intermediate, CDP-diacylglycerol, catalyzed by CDP-diacylglycerol synthase. Further insight into the regulation of phosphoinositide biosynthesis was sought by cloning of the gene for the vertebrate enzyme. Sequence of the corresponding gene from Drosophila was used to prepare a probe for screening of a human neuronal cell cDNA library. A cDNA was isolated with a predicted open reading frame of 1,332 bases, encoding a protein of 51 kDa. The amino acid sequence showed 50% identity (75% similarity) to that of Drosophila eye CDP-diacylglycerol synthase and substantial similarity to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli homologues. Northern blot analysis, with human cDNA riboprobes, suggested that the corresponding mRNA was expressed in all human tissues examined. Expression of the human cDNA in COS cells resulted in a more than fourfold increase in CDP-diacylglycerol synthase activity.

A maternal requirement for glutamine synthetase I for the mitotic cycles of syncytial Drosophila embryos,8937983,,"We describe the maternal effect phenotype of a hypomorphic mutation in the Drosophila gene for glutamine synthetase I (GSI). The extent of development of embryos derived from homozygous mutant females is variable, although most mutant embryos fail to survive past germband elongation and none develop into larvae. These embryos are characterised by an increase in the number of yolk-like nuclei following nuclear migration to the cortex. These nuclei appear to fall into the interior of the embryo from the cortex at blastoderm. As they do so, the majority continue to show association with PCNA in synchrony with nuclei at the cortex, suggesting some continuity of the synchrony of DNA replication. However, the occurrence of nuclei that have lost cell cycle synchrony with their neighbours is not uncommon. Immunostaining of mutant embryos revealed a range of mitotic defects, ultimately resulting in nuclear fusion events, division failure or other mitotic abnormalities. A high proportion of these mitotic figures show chromatin bridging at anaphase and telophase consistent with progression through mitosis in the presence of incompletely replicated DNA. GSI is responsible for the ATP-dependent amination of glutamate to produce glutamine, which is required in the formation of amino acids, purines and pyrimidines. We discuss how the loss of glutamine could depress both protein and DNA synthesis and lead to a variety of mitotic defects in this embryonic system that lacks certain checkpoint controls.",1996,"D M Glover, L M Frenz"
Studies on the structure of ocellar photoreceptor cells of Drosophila melanogaster with special reference to subrhabdomeric cisternae,8601298,10.1007/s004410050568,"We studied the structure of ocellar photoreceptor cells of Drosophila melanogaster, particularly the subrhabdomeric cisternae which our previous studies have shown to be essential structures for turnover of photoreceptive membranes in compound eyes. Each ocellus contained elongated photoreceptor cells with rhabdomeres positioned distally. In the subrhabdomeric regions, endocytotic invaginations were frequently observed, suggesting active turnover of photoreceptive membranes. In the vicinity of the photoreceptive microvilli, membranous structures similar to the subrhabdomeric cisternae in compound eyes were observed. These membranous structures were immunopositive for the rdgB protein, a phosphatidylinositol transfer protein that is localized to the subrhabdomeric cisternae in compound eyes. The ocellar photoreceptor cells of the retinal degeneration mutants (rdgA,B) were also studied. In these mutants, retinal degeneration has been reported to start, in compound eyes, with the disappearance of the subrhabdomeric cisternae. We found that the ocellar subrhabdomeric cisternae also disappear during the initial stage of retinal degeneration. From these observations, we conclude that the mechanism of photoreceptive membrane turnover in ocellar photoreceptor cells involves the rdgB and probably the rdgA proteins which are associated with subrhabdomeric cisternae, as is the case for photoreceptive membrane turnover in compound eyes.",1996,"K Hirosawa, E Suzuki, C S Yoon"
Genetic modification of heterochromatic association and nuclear organization in Drosophila,8632827,10.1038/381529a0,"Heterochromatin is the highly compact, usually pericentromeric, region of eukaryotic chromosomes. Unlike the more gene-rich euchromatin, heterochromatin remains condensed during interphase, when it is sequestered to the periphery of the nucleus. Here we show, by using fluorescent in situ hybridization to interphase diploid nuclei of Drosophila, that the insertion of heterochromatin into a euchromatic gene, which results in position-effect variegation (PEV), also causes the aberrant association of the gene and its homologous copy with heterochromatin. In correlation with the gene's mutant variegating phenotype, the cytological association of the heterochromatic region is affected by chromosomal distance from heterochromatin and by genic modifiers of PEV. Proteins that are thought to be involved in the formation of heterochromatin can therefore influence the interphase nuclear position of a chromosomal region. This suggests that heterochromatin and proteins involved in its formation provide a structural framework for the interphase nucleus.",1996,"A K Csink, S Henikoff"

Chromosomally male flies produced molecules that were partly or totally feminized, depending upon the strain. The influence on male courtship behaviour of live flies producing different mixtures of male and female pheromones was measured. The intensity of the male response was mainly a function of the stimulatory effect of 7, 11 nonacosadiene and 7, 11 heptacosadiene, two female pheromones, combined with the inhibiting effect of 7-tricosene, the male predominant molecule. These compounds were effective at very different doses. The influence of secondary molecules on male behaviours was also evaluated.

A similar sequence is found up-stream of opsin genes, from humans to Drosophila, as well as many other photoreceptor-specific genes. The function of the Ret 1 element was tested both in vitro and in two sets of transgenic mice. A mutated Ret 1 element did not bind retinal nuclear proteins in vitro. The same mutations in an otherwise normal 1.9-kb rat opsin promoter failed to drive expression of a lacZ reporter gene in nine of 12 lines. In the three other lines, expression in photoreceptors was very faint. Four tandem copies of the Ret 1 element maintained the Ret 1 binding specificity in vitro and were able to direct expression of a lacZ transgene in photoreceptors of all nine mouse lines obtained. In two lines, expression was also detected in the ganglion cell layer and the ciliary epithelium. In three lines, a characteristic pattern of expression was found in the nervous system in addition to the normal retinal expression. These results indicate that Ret 1 can and is necessary to drive gene expression in rod photoreceptors.

THERMAL EVOLUTION OF EGG SIZE IN DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER,28565673,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1996.tb03621.x,"We measured the size of eggs produced by populations of Drosophila melanogaster that had been collected along latitudinal gradients in different continents or that had undergone several years of culture at different temperatures in the laboratory. Australian and South American populations from higher latitudes produced larger eggs when all were compared at a standard temperature. Laboratory populations that had been evolving at 16.5°C produced larger eggs than populations that had evolved at 25°C or 29°C, suggesting that temperature may be an important selective agent in producing the latitudinal clines. Flies from laboratory populations produced larger eggs at an experimental temperature of 16.5°C than at 25°C, and there was no indication of genotype-environment interaction for egg size. Evolution of egg size in response to temperature cannot be accounted for by differences in adult body size between populations.

Evolution of Antennapedia-class homeobox genes,8770606,,"Antennapedia (Antp)-class homeobox genes are involved in the determination of pattern formation along the anterior-posterior axis of the animal embryo. A phylogenetic analysis of Antp-class homeodomains of the nematode, Drosophila, amphioxus, mouse, and human indicates that the 13 cognate group genes of this gene family can be divided into two major groups, i.e., groups I and II. Group I genes can further be divided into subgroups A (cognate groups 1-2), B (cognate group 3), and C (cognate groups 4-8), and group II genes can be divided into subgroups D (cognate groups 9-10) and E (cognate groups 11-13), though this classification is somewhat ambiguous. Evolutionary distances among different amino acid sequences suggest that the divergence between group I and group II genes occurred approximately 1000 million years (MY) ago, and the five different subgroups were formed by approximately 600 MY ago, probably before the divergence of Pseudocoelomates (e.g., nematodes) and Coelomates (e.g., insects and chordates).

Cell-specific heat-shock induction of Hsp23 in the eye of Drosophila melanogaster,9222588,10.1379/1466-1268(1996)001<0040:cshsio>2.3.co;2,"The expression of two small heat shock proteins (sHsp), Hsp23 and Hsp27, was examined by immunological approaches in the eye of Drosophila melanogaster. Neither Hsp23 nor Hsp27 is detectable in unstressed (23 degrees C) eyes but both proteins are induced by heat shock (35 degrees C). In response to heat stress, Hsp27 is expressed in all cells of the ommatidium including the cone, pigment and photoreceptor cells. However, the heat-induced expression of Hsp23 is restricted to a single cell type of the ommatidium, the cone cells, suggesting that Hsp23 is regulated by specific mechanisms acting to inhibit the expression of this polypeptide in some ommatidial cells. The cell-specific induction of Hsp23 under stress conditions does not seem to be regulated by the Drosophila melanogaster heat shock transcriptional factor (DmHSF). In both unstressed and stressed conditions, DmHSF is detected in all the different types of ommatidial cells where it is found associated with the nucleus. These observations suggest that factors, other than the heat shock transcriptional factor, are involved in regulating the expression of the hsp23 gene under stress conditions.",1996,"R Marin, M Demers, R M Tanguay"

Repression and turnover pattern fushi tarazu RNA in the early Drosophila embryo,3096577,10.1016/0092-8674(86)90517-9,"Embryonic expression of transcripts from the Drosophila gene fushi tarazu (ftz) progresses through a series of spatial patterns, culminating in a seven-banded pattern at the cellular blastoderm stage. We studied the generation of this pattern using inhibitors of RNA synthesis (alpha-amanitin) and protein synthesis (cycloheximide). Injections of alpha-amanitin revealed that ftz RNA turns over extremely rapidly in the embryo, and we think that this may be essential to effect rapid changes in ftz RNA patterns. Injections of cycloheximide added to the normal domains of ftz expression, creating novel expression patterns that were dependent on the time of injection. These novel patterns suggest that two superimposed systems of repression establish the normal, seven-banded pattern of ftz expression.

Transcription was studied in vitro from templates carrying YPI or YPII promoter regions separately. We have successively deleted intergenic DNA upstream of the YPI or the YPII transcription start site and have assayed the dependence of transcription efficiency an template concentration. The results indicate that in vitro YPI and YPII transcript synthesis is controlled by separate cis-acting DNA sequence elements, which are located between 86 and 159 base pairs upstream of the YPI transcription start site and between 161 and 341 base pairs upstream of the YPII transcription start site.

The ratio of induced recessive lethals to ring-X loss has prognostic value in terms of functionality of chemical mutagens in Drosophila melanogaster,2458528,10.1016/0027-5107(88)90108-x,"For 25 mutagens in Drosophila the ratio was determined between the induction of sex-linked recessive lethals (SLRL) and the induction of ring-X loss in male adults. For small monofunctional alkylating agents this ratio increases with decreasing s-value from 1.8 for methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) to 27 for ethylnitrosourea (ENU). For multifunctional cross-linking agents, however, the ratio varies within relatively narrow limits, ranging from 0.15 for cisplatin to 0.07 for tris-(1-aziridinyl)phosphineoxide (TEPA), while for most agents the ratio is around 0.12. The number of reactive groups seems to be of minor importance for compounds with more than one functionality as bi- and tri-functional agents show similar ratios. The systemic difference in the ratios between mono- and multi-functional agents suggests that different mechanisms are involved in the induction of SLRLs and ring-X loss. For ethyleneimine (EI) and ethyleneoxide (EO) low ratios of 0.32 and 0.60 respectively were observed which do not correlate with their s-values. An alternative chromosome-breaking mechanism may be responsible for this deviation, possibly alkylation of the phosphate backbone of DNA, followed by an intramolecular displacement of one of the deoxyribose groups by the beta-amino or the beta-hydroxy group. It is felt that the considerable difference between the ratios for monofunctional and multifunctional agents may be of prognostic value and can be used to obtain information on the mechanisms of mutagens with 'unknown' action, provided that structural features are taken into account. Hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA), hexamethylmelamine (HEMEL), tetramethylurea (TMU) and dimethylpropyleneurea (DMPU) all show SLRL: ring-X loss ratios that match those of multifunctional agents, 0.08, 0.12, 0.08, and 0.16, respectively. The ratios for the pyrrolizidine alkaloids monocrotalin and seniciphilline, 0.053 and 0.24 respectively, also correspond with this group of mutagens. The low ratios for formaldehyde, 2-chloro-acetaldehyde and 2-chloroethyl methanesulfonate, 0.30, 0.052 and 0.36 respectively, are indicative that cross-linking may attribute considerably to their mutagenic action in Drosophila. On the other hand, not all mutagens containing 2 reactive groups act as cross-linking agents. The ratio for 1,2-dibromoethane, 2.7, indicates that it may act as a monofunctional agent. This is in accordance with the proposed activation mechanism by glutathione S-transferase, producing a monofunctional half-mustard derivative (Rannug, 1980; van Bladeren et al., 1981).",1988,"E W Vogel, J A Zijlstra"

Interacting genes that affect microtubule function: the nc2 allele of the haywire locus fails to complement mutations in the testis-specific beta-tubulin gene of Drosophila,3128461,10.1101/gad.2.1.82,"A mutation that fails to complement certain alleles of the testis-specific beta 2-tubulin gene (B2t) of Drosophila melanogaster maps to a separate locus, haywire, located at 3-34.4 map units in polytene region 67E3-F3. Second-site non-complementing mutations such as haync2 and B2t alleles could identify genes that encode products that participate in the same functions or that interact in the same structure. Consistent with a structural interaction between the hay gene product and beta 2-tubulin, the genetic interaction between haync2 and B2t requires the presence of the mutant hay gene product; a deficiency for the hay region complements the same alleles of B2t that haync2 fails to complement. haync2 is a recessive male sterile mutation in a genetic background that is wild type at the B2t locus. Homozygous males have defects in meiosis, flagellar elongation and nuclear shaping, the three major microtubule-based processes in which the testis-specific beta 2-tubulin participates. The haync2 allele also has effects outside of spermatogenesis. It is a temperature-sensitive semilethal mutation, and homozygous haync2 females have reduced fertility.

Their widespread phylogenetic distribution, and the tissue and stage specificity of their expression in other organisms, argue that they play a general and significant role in animal development. In D. melanogaster, all homoeo-box genes characterized to date are involved in major aspects of embryogenesis. We report here the molecular characterization of a Drosophila homoeo-box gene that has no apparent involvement in early embryogenesis. The gene appears to be rough, a gene implicated in pattern formation in the developing eye. It is expressed in cells within, and posterior to, the morphogenetic furrow, the site of the primary pattern forming events in the developing retina, and also in a region of the brain of the third instar larva. We have found no genetic or molecular evidence of a role for this gene in other aspects of fly development.",1988,"R Saint, B Kalionis, T J Lockett, A Elizur"
A pattern formation mechanism to control spatial organization in the embryo of Drosophila melanogaster,3147345,10.1016/s0022-5193(88)80216-9,"It is known that cells are already committed to a particular segment at the cellular blastoderm stage during embryogenesis of Drosophila melanogaster. Recently, several segmentation genes have been observed to be expressed in a sequence of banded spatial patterns in the syncytial blastoderm, prior to the formation of the cellular blastoderm. It is demonstrated in this paper that a two component reaction-diffusion (RD) system with net production functions which are antisymmetric with respect to the uniform steady-state values, is capable of producing a sequence of seven spatial patterns in the syncytial blastoderm. The sequence of patterns obtained exhibit a strong preference for banded or striped patterns. The first pattern is a simple anteroposterior gradient while the second is a gradient in the dorsoventral direction. The next five patterns are a sequence of banded patterns which exhibit frequency doubling, i.e. the number of bands in each pattern tend to be double the number in the previous pattern. The predicted pattern sequence is comparable to that observed in the expression of some segmentation genes. It is suggested that a pattern formation mechanism based on such an RD system may exist in the embryo where it produces a sequence of prepatterns to regulate the expression of various segmentation genes leading ultimately to a segmented embryo. There is sufficient spatial information in the sequence of banded prepatterns for the segments to be unique.",1988,B N Nagorcka
Ribosomal proteins: mutant phenotypes by the numbers and associated gene expression changes,32810425,10.1098/rsob.200114,"Ribosomal proteins are highly conserved, many universally so among organisms. All ribosomal proteins are structural parts of the same molecular machine, the ribosome. However, when ribosomal proteins are mutated individually, they often lead to distinct and intriguing phenotypes, including specific human pathologies. This review is an attempt to collect and analyse all the reported phenotypes of each ribosomal protein mutant in several eukaryotes (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, Danio rerio, Mus musculus, Homo sapiens). These phenotypes were processed with unbiased computational approaches to reveal associations between different phenotypes and the contributions of individual ribosomal protein genes. An overview of gene expression changes in ribosomal protein mutants, with emphasis on ribosome profiling studies, is also presented. The available data point to patterns that may account for most of the observed phenotypes. The information presented here may also inform future studies about the molecular basis of the phenotypes that arise from mutations in ribosomal proteins.",2020,Michael Polymenis
Ecdysone controlled cell and tissue deletion,31745213,10.1038/s41418-019-0456-9,"The removal of superfluous and unwanted cells is a critical part of animal development. In insects the steroid hormone ecdysone, the focus of this review, is an essential regulator of developmental transitions, including molting and metamorphosis. Like other steroid hormones, ecdysone works via nuclear hormone receptors to direct spatial and temporal regulation of gene transcription including genes required for cell death. During insect metamorphosis, pulses of ecdysone orchestrate the deletion of obsolete larval tissues, including the larval salivary glands and the midgut. In this review we discuss the molecular machinery and mechanisms of ecdysone-dependent cell and tissue removal, with a focus on studies in Drosophila and Lepidopteran insects.",2020,"Xin Jiang, Donna Denton, Tianqi Xu, Sharad Kumar"
Multiple lineages enable robust development of the neuropil-glia architecture in adult Drosophila,32051172,10.1242/dev.184085,"Neural remodeling is essential for the development of a functional nervous system and has been extensively studied in the metamorphosis of Drosophila Despite the crucial roles of glial cells in brain functions, including learning and behavior, little is known of how adult glial cells develop in the context of neural remodeling. Here, we show that the architecture of neuropil-glia in the adult Drosophila brain, which is composed of astrocyte-like glia (ALG) and ensheathing glia (EG), robustly develops from two different populations in the larva: the larval EG and glial cell missing-positive (gcm+ ) cells. Whereas gcm + cells proliferate and generate adult ALG and EG, larval EG dedifferentiate, proliferate and redifferentiate into the same glial subtypes. Each glial lineage occupies a certain brain area complementary to the other, and together they form the adult neuropil-glia architecture. Both lineages require the FGF receptor Heartless to proliferate, and the homeoprotein Prospero to differentiate into ALG. Lineage-specific inhibition of gliogenesis revealed that each lineage compensates for deficiency in the proliferation of the other. Together, the lineages ensure the robust development of adult neuropil-glia, thereby ensuring a functional brain.",2020,"Kentaro Kato, Minako Orihara-Ono, Takeshi Awasaki"
[Intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms regulating neuronal dendrite morphogenesis],32621417,,"Neurons are the structural and functional unit of the nervous system. Precisely regulated dendrite morphogenesis is the basis of neural circuit assembly. Numerous studies have been conducted to explore the regulatory mechanisms of dendritic morphogenesis. According to their action regions, we divide them into two categories: the intrinsic and extrinsic regulators of neuronal dendritic morphogenesis. Intrinsic factors are cell type-specific transcription factors, actin polymerization or depolymerization regulators and regulators of the secretion or endocytic pathways. These intrinsic factors are produced by neuron itself and play an important role in regulating the development of dendrites. The extrinsic regulators are either secreted proteins or transmembrane domain containing cell adhesion molecules. They often form receptor-ligand pairs to mediate attractive or repulsive dendritic guidance. In this review, we summarize recent findings on the intrinsic and external molecular mechanisms of dendrite morphogenesis from multiple model organisms, including Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila and mice. These studies will provide a better understanding on how defective dendrite development and maintenance are associated with neurological diseases.",2020,"Weixia Zhao, Wei Zou"
A Robust and Self-Sustained Peripheral Circadian Oscillator Reveals Differences in Temperature Compensation Properties with Central Brain Clocks,32798967,10.1016/j.isci.2020.101388,"Circadian clocks are characterized by three properties: they run in constant conditions with a period of ∼24 h, synchronize to the environmental cycles of light and temperature, and are temperature compensated, meaning they do not speed up with temperature. Central brain clocks regulate daily activity rhythms, whereas peripheral clocks are dispersed throughout the body of insects and vertebrates. Using a set of luciferase reporter genes, we show that Drosophila peripheral clocks are self-sustained but over-compensated, i.e., they slow down with increasing temperature. In contrast, central clock neurons in the fly brain, both in intact flies and in cultured brains, show accurate temperature compensation. Although this suggests that neural network properties contribute to temperature compensation, the circadian neuropeptide Pigment Dispersing Factor (PDF) is not required for temperature-compensated oscillations in brain clock neurons. Our findings reveal a fundamental difference between central and peripheral clocks, which likely also applies for vertebrate clocks.",2020,"Ralf Stanewsky, Karla-Marlen Ernst, Marijke Versteven"
The ovo locus is required for sex-specific germ line maintenance in Drosophila,3428601,10.1101/gad.1.9.913,Mutations at the ovo locus result in a defective female germ line. The male germ line is not affected. Adult females homozygous for loss-of-function alleles have no germ line stem cells. The sex-specific phenotype is evident at late blastoderm and early gastrula stages when the pole cells of embryos homozygous for a loss-of-function allele begin to die. This is the only zygotically acting gene known that is required specifically for embryonic germ line survival. Females heterozygous for dominant alleles or homozygous for alleles reducing gene activity exhibit a range of defects in oogenesis. We have mapped the ovo locus to position 4E1-2 of the salivary gland X chromosome by using a set of cytologically visible deletions.,1987,"B Oliver, A P Mahowald, N Perrimon"
Gene encoding cytoskeletal proteins in Drosophila rhabdomeres,3103129,10.1073/pnas.84.4.985,"The ninaC gene is one of eight nina (neither inactivation nor afterpotential) genes identified from mutations that drastically reduce the amount of rhodopsin in the compound eye of Drosophila melanogaster. The gene has been cytogenetically localized to the 27E-28B region of the second chromosome. NaDodSO4/PAGE analysis of eye proteins of flies carrying one, two, or three copies of the ninaC region shows that two eye-specific proteins of molecular weight 170,000 and 130,000 display a strong dependence on the dosage of the ninaC gene, although the dependence is evident only when the dosage is decreased and not when it is increased. All mutations in the ninaC gene studied to date have pronounced effects on these two polypeptides. These results suggest that the ninaC locus encodes these two polypeptides. Ultrastructural studies show that the polypeptides encoded by ninaC are very likely to be important components of the cytoskeletal structure of rhabdomeral microvilli.",1987,"Q Pye, H Matsumoto, K Isono, W L Pak"
The product of the Drosophila zeste gene binds to specific DNA sequences in white and Ubx,3608982,,"Three different segments of the zeste coding sequence were inserted in an expression vector and antibodies were raised against the resulting zeste-beta galactosidase hybrid proteins. The antibodies were used to analyse the zeste protein produced in bacteria from a different expression vector containing the entire zeste coding region. The major products made in bacteria as well as the products of in vitro translation of zeste RNA migrate anomalously upon SDS--acrylamide gel electrophoresis. Specific DNA fragments from the white and Ubx gene co-immunoprecipitate with zeste protein. At least two independent zeste binding sites are found in a 250-bp interval of the white regulatory region that contains also the sites of wsp mutations, which are known to be deficient in zeste interaction.",1987,"V Pirrotta, M Benson"
Developmentally regulated alternate modes of expression of the Gpdh locus of Drosophila,3935431,,"Immunoblot analyses have been performed on extracts prepared from Drosophila melanogaster. Those analyses have revealed two subunit forms of enzyme glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) in larval tissues and in adult abdominal tissues. Thoracic tissue, which accounts for the bulk of the adult GPDH, has only one subunit form, the smaller. The two subunit forms differ by approximately 2400 daltons. In agreement with previous genetic and biochemical data indicating that this enzyme is encoded by a single structural gene, analyses of extracts prepared from a strain carrying a GPDH null mutation detect no GPDH polypeptides in larvae or adults. Similarly, analyses of extracts prepared from a strain carrying a mutation which produces a GPDH polypeptide that differs in size from wild-type reveal a change in the adult thoracic GPDH polypeptide as well as a change in both GPDH polypeptides found in larvae. Total Drosophila RNA prepared from larvae or newly eclosed adults has been translated in a mRNA-dependent cell-free system. GDPH was immunoprecipitated from the translation products and analyzed. Two subunit forms of GPDH were immunoprecipitated from translation products whose synthesis was directed by larval RNA and only one was detected in the polypeptides synthesized from adult RNA. The GPDH polypeptides synthesized in vitro are approximately the same size as the corresponding polypeptides found in vivo. The relative proportion of total GPDH represented by each subunit form synthesized in vitro is similar to those found in vivo.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1985,"D T Sullivan, G R Skuse"
Molecular cloning of alpha-amylase genes from Drosophila melanogaster. I. Clone isolation by use of a mouse probe,3924727,,"A cloned alpha-amylase cDNA sequence from the mouse is homologous to a small set of DNA sequences from Drosophila melanogaster under appropriate conditions of hybridization. A number of recombinant lambda phage that carry homologous Drosophila genomic DNA sequences were isolated using the mouse clone as a hybridization probe. Putative amylase clones hybridized in situ to one or the other of two distinct sites in polytene chromosome 2R and were assigned to one of two classes, A and B. Clone lambda Dm32, representing class A, hybridizes within chromosome section 53CD. Clone lambda Dm65 of class B hybridizes within section 54A1-B1. Clone lambda Dm65 is homologous to a 1450- to 1500-nucleotide RNA species, which is sufficiently long to code for alpha-amylase. No RNA homologous to lambda Dm32 was detected. We suggest that the class B clone, lambda Dm65, contains the functional Amy structural gene(s) and that class A clones contain an amylase pseudogene.",1985,"W W Doane, J N Levy, R M Gemmill"
