Ancestral polymorphisms in Drosophila pseudoobscura and Drosophila miranda,21767458,10.1017/S0016672311000206,"Ancestral polymorphisms are defined as variants that arose by mutation prior to the speciation event that generated the species in which they segregate. Their presence may complicate the interpretation of molecular data and lead to incorrect phylogenetic inferences. They may also be used to identify regions of the genome that are under balancing selection. It is thus important to take into account the contribution of ancestral polymorphisms to variability within species and divergence between species. Here, we extend and improve a method for estimation of the proportion of ancestral polymorphisms within a species, and apply it to a dataset of 33 X-linked and 34 autosomal protein-coding genes for which sequence polymorphism data are available in both Drosophila pseudoobscura and Drosophila miranda, using Drosophila affinis as an outgroup. We show that a substantial proportion of both X-linked and autosomal synonymous variants in these two species are ancestral, and that a small number of additional genes with unusually high sequence diversity seem to have an excess of ancestral polymorphisms, suggestive of balancing selection.",2011,"Reuben W Nowell, Penelope R Haddrill, Brian Charlesworth"
Sticky/Citron kinase maintains proper RhoA localization at the cleavage site during cytokinesis,22084308,10.1083/jcb.201105136,"In many organisms, the small guanosine triphosphatase RhoA controls assembly and contraction of the actomyosin ring during cytokinesis by activating different effectors. Although the role of some RhoA effectors like formins and Rho kinase is reasonably understood, the functions of another putative effector, Citron kinase (CIT-K), are still debated. In this paper, we show that, contrary to previous models, the Drosophila melanogaster CIT-K orthologue Sticky (Sti) does not require interaction with RhoA to localize to the cleavage site. Instead, RhoA fails to form a compact ring in late cytokinesis after Sti depletion, and this function requires Sti kinase activity. Moreover, we found that the Sti Citron-Nik1 homology domain interacts with RhoA regardless of its status, indicating that Sti is not a canonical RhoA effector. Finally, Sti depletion caused an increase of phosphorylated myosin regulatory light chain at the cleavage site in late cytokinesis. We propose that Sti/CIT-K maintains correct RhoA localization at the cleavage site, which is necessary for proper RhoA activity and contractile ring dynamics.",2011,"Koen J Verbrugghe, Zuni I Bassi, Pier Paolo D'Avino, David M Glover, Luisa Capalbo, Stephen Gregory, Emilie Montembault"
Spinster controls Dpp signaling during glial migration in the Drosophila eye,21562262,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0459-11.2011,"The development of multicellular organisms requires the well balanced and coordinated migration of many cell types. This is of particular importance within the developing nervous system, where glial cells often move long distances to reach their targets. The majority of glial cells in the peripheral nervous system of the Drosophila embryo is derived from the CNS and migrates along motor axons toward their targets. In the developing Drosophila eye, CNS-derived glial cells move outward toward the nascent photoreceptor cells, but the molecular mechanisms coupling the migration of glial cells with the growth of the eye imaginal disc are mostly unknown. Here, we used an enhancer trap approach to identify the gene spinster, which encodes a multipass transmembrane protein involved in endosome-lysosome trafficking, as being expressed in many glial cells. spinster mutants are characterized by glial overmigration. Genetic experiments demonstrate that Spinster modulates the activity of several signaling cascades. Within the migrating perineurial glial cells, Spinster is required to downregulate Dpp (Decapentaplegic) signaling activity, which ceases migratory abilities. In addition, Spinster affects the growth of the carpet cell, which indirectly modulates glial migration.",2011,"Christian Klämbt, Yeliz Yuva-Aydemir, Ann-Christin Bauke"
"Remarkable expression in the colon adenocarcinoma of Hmat-Xa, a human mannosyltransferase-like gene, that is homologous to drosophila gene GC15914",21821951,10.1271/bbb.110124,"We cloned a novel human mannosyltransferase-like gene, designated Hmat-Xa, as a gene homologous to the Drosophila GC15914 gene encoding the 9QVXN0 protein: see ""Project Report for FY2002 on the 'Construction of Libraries of Human Genes Participating in Glycosylation' project"" 43-45 (2003), New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO), NEDO and Research Association for Biotechnology, Tokyo, Japan (in Japanese).

Cardiomyopathy is associated with ribosomal protein gene haplo-insufficiency in Drosophila melanogaster,21890737,10.1534/genetics.111.131482,"The Minute syndrome in Drosophila melanogaster is characterized by delayed development, poor fertility, and short slender bristles. Many Minute loci correspond to disruptions of genes for cytoplasmic ribosomal proteins, and therefore the phenotype has been attributed to alterations in translational processes. Although protein translation is crucial for all cells in an organism, it is unclear why Minute mutations cause effects in specific tissues. To determine whether the heart is sensitive to haplo-insufficiency of genes encoding ribosomal proteins, we measured heart function of Minute mutants using optical coherence tomography. We found that cardiomyopathy is associated with the Minute syndrome caused by haplo-insufficiency of genes encoding cytoplasmic ribosomal proteins. While mutations of genes encoding non-Minute cytoplasmic ribosomal proteins are homozygous lethal, heterozygous deficiencies spanning these non-Minute genes did not cause a change in cardiac function. Deficiencies of genes for non-Minute mitochondrial ribosomal proteins also did not show abnormal cardiac function, with the exception of a heterozygous disruption of mRpS33. We demonstrate that cardiomyopathy is a common trait of the Minute syndrome caused by haplo-insufficiency of genes encoding cytoplasmic ribosomal proteins. In contrast, most cases of heterozygous deficiencies of genes encoding non-Minute ribosomal proteins have normal heart function in adult Drosophila.",2011,"Brian Dong, Il-Man Kim, Howard A Rockman, Stephan Frangakis, Matthew J Wolf, Dennis Abraham, Michelle E Casad, Na Lin"
Analysis of a Drosophila amplicon in follicle cells highlights the diversity of metazoan replication origins,21933960,10.1073/pnas.1114209108,"To investigate the properties of metazoan replication origins, recent studies in cell culture have adopted the strategy of identifying origins using genome-wide approaches and assessing correlations with such features as transcription and histone modifications. Drosophila amplicon in follicle cells (DAFCs), genomic regions that undergo repeated rounds of DNA replication to increase DNA copy number, serve as powerful in vivo model replicons. Because there are six DAFCs, compared with thousands of origins activated in the typical S phase, close molecular characterization of all DAFCs is possible. To determine the extent to which the six DAFCs are different or similar, we investigated the developmental and replication properties of the newly identified DAFC-34B. DAFC-34B contains two genes expressed in follicle cells, although the timing and spatial patterns of expression suggest that amplification is not a strategy to promote high expression at this locus. Like the previously characterized DAFC-62D, DAFC-34B displays origin activation at two separate stages of development. However, unlike DAFC-62D, amplification at the later stage is not transcription-dependent. We mapped the DAFC-34B amplification origin to 1 kb by nascent strand analysis and delineated cis requirements for origin activation, finding that a 6-kb region, but not the 1-kb origin alone, is sufficient for amplification. We analyzed the developmental localization of the origin recognition complex (ORC) and the minichromosome maintenance (MCM)2-7 complex, the replicative helicase. Intriguingly, the final round of origin activation at DAFC-34B occurs in the absence of detectable ORC, although MCMs are present, suggesting a new amplification initiation mechanism.",2011,"Terry L Orr-Weaver, Jane C Kim"
Semaphorin-1a is required for Aedes aegypti embryonic nerve cord development,21738767,10.1371/journal.pone.0021694,"Although mosquito genome projects have uncovered orthologues of many known developmental regulatory genes, extremely little is known about mosquito development. In this study, the role of semaphorin-1a (sema1a) was investigated during vector mosquito embryonic ventral nerve cord development. Expression of sema1a and the plexin A (plexA) receptor are detected in the embryonic ventral nerve cords of Aedes aegypti (dengue vector) and Anopheles gambiae (malaria vector), suggesting that Sema1a signaling may regulate mosquito nervous system development. Analysis of sema1a function was investigated through siRNA-mediated knockdown in A. aegypti embryos. Knockdown of sema1a during A. aegypti development results in a number of nerve cord phenotypes, including thinning, breakage, and occasional fusion of the longitudinal connectives, thin or absent commissures, and general distortion of the nerve cord. Although analysis of Drosophila melanogaster sema1a loss-of-function mutants uncovered many similar phenotypes, aspects of the longitudinal phenotypes differed between D. melanogaster and A. aegypti. The results of this investigation suggest that Sema1a is required for development of the insect ventral nerve cord, but that the developmental roles of this guidance molecule have diverged in dipteran insects.",2011,"Akio Mori, Morgan Haugen, Ellen Flannery, Michael Tomchaney, Molly Duman-Scheel, Susanta K Behura, David W Severson"
GiSAO.db: a database for ageing research,21609420,10.1186/1471-2164-12-262,"Background: Age-related gene expression patterns of Homo sapiens as well as of model organisms such as Mus musculus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster are a basis for understanding the genetic mechanisms of ageing. For an effective analysis and interpretation of expression profiles it is necessary to store and manage huge amounts of data in an organized way, so that these data can be accessed and processed easily. Description: GiSAO.db (Genes involved in senescence, apoptosis and oxidative stress database) is a web-based database system for storing and retrieving ageing-related experimental data. Expression data of genes and miRNAs, annotation data like gene identifiers and GO terms, orthologs data and data of follow-up experiments are stored in the database. A user-friendly web application provides access to the stored data. KEGG pathways were incorporated and links to external databases augment the information in GiSAO.db. Search functions facilitate retrieval of data which can also be exported for further processing. Conclusions: We have developed a centralized database that is very well suited for the management of data for ageing research. The database can be accessed at https://gisao.genome.tugraz.at and all the stored data can be viewed with a guest account.",2011,"Johannes Grillari, Pidder Jansen-Dürr, Gerhard G Thallinger, Matthias Hackl, Günter Lepperdinger, Edith Hofer, Gerhard T Laschober, Zlatko Trajanoski"
Modes of metabolic compensation during mitochondrial disease using the Drosophila model of ATP6 dysfunction,21991365,10.1371/journal.pone.0025823,"Numerous mitochondrial DNA mutations cause mitochondrial encephalomyopathy: a collection of related diseases for which there exists no effective treatment. Mitochondrial encephalomyopathies are complex multisystem diseases that exhibit a relentless progression of severity, making them both difficult to treat and study. The pathogenic and compensatory metabolic changes that are associated with chronic mitochondrial dysfunction are not well understood. The Drosophila ATP6(1) mutant models human mitochondrial encephalomyopathy and allows the study of metabolic changes and compensation that occur throughout the lifetime of an affected animal. ATP6(1)animals have a nearly complete loss of ATP synthase activity and an acute bioenergetic deficit when they are asymptomatic, but surprisingly we discovered no chronic bioenergetic deficit in these animals during their symptomatic period. Our data demonstrate dynamic metabolic compensatory mechanisms that sustain normal energy availability and activity despite chronic mitochondrial complex V dysfunction resulting from an endogenous mutation in the mitochondrial DNA. ATP6(1)animals compensate for their loss of oxidative phosphorylation through increases in glycolytic flux, ketogenesis and Kreb's cycle activity early during pathogenesis. However, succinate dehydrogenase activity is reduced and mitochondrial supercomplex formation is severely disrupted contributing to the pathogenesis seen in ATP6(1) animals. These studies demonstrate the dynamic nature of metabolic compensatory mechanisms and emphasize the need for time course studies in tractable animal systems to elucidate disease pathogenesis and novel therapeutic avenues.",2011,"Michael J Palladino, Wayne Van Voorhies, Alicia M Celotto, Wai Kan Chiu"

"Evidence for compensatory upregulation of expressed X-linked genes in mammals, Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster",22019781,10.1038/ng.948,"Many animal species use a chromosome-based mechanism of sex determination, which has led to the coordinate evolution of dosage-compensation systems. Dosage compensation not only corrects the imbalance in the number of X chromosomes between the sexes but also is hypothesized to correct dosage imbalance within cells that is due to monoallelic X-linked expression and biallelic autosomal expression, by upregulating X-linked genes twofold (termed 'Ohno's hypothesis'). Although this hypothesis is well supported by expression analyses of individual X-linked genes and by microarray-based transcriptome analyses, it was challenged by a recent study using RNA sequencing and proteomics. We obtained new, independent RNA-seq data, measured RNA polymerase distribution and reanalyzed published expression data in mammals, C. elegans and Drosophila. Our analyses, which take into account the skewed gene content of the X chromosome, support the hypothesis of upregulation of expressed X-linked genes to balance expression of the genome.",2011,"David Sturgill, Di Kim Nguyen, Joseph B Hiatt, Felix Schlesinger, LaDeana W Hillier, Xinxian Deng, Brian Oliver, Sevinc Ercan, Valerie J Reinke, Jay Shendure, Christine M Disteche, Robert H Waterston, Jason D Lieb, Thomas R Gingeras, Carrie A Davis"
Targeted expression of p35 reveals a role for caspases in formation of the adult abdominal cuticle in Drosophila,21425087,10.1387/ijdb.103109rk,"Programmed cell death is a fundamental aspect of metazoan development associated with the elaboration of disparate tissues and structures. Specialized cysteine proteases, the caspases, are mediators of cell death; once activated they cleave substrate proteins to dismantle doomed cells. Caspase activity is regulated by several cellular and viral inhibitors. The baculovirus p35 protein blocks the action of a wide range of caspases and inhibits cell death in divergent species. Here, we utilize the Gal4/UAS system to target p35 expression and analyze the requirements of caspase activity for development in Drosophila. We confirm that cell death is essential for proper morphogenesis of the adult male external genitalia and distal portions of the legs. In addition, we find that caspases are also required for elimination of larval epidermal cells and normal elaboration of the adult abdominal cuticle by histoblast derivatives. In particular, rescued p35-expressing larval epidermal cells accumulate along the abdominal midline and are associated with corresponding splits in both dorsal and ventral cuticle structures. This study reveals a novel role for cell death in a specific morphogenetic processes.",2011,"John R Nambu, Rachel S Kester"
Functional and physical interaction between the mismatch repair and FA-BRCA pathways,21865299,10.1093/hmg/ddr366,"Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by bone marrow failure and an increased risk for leukemia and cancer. Fifteen proteins thought to function in the repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) comprise what is known as the FA-BRCA pathway. Activation of this pathway leads to the monoubiquitylation and chromatin localization of FANCD2 and FANCI. It has previously been shown that FANCJ interacts with the mismatch repair (MMR) complex MutLα. Here we show that FANCD2 interacts with the MMR proteins MSH2 and MLH1. FANCD2 monoubiquitylation, foci formation and chromatin loading are greatly diminished in MSH2-deficient cells. Human or mouse cells lacking MSH2 or MLH1 display increased sensitivity and radial formation in response to treatment with DNA crosslinking agents. Studies in human cell lines and Drosophila mutants suggest an epistatic relationship between FANCD2, MSH2 and MLH1 with regard to ICL repair. Surprisingly, the interaction between MSH2 and MLH1 is compromised in multiple FA cell lines, and FA cell lines exhibit deficient MMR. These results suggest a significant role for MMR proteins in the activation of the FA pathway and repair of ICLs. In addition, we provide the first evidence for a defect in MMR in FA cell lines.",2011,"James B Wilson, O John Semmes, Sahana Ananth, Stacy A Williams, Alyssa Mitson-Salazar, Allen E Bale, Andrei Tomashevski, Allison P Clark, Peter M Glazer, Nigel J Jones, Gary M Kupfer"
Loss of the Drosophila cell polarity regulator Scribbled promotes epithelial tissue overgrowth and cooperation with oncogenic Ras-Raf through impaired Hippo pathway signaling,21955824,10.1186/1471-213X-11-57,"Background: Epithelial neoplasias are associated with alterations in cell polarity and excessive cell proliferation, yet how these neoplastic properties are related to one another is still poorly understood. The study of Drosophila genes that function as neoplastic tumor suppressors by regulating both of these properties has significant potential to clarify this relationship. Results: Here we show in Drosophila that loss of Scribbled (Scrib), a cell polarity regulator and neoplastic tumor suppressor, results in impaired Hippo pathway signaling in the epithelial tissues of both the eye and wing imaginal disc. scrib mutant tissue overgrowth, but not the loss of cell polarity, is dependent upon defective Hippo signaling and can be rescued by knockdown of either the TEAD/TEF family transcription factor Scalloped or the transcriptional coactivator Yorkie in the eye disc, or reducing levels of Yorkie in the wing disc. Furthermore, loss of Scrib sensitizes tissue to transformation by oncogenic Ras-Raf signaling, and Yorkie-Scalloped activity is required to promote this cooperative tumor overgrowth. The inhibition of Hippo signaling in scrib mutant eye disc clones is not dependent upon JNK activity, but can be significantly rescued by reducing aPKC kinase activity, and ectopic aPKC activity is sufficient to impair Hippo signaling in the eye disc, even when JNK signaling is blocked. In contrast, warts mutant overgrowth does not require aPKC activity. Moreover, reducing endogenous levels of aPKC or increasing Scrib or Lethal giant larvae levels does not promote increased Hippo signaling, suggesting that aPKC activity is not normally rate limiting for Hippo pathway activity. Epistasis experiments suggest that Hippo pathway inhibition in scrib mutants occurs, at least in part, downstream or in parallel to both the Expanded and Fat arms of Hippo pathway regulation. Conclusions: Loss of Scrib promotes Yorkie/Scalloped-dependent epithelial tissue overgrowth, and this is also important for driving cooperative tumor overgrowth with oncogenic Ras-Raf signaling. Whether this is also the case in human cancers now warrants investigation since the cell polarity function of Scrib and its capacity to restrain oncogene-mediated transformation, as well as the tissue growth control function of the Hippo pathway, are conserved in mammals.",2011,"Karen Doggett, Anthony M Brumby, Felix A Grusche, Helena E Richardson"
Piezo controlled microinjection: an in vivo complement for in vitro sensory studies in insects,21871493,10.1016/j.jneumeth.2011.08.015,"Recent insights into insect olfactory signaling based on in vitro analyses have created an urgent need for equivalent in vivo analyses using living organisms. Here, we present a microinjection system that establishes a ""virtual petri dish"" within sensory structures for the application of agents to sensory neurons. Our system uses a series of pumps to inject chemical agents via air pressure into the surrounding lymph. We show using tetrodotoxin and forskolin application that robust effects on response dynamics of Drosophila melanogaster olfactory sensory neurons could be observed within 200 s, and suggest data analysis techniques to improve estimation of pharmacological effects on response kinetics.

Basic leucine zipper protein Cnc-C is a substrate and transcriptional regulator of the Drosophila 26S proteasome,21149573,10.1128/MCB.00799-10,"While the 26S proteasome is a key proteolytic complex, little is known about how proteasome levels are maintained in higher eukaryotic cells. Here we describe an RNA interference (RNAi) screen of Drosophila melanogaster that was used to identify transcription factors that may play a role in maintaining levels of the 26S proteasome. We used an RNAi library against 993 Drosophila transcription factor genes to identify genes whose suppression in Schneider 2 cells stabilized a ubiquitin-green fluorescent protein reporter protein. This screen identified Cnc (cap 'n' collar [CNC]; basic region leucine zipper) as a candidate transcriptional regulator of proteasome component expression. In fact, 20S proteasome activity was reduced in cells depleted of cnc. Immunoblot assays against proteasome components revealed a general decline in both 19S regulatory complex and 20S proteasome subunits after RNAi depletion of this transcription factor. Transcript-specific silencing revealed that the longest of the seven transcripts for the cnc gene, cnc-C, was needed for proteasome and p97 ATPase production. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR confirmed the role of Cnc-C in activation of transcription of genes encoding proteasome components. Expression of a V5-His-tagged form of Cnc-C revealed that the transcription factor is itself a proteasome substrate that is stabilized when the proteasome is inhibited. We propose that this single cnc gene in Drosophila resembles the ancestral gene family of mammalian nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-related transcription factors, which are essential in regulating oxidative stress and proteolysis.",2011,"Daniel Lundin, Patrick Young, Monica M Davis, Anne Beskow, Kristian Björk Grimberg"
FlyExpress: visual mining of spatiotemporal patterns for genes and publications in Drosophila embryogenesis,21994220,10.1093/bioinformatics/btr567,"Summary: Images containing spatial expression patterns illuminate the roles of different genes during embryogenesis.

In FlyExpress, each queryable embryo picture is a heat-map that captures the expression patterns of more than 4500 genes and more than 2600 published articles. In addition, one can view spatial patterns for particular genes over time as well as find other genes with similar expression patterns at a given developmental stage.

"Glypican Gene GPC5 Participates in the Behavioral Response to Ethanol: Evidence from Humans, Mice, and Fruit Flies",22384374,10.1534/g3.111.000976,"Alcohol use disorders are influenced by many interacting genetic and environmental factors. Highlighting this complexity is the observation that large genome-wide association experiments have implicated many genes with weak statistical support. Experimental model systems, cell culture and animal, have identified many genes and pathways involved in ethanol response, but their applicability to the development of alcohol use disorders in humans is undetermined. To overcome the limitations of any single experimental system, the analytical strategy used here was to identify genes that exert common phenotypic effects across multiple experimental systems. Specifically, we (1) performed a mouse linkage analysis to identify quantitative trait loci that influence ethanol-induced ataxia; (2) performed a human genetic association analysis of the mouse-identified loci against ethanol-induced body sway, a phenotype that is not only comparable to the mouse ethanol-ataxia phenotype but is also a genetically influenced endophenotype of alcohol use disorders; (3) performed behavioral genetic experiments in Drosophila showing that fly homologs of GPC5, the member of the glypican gene family implicated by both the human and mouse genetic analyses, influence the fly's response to ethanol; and (4) discovered data from the literature demonstrating that the genetically implicated gene's expression is not only temporally and spatially consistent with involvement in ethanol-induced behaviors but is also modulated by ethanol. The convergence of these data provides strong support to the hypothesis that GPC5 is involved in cellular and organismal ethanol response and the etiology of alcohol use disorders in humans.",2011,"Geoff Joslyn, Gerry Brush, Raymond L White, Lianqun Wu, Fred W Wolf, Marc Schuckit"

As for the human heart, Drosophila heart function also deteriorates with age. Notably, with progressive age the incidence of cardiac arrhythmias, myofibrillar disorganization and susceptibility to heart dysfunction and failure all increase significantly.

The Alg5 ortholog Wollknäuel is essential for correct epidermal differentiation during Drosophila late embryogenesis,21199819,10.1093/glycob/cwq213,"The formation of an extracellular matrix (ECM) presupposes an ordered delivery of its components to ensure its stereotypic architecture. The Drosophila cuticle is an ECM produced by the epidermis at its apical site and is characterized by a layered organization. To understand the mechanisms of cuticle assembly during development, we have investigated early aspects of protein N-glycosylation, i.e. the attachment of a dolichol-linked oligosaccharide to distinct Asn sites of a protein known to be essential for sorting in the secretory pathway. Mutations in the Drosophila alg5 gene wollknäuel (wol) that codes for an enzyme initiating the glucosylation of the dolichol-linked oligosaccharide decrease, as expected, glucosylation and the amounts of N-glycosylated proteins such as the cuticle-organizing factor Knickkopf, without affecting their correct localization. At the same time, the polarity determinants Crumbs and atypical protein kinase C accumulate at the apical plasma membrane in wol deficient embryos. In part, these perturbations may also be caused by the unfolded protein response, which is commonly triggered by ER stress and downsizes transcription and translation in general. In any case, they are associated with the loss of cuticle layering and aberrant apical plasma membrane organization suggesting that glucosylation, either directly or indirectly through controlling protein degradation, is important for the efficient and balanced deployment of the biochemical functions of secreted and membrane-associated proteins during epidermal differentiation.",2011,"Martin Pabst, Friedrich Altmann, Heinz Schwarz, Khaleelulla Saheb Shaik, Bernard Moussian"

These studies also identified the sensory neurons that innervate the terminal sensory cones as likely chemosensors that mediate this response. Here I summarize the data that led to these conclusions and also highlight evidence that suggests additional, as yet unidentified, proteins are also required for detecting increases and decreases in oxygen concentrations.",2011,David B Morton
Deciphering time measurement: the role of circadian 'clock' genes and formal experimentation in insect photoperiodism,21295039,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2011.01.013,"This review examines possible role(s) of circadian 'clock' genes in insect photoperiodism against a background of many decades of formal experimentation and model building. Since ovarian diapause in the genetic model organism Drosophila melanogaster has proved to be weak and variable, recent attention has been directed to species with more robust photoperiodic responses. However, no obvious consensus on the problem of time measurement in insect photoperiodism has yet to emerge and a variety of mechanisms are indicated. In some species, expression patterns of clock genes and formal experiments based on the canonical properties of the circadian system have suggested that a damped oscillator version of Pittendrigh's external coincidence model is appropriate to explain the measurement of seasonal changes in night length. In other species extreme dampening of constituent oscillators may give rise to apparently hourglass-like photoperiodic responses, and in still others there is evidence for dual oscillator (dawn and dusk) photoperiodic mechanisms of the internal coincidence type. Although the exact role of circadian rhythmicity and of clock genes in photoperiodism is yet to be settled, Bünning's general hypothesis (Bünning, 1936) remains the most persuasive unifying principle. Observed differences between photoperiodic clocks may be reflections of underlying differences in the clock genes in their circadian feedback loops.",2011,"R C Bertossa, D S Saunders"

The chromodomains of CHD1 are critical for enzymatic activity but less important for chromatin localization,21177652,10.1093/nar/gkq1298,"The molecular motor protein CHD1 has been implicated in the regulation of transcription and in the transcription-independent genome-wide incorporation of H3.3 into paternal chromatin in Drosophila melanogaster.

Here, we describe genetic and biochemical approaches to the study of the Drosophila CHD1 chromodomains. We found that overall localization of CHD1 on polytene chromosomes does not appreciably change in chromodomain-mutant flies. In contrast, the chromodomains are important for transcription-independent activities of CHD1 during early embryonic development as well as for transcriptional regulation of several heat shock genes. However, neither CHD1 nor its chromodomains are needed for RNA polymerase II localization and H3K4 methylation but loss of CHD1 decreases transcription-induced histone eviction at the Hsp70 gene in vivo.

In addition to its longstanding value as a genetically tractable model of organogenesis, recently it has emerged as an excellent system in which to combine genetics and live imaging. Rapidly improving ex vivo culture conditions, new fluorescent biosensors and photo-manipulation tools, and advances in microscopy have allowed direct observation in real time of processes such as stem cell self-renewal, collective cell migration, and polarized mRNA and protein transport. In addition, entirely new phenomena have been discovered, including revolution of the follicle within the basement membrane and oscillating assembly and disassembly of myosin on a polarized actin network, both of which contribute to elongating this tissue. This review focuses on recent advances in live-cell imaging techniques and the biological insights gleaned from live imaging of egg chamber development.",2011,"Li He, Xiaobo Wang, Denise J Montell"
Novel male-biased expression in paralogs of the aphid slimfast nutrient amino acid transporter expansion,21917168,10.1186/1471-2148-11-253,"Background: A major goal of molecular evolutionary biology is to understand the fate and consequences of duplicated genes. In this context, aphids are intriguing because the newly sequenced pea aphid genome harbors an extraordinary number of lineage-specific gene duplications relative to other insect genomes. Though many of their duplicated genes may be involved in their complex life cycle, duplications in nutrient amino acid transporters appear to be associated rather with their essential amino acid poor diet and the intracellular symbiosis aphids rely on to compensate for dietary deficits. Past work has shown that some duplicated amino acid transporters are highly expressed in the specialized cells housing the symbionts, including a paralog of an aphid-specific expansion homologous to the Drosophila gene slimfast. Previous data provide evidence that these bacteriocyte-expressed transporters mediate amino acid exchange between aphids and their symbionts. Results: We report that some nutrient amino acid transporters show male-biased expression. Male-biased expression characterizes three paralogs in the aphid-specific slimfast expansion, and the male-biased expression is conserved across two aphid species for at least two paralogs. One of the male-biased paralogs has additionally experienced an accelerated rate of non-synonymous substitutions. Conclusions: This is the first study to document male-biased slimfast expression. Our data suggest that the male-biased aphid slimfast paralogs diverged from their ancestral function to fill a functional role in males. Furthermore, our results provide evidence that members of the slimfast expansion are maintained in the aphid genome not only for the previously hypothesized role in mediating amino acid exchange between the symbiotic partners, but also for sex-specific roles.",2011,"Alex C C Wilson, Lubov Nathanson, Rebecca P Duncan"
Molecular characterization of Drosophila gene encoding G0 alpha subunit homolog,2509462,,"A Drosophila melanogaster gene (dgo) encoding a G protein alpha subunit has been isolated by screening genomic and adult head cDNA libraries using bovine transducin alpha subunit cDNA as probe. The gene, which maps to 47A on the second chromosome, encodes two proteins which are both 354 amino acids long but differ in seven amino acids in the amino-terminal region. The deduced amino acid sequences of the two proteins are 81% identical to that of a rat Go alpha subunit. Analysis of genomic clones revealed that there are eight coding exons and that the putative transcripts for the two proteins differ in the 5'-noncoding regions and the first coding exons but share the remaining six coding exons. The arrangement of two different 5'-noncoding regions on the gene suggests that two different promoters regulate the expression of the transcripts encoding the two proteins. RNA blot analysis detected three transcripts: a 3.9-kilobase (kb) transcript found at all stages of development; a 5.4-kb transcript present predominantly in adult heads; and a 3.4-kb transcript present only in adult bodies. In situ hybridizations of a cDNA probe to adult tissue sections showed that the gene is expressed abundantly in neuronal cell bodies in the brain, optic lobe, and thoracic ganglia.",1989,"M H Perdew, B T Bloomquist, S Schneuwly, R D Shortridge, J Yoon, W L Pak"
Ionic coupling and mitotic synchrony of siblings in a Drosophila cell line,2509224,10.1016/0014-4827(89)90348-0,"Following mitosis in many cell lines, siblings remain adjoined in dyads until further cell division. We report here a series of experiments designed to ascertain the nature of this apposition in the embryonic Kc cell line of Drosophila melanogaster. We have found that (1) cell division in siblings is highly synchronized when compared to that in nonsiblings: (2) siblings in dyads are dye coupled with respect to Lucifer Yellow, but intercellular diffusion of larger molecules (FITC-dextran at 6 and 24 kDa) is retarded: (3) siblings are electrically coupled by an ungated low-resistance intercellular connection which is resistant to treatment with octanol and CO2, both known to close gap junction channels: and (4) members of a dyad are joined by a cytoplasmic bridge. Structures resembling septate junctions are also found between siblings and between cells in aggregates. The evidence accumulated here suggests that cytokinesis in Kc dyads is incomplete, resulting in an intercellular pathway that may provide for the passage of a molecular or electrical signal that regulates subsequent mitosis.",1989,"D C Spray, P Cherbas, L Cherbas, E A Morales, G M Carrow"

Using the amplified cDNA-segments as probes, we demonstrated that there is one Na+,K(+)-ATPase and one Ca2(+)-ATPase (sarcoplasmic reticulum-type) gene in the Drosophila genome.

Ca2(+)-dependent proteolytic modification of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase in Drosophila wild-type and dunce memory mutants,2560483,10.3109/01677068909107104,"Two cAMP-dependent protein kinases with different activation constants were separated from Drosophila melanogaster head extracts. Both are only found in nervous tissue. The first cAMP-dependent kinase, with Mr = 190,000, has been already characterized as tetrameric Drosophila type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase R2C2. The second purified cAMP-dependent protein kinase, with Mr = 80,000, is dimeric in structure RPC, and the cAMP-concentration required for half maximal activation is 4 fold lower than for the type II kinase. The generation of RP can be stimulated in vitro by addition of exogenous calcium and is due to an endogenous Ca2(+)-dependent protease that selectively degrades the regulatory subunit. Extraction in the presence of various protease inhibitors does not affect the amounts of RP, suggesting that the observed quantitative change in RP occurs in vivo. The amounts of RP in the nervous tissue of the memory mutants dunce1 and dunce2, which have increased cAMP levels, are different from the amount of RP in wild-type flies. Also treatments of wild-type flies with drugs affecting cAMP-metabolism and acetylcholine levels led to amounts of RP different from untreated flies.",1989,"U Müller, H C Spatz"
Pattern triplications following genetic ablation on the wing ofDrosophila : Effect of eliminating thepolyhomeotic gene,28305874,10.1007/BF02447741,"The effects ofpolyhomeotic (ph) mutants in imaginal cells have been studied in a clonal analysis. Clones of cells, homozygous forph, sort-out after a few divisions, probably as a consequence of modified cell affinities. The dorso-ventral margin of the wing has special characteristics that retard this phenomenon. The formation and exclusion of a clone of 8-16 cells affect the polarity of the wild-type neighbour cells and can provoke pattern triplications. The results suggest that a defect in intercellular communication prevents the wild-type cells from maintaining coordinated positional information. The cells react by regenerative growth, and reorganize into a new pattern. The pleiotropic phenotypes ofph mutants are explained according to a common hypothesis aboutph + function.",1989,"Neel B Randsholt, Janet Deatrick, Pedro Santamaria"

Juvenile hormone bisepoxide biosynthesis in vitro by the ring gland of Drosophila melanogaster: a putative juvenile hormone in the higher Diptera,2493154,10.1073/pnas.86.4.1421,"The in vitro production of juvenile hormone (JH) was investigated by using isolated ring glands from third instar Drosophila melanogaster. A JH-like molecule is secreted that comigrates with a synthetic sample of methyl 6,7;10,11-bisepoxy-3,7,11-trimethyl-(2E)-dodecenoate (JHB3) during TLC, liquid chromatography, and GC analysis. Purified product from farnesoic acid-stimulated ring glands was analyzed by electron impact GC/MS and gave a mass spectrum identical to synthetic JHB3. Additional structure confirmation was obtained following conversion of product from unstimulated biosynthesis to a derivative that comigrated on liquid chromatography with the derivative prepared from synthetic JHB3. Physiological studies revealed that JHB3 is produced solely by the corpus allatum portion of the ring gland in vitro. Isolated ring glands from other cyclorrhaphous dipteran larvae also produce JHB3 almost exclusively in vitro. Corpora allata from mosquito larvae, however, produce only JH III, indicating that JHB3 production may be restricted to the higher Diptera. Topically applied synthetic JHB3 caused developmental responses in newly formed D. melanogaster white puparia similar to those obtained with JH III. The data suggest that JHB3 is a fly juvenile hormone.",1989,"V C Henrich, C C Reuter, T J Sliter, L I Gilbert, S W Applebaum, F C Baker, D S Richard, D A Schooley"
Geographic variation in the territorial success of Drosophila melanogaster males,2497722,10.1007/BF01065908,"Drosophila melanogaster males defend food against other males to increase their access to females on food. The territorial behavior of stocks collected from Townsville, Corindi, and Melbourne on the east coast of Australia were compared. Males from these stocks showed the same incidence of territorial encounters. However, Melbourne males were more successful at obtaining territories in competition with Townsville or Corindi males. This difference could be accounted for largely by variation in body weight, although territorial success was also determined by other factors because Townsville and Corindi males that held territories were not heavier than Melbourne males. In reciprocal crosses between the populations there was directional dominance for increased territorial success. F1 males were of intermediate weight and F1 males that held territories tended to be lighter than territorial Melbourne males. Melbourne males were more successful than Townsville males because they tended to win escalated encounters, resulting in displacement of territory residents.",1989,A A Hoffmann

The caudal gene product is a direct activator of fushi tarazu transcription during Drosophila embryogenesis,2571934,10.1038/341340a0,"A drosophila pair-rule segmentation gene, fushi tarazu (ftz), encodes a protein which is expressed in a characteristic seven-stripe pattern. The promoter sequences that are sufficient for generating this spatially restricted pattern of expression are located within 669 base pairs upstream of the transcription start site. Multiple transcriptional activators and repressors interact with this 'zebra-stripe' promoter unit to bring about the positional specificity of ftz transcription. Here we report that the homoeodomain-containing protein encoded by caudal (cad) is one such regulator. The cad gene product can increase the level of ftz transcription in the posterior half of the embryo by interacting with multiple copies of a TTTATG consensus sequence located in the zebra-stripe unit. This result demonstrates one pathway by which the product of a maternally expressed segmentation gene, expressed in an antero-posterior concentration gradient, can directly regulate the expression of a pair-rule gene.",1989,"J Topol, C S Parker, C R Dearolf"

Properties of a Drosophila RNA polymerase II elongation factor,2722810,,"We have purified from nuclear extracts of Drosophila Kc cells a 36-kDa protein, DmS-II, which has an effect on the elongation properties of RNA polymerase II. DmS-II stimulates RNA polymerase II during the transcription of double-stranded DNA templates when the nonphysiological divalent cation manganese is present. In the presence of physiological mono- and divalent cations, the factor reduces the tendency of RNA polymerase II to pause at specific sites along a dC-tailed template including the major pause encountered after 14 nucleotides have been incorporated. Based on its size and chromatographic properties, as well as its ability to stimulate RNA polymerase II activity in the presence of manganese, the protein seems to be analogous to a factor S-II purified from mouse cells (Sekimizu, K., Kobayashi, N., Mizuno, D., and Natori, S. (1976) Biochemistry 15, 5064-5070).

cGMP-dependent protein kinase genes in Drosophila,2732245,,"Two Drosophila genes encoding products related to cGMP-dependent protein kinase have been isolated by cross-hybridization to a Drosophila cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit gene. Both genes encode products with putative cGMP binding and kinase domains on the same polypeptide chain, as found for the prototypical bovine lung cGMP-dependent protein kinase. The deduced product of one gene (DG1; cytological position, 21D) is 14% larger than the bovine enzyme and differs substantially in sequence at the amino terminus, the region responsible in the bovine enzyme for dimerization. The second gene (DG2; cytological position, 24A) is transcribed into three major RNA species of different size. The largest (DG2; T1) and smallest (DG2;T3) RNAs encode overlapping polypeptides of similar sequence to the whole length of bovine lung cGMP-dependent protein kinase. The translation product of the third major RNA (DG2;T2) lacks sequences similar to those that constitute the dimerization and kinase inhibitory domains of the bovine enzyme. The percentage amino acid identity between DG1 or DG2 and bovine lung cGMP-dependent protein kinase is 55 and 64%, respectively. A common progenitor of the two cGMP-dependent protein kinase genes, DG1 and DG2, is strongly suggested by the conserved positions of introns in these genes.",1989,"G M Rubin, D Kalderon"
"The chicken homeo box genes CHox1 and CHox3: cloning, sequencing and expression during embryogenesis",2568317,10.1016/0378-1119(89)90008-5,"Several Drosophila genes involved in the control of segmentation and segment identity share a 183-bp conserved sequence termed homeo box. Homeo box sequences have been detected and cloned from the genomes of insects like Drosophila to vertebrates such as mouse and man. Two chicken homeo box genes CHox1 and CHox3, are described. Cloning of the CHox1 and CHox3 homeo boxes was performed using Drosophila and murine homeo box sequences as probes under low-stringency conditions. Analysis of both chicken homeo box sequences revealed them to be homeo boxes that have diverged from the Antennapedia class with homologies to homeo boxes of other organisms in the range of 75-42% at the nucleotide level and 69-41% at the protein level. Analysis of CHox3 expression during early embryo development showed that the gene codes for five transcripts 1.3, 1.9, 2.6, 5.6 and 7.9 kb in size. Three of the transcripts (1.3, 1.9 and 5.6 kb) are also recognized by a flanking non-homeo box containing probe. The levels of the different transcripts changed during the first five days of development. The most abundant transcripts (1.3 and 1.9 kb) are already present at the time the egg is laid. Their transcription peaks at day 1 of incubation and then decreases. The CHox1 transcripts are present at very low levels between days 2.5 and 4 of development.

Drosophila ninaA gene encodes an eye-specific cyclophilin (cyclosporine A binding protein),2664782,10.1073/pnas.86.14.5390,"Mutations in the ninaA gene of Drosophila severely reduce the amount of rhodopsin specifically in R1-6 photoreceptors. Isolation of the ninaA gene by chromosomal walking revealed that it is expressed only in the eye and encodes a 237-amino acid polypeptide that shows strong sequence similarity to cyclophilin, a putative molecular target for cyclosporine A, a potent immunosuppressant used in human organ transplantations. Unlike most cyclophilins characterized to date, the ninaA-encoded protein has a putative signal sequence and a transmembrane domain. Each of the three ehtyl methanesulfonate-induced ninaA mutant alleles analyzed shows a single nucleotide change in the mRNA coding region leading to either a nonsense or a missense mutation. We find no evidence that the ninaA-encoded protein is directly involved in phototransduction. The only detectable mutant phenotype that correlates with the severity of molecular defects in the three mutants is the amount of depletion of R1-6 rhodopsin. The above results and the recent findings that cyclophilin is a peptidylprolyl cis-trans-isomerase suggest that the ninaA-encoded protein may be required for proper folding and stability of R1-6 rhodopsin.",1989,"T Ono, M Ozaki, S Schneuwly, R D Shortridge, D C Larrivee, W L Pak"
NTP Toxicology and Carcinogenesis Studies of Hydroquinone (CAS No. 123-31-9) in F344/N Rats and B6C3F1 Mice (Gavage Studies),12692638,,"Hydroquinone is used an antioxidant in the rubber industry and as a developing agent in photography. It is also an intermediate in the manufacture of rubber and food antioxidants and monomer inhibitors. Hydroquinone and products containing hydroquinone are used as depigmenting agents to lighten skin. NTP Toxicology and Carcinogenesis studies were conducted by administering hydroquinone (greater than 99% pure) in corn oil or water by gavage to groups of F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice of each sex for 14 days, 13 weeks, or 2 years. Additionally, genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium, mouse lymphoma cells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, and Drosophila melanogaster. Preliminary 3-day dermal studies were conducted with rats and mice using sufficient hydroquinone in 95% ethanol to crystallize on the skin (4 or 40 mg per animal); conjugated metabolites of hydroquinone were detected in the urine. Fourteen-day dermal studies were conducted at doses up to 3,840 mg/kg for rats and 4,800 mg/kg for mice. No toxic effects were seen in the 3- or 14-day dermal studies. Therefore, in further evaluations of hydroquinone, the gavage route of administration was used. Results of Fourteen-Day and Thirteen-Week Studies: Fourteen-day gavage studies were conducted by administering hydroquinone in corn oil to rats at doses ranging from 63 to 1,000 mg/kg body weight and to mice at doses ranging from 31 to 500 mg/kg. All rats receiving 1,000 mg/kg and 1/5 male and 4/5 female rats receiving 500 mg/kg died before the end of the 14 days. Compound-related clinical signs in rats included tremors lasting up to 30 minutes after each dosing at 500 and 1,000 mg/kg. In the 14-day gavage studies with mice, 4/5 male mice and 5/5 female mice receiving 500 mg/kg and 3/5 males receiving 250 mg/kg died before the end of the studies. Tremors followed by convulsions were seen at 250 and 500 mg/kg. In the 13-week studies, doses for rats and mice ranged from 25 to 400 mg/kg. All rats receiving 400 mg/kg and 3/10 female rats receiving 200 mg/kg died before the end of the studies. The mean body weight at necropsy of male rats administered 100 or 200 mg/kg was about 8%-9% lower than that of vehicle controls. Mean body weights of vehicle control and dosed female rats at necropsy were similar. Tremors and convulsions were observed after dosing in most rats receiving 400 mg/kg and in several female rats receiving 200 mg/kg. Inflammation and/or epithelial hyperplasia (acanthosis) of the forestomach were seen in 4/10 male rats and 1/10 female rats receiving 200 mg/kg. Toxic nephropathy, characterized by tubular cell degeneration in the renal cortex, was seen in 7/10 male and 6/10 female rats receiving 200 mg/kg and in 1/10 females receiving 100 mg/kg. In the 13-week studies in mice, 8/10 males and 8/10 females receiving 400 mg/kg and 2/10 male mice receiving 200 mg/kg died early. Mean body weights of dosed and vehicle control mice at necropsy were similar. Liver weight to body weight ratios for dosed male mice were significantly greater than for vehicle controls. Ulceration, inflammation, or epithelial hyperplasia of the forestomach was found in 3/10 male and 2/10 female mice receiving 400 mg/kg and 1/10 females receiving 200 mg/kg. Based on these collective results, 2-year studies were conducted by administering 0, 25, or 50 mg/kg hydroquinone in deionized water by gavage to groups of 65 rats of each sex, 5 days per week. Groups of 65 mice of each sex were administered 0, 50, or 100 mg/kg on the same schedule. Ten rats and 10 mice from each group were killed after 15 months for an interim evaluation. Observations at Fifteen Months: In the rats killed at 15 months, the relative kidney weight for high dose male rats was greater than that for vehicle controls. The hematocrit value, hemoglobin concentration, and erythrocyte count for high dose female rats were decreased. Compound-related increased severity of nephropathy was observed in male rats. In mice killed at 15 months, the relative liver weights for high dose male and female mice were signif and female mice were significantly greater than those for vehicle controls. Lesions seen in the liver of male mice included increased syncytial cells and diffuse cytomegaly. Body Weights, Organ Weights, and Survival in the Two-Year Studies: Mean body weights of high dose male rats were 5&percnt;-13&percnt; lower than those of vehicle controls after week 73, and those of low dose male rats were 5&percnt;-9&percnt; lower than those of vehicle controls after week 89. Mean body weights of dosed female rats were similar to those of vehicle controls throughout the study. The relative kidney and liver weights for high dose male rats were higher than those for vehicle controls. Mean body weights of high dose male mice were 5&percnt;-8&percnt; lower than those of vehicle controls after week 93, and those of high dose female mice were 5&percnt;-14&percnt; lower after week 20. Relative liver weights were increased for dosed male and high dose female mice. No significant differences in survival were observed between any groups of rats or mice of either sex after 2 years (male rats: vehicle control, 27/55; low dose, 18/55; high dose, 18/55; female rats: 40/55; 27/55; 32/55; male mice: 33/55; 37/54; 36/55; female mice: 37/55; 39/55; 36/55). Nonneoplastic and Neoplastic Effects in the Two-Year Studies: Nearly all male rats and most female rats in all vehicle control and dosed groups had nephropathy. The severity of this disease was judged to be greater in high dose male rats. Hyperplasia of the renal pelvic transitional epithelium and renal cortical cysts, changes observed with advanced renal disease, were increased in male rats. Renal tubular hyperplasia was seen in 2 high dose male rats, and renal tubular adenomas were seen in 4/55 low dose and 8/55 high dose male rats; none was seen in vehicle controls. Mononuclear cell leukemia in female rats occurred with a positive trend, and the incidences in the dosed groups were greater than that in the vehicle controls (vehicle control, 9/55; low dose, 15/55; high dose, 22/55). The historical incidence of leukemia in water gavage vehicle control female F344/N rats is 25&percnt; &plusmn; 15&percnt; and in untreated controls is 19&percnt; &plusmn; 7&percnt;. Compound-related lesions observed in the liver of high dose male mice included anisokaryosis (0/55; 2/54; 12/55), syncytial alteration (5/55; 3/54; 25/55), and basophilic foci (2/55; 5/54; 11/55). The incidences of hepatocellular adenomas were increased in dosed male mice (9/55; 21/54; 20/55), but these increases were offset by decreases in the incidences of hepatocellular carcinomas (13/55; 11/54; 7/55). The incidences of hepatocellular neoplasms, primarily adenomas, were increased in dosed female mice (3/55; 16/55; 13/55). Follicular cell hyperplasia of the thyroid gland was increased in dosed mice (male: 5/55; 15/53; 19/54; female: 13/55; 47/55; 45/55). Follicular cell adenomas were seen in 2/55 vehicle control, 1/53 low dose, and 2/54 high dose male mice and in 3/55 vehicle control, 5/55 low dose, and 6/55 high dose female mice, a follicular cell carcinoma was seen in a seventh high dose female mouse. The highest observed incidence of follicular cell adenomas or carcinomas(combined) in historical water gavage vehicle control female B6C3F1 mice is 3/48 (6&percnt;). Genetic Toxicology: Hydroquinone was not mutagenic in S. typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, or TA1537 with or without exogenous metabolic activation. It induced trifluorothymidine (Tft) resistance in mouse L5178Y/TK lymphoma cells in the presence or absence of metabolic activation. An equivocal response was obtained in tests for induction of sex-linked recessive lethal mutations in Drosophila administered hydroquinone by feeding. Hydroquinone induced sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) in CHO cells both with or without exogenous metabolic activation and caused chromosomal aberrations in the presence of activation. Conclusions: Under the conditions of these 2-year gavage studies, there was some evidence of carcinogenic activity of hydroquinone for male F344/N rats, as shown by marked increases in tubular cell adenomas of the kidney. There was some evidence of carcinogenic activity of hydroquinone for female F344/N rats, as shown by increases in mononuclear cell leukemia. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of hydroquinone for male B6C3F1 mice administered 50 or 100 mg/kg in water by gavage. There was some evidence of carcinogenic activity of hydroquinone for female B6C3F1 mice, as shown by increases in hepatocellular neoplasms, mainly adenomas. Administration of hydroquinone was associated with thyroid follicular cell hyperplasia in both male and female mice and anisokaryosis, multinucleated hepatocytes, and basophilic foci of the liver in male mice.

Identification and characterization of BRDT: A testis-specific gene related to the bromodomain genes RING3 and Drosophila fsh,9367677,10.1006/geno.1997.5000,"The RING3 gene encodes a 90-kDa mitogen-activated nuclear protein. In proliferating cells, including in leukemia, RING3 has serine-threonine kinase and autophosphorylation activities. The cloning of D26362, a gene closely related to RING3, suggests a gene family. RING3 and D26362 are also related to the Drosophila developmental gene fsh. A database search for further members of the RING3 family identified an EST derived from a testis-specific library. cDNA clones representing the full coding sequence of the gene were isolated. The gene encodes a protein of 947 amino acids with extensive homology to RING3, D26362, and fsh. Similar to these proteins, it possesses two bromodomain motifs and a PEST sequence. Northern analysis of 16 normal tissues and eight cancer cell lines shows transcripts of 3.5 and 4.0 kb expressed specifically in testis.

The primers were designed from publicly available database cDNA sequences selected according to their homology to the human nn23-H1 putative metastasis suppressor gene. The full-length cDNA sequence predicts a 187 amino acid protein possessing the region homologous to NDP kinases with all residues crucial for nucleotide binding and catalysis, strongly suggesting that Nm23-H4 possesses NDP kinase activity. It shares 56, 55 and 60% identity with Nm23-H1, Nm23-H2 and DR-Nm23, respectively, the other human Nm23 proteins isolated so far. Compared with these proteins, Nm23-H4 contains an additional NH2-terminal region that is rich in positively charged residues and could indicate routing to mitochondria. The nm23-H4 gene has been localised to human chromosomal band 16p13.3. The corresponding 1.2 kb mRNA is widely distributed and expressed in a tissue-dependent manner, being found at very high levels in prostate, heart, liver, small intestine and skeletal muscle tissues and in low amounts in the brain and in blood leucocytes.

A network of interacting transcriptional regulators involved in Drosophila neural fate specification revealed by the yeast two-hybrid system,9371806,10.1073/pnas.94.24.13099,"Neural fate specification in Drosophila is promoted by the products of the proneural genes, such as those of the achaete-scute complex, and antagonized by the products of the Enhancer of split [E(spl)] complex, hairy, and extramacrochaetae. As all these proteins bear a helix-loop-helix (HLH) dimerization domain, we investigated their potential pairwise interactions using the yeast two-hybrid system. The fidelity of the system was established by its ability to closely reproduce the already documented interactions among Da, Ac, Sc, and Extramacrochaetae. We show that the seven E(spl) basic HLH proteins can form homo- and heterodimers inter-se with distinct preferences. We further show that a subset of E(spl) proteins can heterodimerize with Da, another subset can heterodimerize with proneural proteins, and yet another with both, indicating specialization within the E(spl) family. Hairy displays no interactions with any of the HLH proteins tested. It does interact with the non-HLH protein Groucho, which itself interacts with all E(spl) basic HLH proteins, but with none of the proneural proteins or Da. We investigated the structural requirements for some of these interactions by site-specific and deletion mutagenesis.",1997,"C Delidakis, S M Parkhurst, G Poortinga, P Alifragis"
The effect of polymorphic inversions on body size in two natural populations of Drosophila buzzatii from Argentina,9350138,10.1111/j.1601-5223.1997.00233.x,"Previous works in a colonized and an original population of Drosophila buzzatii have shown a consistent relationship between the inversion polymorphism and thorax length, a measure of body size. However, the populations studied in those reports share a close genealogical relationship as suggested by several lines of evidence. In the present paper, we revisit this issue by analysing the correlation between second chromosome arrangements and thorax length in two Argentinian natural populations (Termas de Río Hondo and Arroyo Escobar) from different biogeographic areas with different host plants. Our findings are: (1) inversion frequencies were significantly different between populations; (2) the mean thorax length of flies collected in both populations was not significantly different; and (3) we obtain confirming evidence that flies carrying 2st, the ancestral gene order, have on average a smaller body size than those carrying the derived arrangements (2j and 2jz3). These results suggest that the biometrical effect of inversions on body size previously described are due to genetic differences between arrangements and not to the close historical relationship between the populations studied in previous reports.",1997,"C Rodríguez, E Hasson, J J Fanara"
A zebrafish Id homologue and its pattern of expression during embryogenesis,9256354,10.1016/s0925-4773(97)00071-3,"We describe the cloning, sequencing and pattern of transcript distribution during embryogenesis of a zebrafish Id homologue that we have called Id6. Transcription of the gene is spatially regulated, and its pattern of transcription shows considerable overlaps with those of other zebrafish genes with homology to Drosophila neurogenic genes, such as Notch and Delta. Since all these genes are coexpressed in particular cells, they may function together in a single genetic circuit in zebrafish as they do in Drosophila. A zebrafish homologue of Drosophila AS-C proteins can activate transcription of a CAT reporter gene by binding to an E-box in mouse 3T3 cells, either alone or in conjunction with ZfE12. The activation of transcription is inhibited in the presence of Id6. This indicates that the zebrafish gene described here is a genuine member of the Id family, and suggests that it may serve a function similar to that of the Drosophila gene emc and mammalian Ids during development.",1997,"S Sawai, J A Campos-Ortega"
"The expression of the mouse Zic1, Zic2, and Zic3 gene suggests an essential role for Zic genes in body pattern formation",9070329,10.1006/dbio.1996.8449,"We examined the expression of Zic1, Zic2, and Zic3 genes in the mouse embryo by means of in situ hybridization. Zic genes were found as a group of genes coding for zinc finger proteins that are expressed in a restricted manner in the adult mouse cerebellum. We showed that the genes are the vertebrate homologues of Drosophila odd-paired, which may play an essential role in parasegmental subdivision and in visceral mesoderm development. The expression of the three Zic genes was first detected at gastrulation in a spatially restricted manner. At neurulation, the expression became restricted to the dorsal neural ectoderm and dorsal paraxial mesoderm. During organogenesis, the three genes were expressed in specific regions of several developing organs, including dorsal areas of the brain, spinal cord, paraxial mesenchyme, and epidermis, the marginal zone of the neural retina and distal regions of the developing limb. For all stages, significant differences in the spatial expression of Zic1, Zic2, and Zic3 were observed. Furthermore, the expression of Zic genes in Pax3, Wnt-1, and Wnt-3a mutant embryos suggested that Zic genes are not primarily regulated by the three genes which were expressed in dorsal areas similar to Zic genes. However, in open brain, a mutant with severe neural tube defects, and in the Wnt-3a mutant mice, the expression of Zic genes was changed. The changed expression pattern in Wnt-3a mutant mice suggests that Zic genes in the neural tube are regulated by the factors from notochord. Our findings suggest that Zic genes are involved in many developmental processes. Furthermore, analysis of gene expression patterns in different mouse mutants indicated that Zic genes may act upstream of many known developmental regulatory genes.",1997,"S Takada, K Schughart, J Aruga, K Mikoshiba, T Günther, R Spörle, T Nagai"
Partial characterization of a fatty acid desaturase gene in Drosophila melanogaster,9501419,10.1016/s0965-1748(97)00077-5,"The open reading frame of a gene encoding a protein homologous to vertebrate fatty acid desaturases has been characterized in Drosophila melanogaster. This is the first description of a desaturase sequence in insects. Two cDNAs were cloned: the combined 1.5 kb nucleotide sequences indicate that the gene encodes a polypeptide of 383 amino acid residues with a high sequence similarity to the well defined delta 9 desaturases from rat and yeast and desaturases from carp and tick. The Drosophila protein contains two histidine cluster motifs (HXXHH) and two hydrophobic regions which are conserved among all desaturases, whereas the amino and carboxy ends look more variable. The desaturase gene seems to be expressed in adults at a low level, with a greater prevalence in females than in males. Two genomic sequences have been amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and have a very similar open reading frame but a different organization; one with three introns and the other without introns. Both seem to correspond to two distinct genes and have been named ""desat locus"". They are localized to a single locus, 87C, on the right arm of the third chromosome. The possible involvement of the desat product in the biosynthesis of D. melanogaster contact pheromones is discussed.",1997,"C Henriet, R Dallerac, C Wicker-Thomas"
IS THE PRODUCTION OF MULTIPLE SPERM TYPES ADAPTIVE?,28568578,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1997.tb03662.x,"Males of many species concurrently produce more than one sperm type, now called sperm heteromorphism. In the Drosophila obscura group, all species examined to date produce multiple sperm types that differ in sperm length. Short sperm types in at least three obscura group species do not participate in fertilization, leading to questions regarding the adaptive value of sperm heteromorphism. The common and pervasive inheritance of this trait in the obscura group, however, may indicate that sperm heteromorphism is phylogenetically constrained and therefore does not reflect an adaptive response to selection pressures. I measured interspecific variation in sperm length and determined the number of sperm types produced in 10 obscura group species. I subsequently tested if interspecific variation in sperm length is significantly associated with phylogeny by using an autoregressive comparative method. All obscura group species examined produce two visually distinct sperm lengths, short and long. Phylogenetic autoregression analyses indicated that 22% of the interspecific variation in long sperm is related to phylogeny, whereas short sperm are not significantly correlated with phylogeny. These results suggest different selection pressures on the two sperm length types; long sperm have evolved in response to fertilization demands and short sperm have been decoupled from these requirements.",1997,Rhonda R Snook
Temperature-sensitive expression of Drosophila neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors,9109505,10.1046/j.1471-4159.1997.68051812.x,"Heterologous expression of cloned Drosophila nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunits indicates that these proteins misfold when expressed in mammalian cell lines at 37 degrees C. This misfolding can, however, be overcome either by growing transfected mammalian cells at lower temperatures or by the expression of Drosophila nAChR subunits in a Drosophila cell line. Whereas the Drosophila nAChR beta subunit (SBD) cDNA, reported previously, lacked part of the SBD coding sequence, here we report the construction and expression of a full-length SBD cDNA. We have examined whether problems in expressing functional Drosophila nAChRs in either Xenopus oocytes or mammalian cell lines can be attributed to an inability of these expression systems to assemble correctly Drosophila nAChRs. Despite expression in what might be considered a more native cellular environment, we have been unable to detect functional nAChRs in a Drosophila cell line unless Drosophila nAChR subunit cDNAs are coexpressed with vertebrate nAChR subunits. Our results indicate that the folding of Drosophila nAChR subunits is temperature-sensitive and strongly suggest that the inability of these Drosophila nAChR subunits to generate functional channels in the absence of vertebrate subunits is due to a requirement for coassembly with as yet unidentified Drosophila nAChR subunits.",1997,"N S Millar, S J Lansdell, D B Sattelle, B Schmitt, H Betz"
NMR studies of unfolded states of an SH3 domain in aqueous solution and denaturing conditions,9092826,10.1021/bi9627626,"The isolated N-terminal SH3 domain of the Drosophila adapter protein drk (drkN SH3 domain) exists in a dynamic equilibrium between a folded (F(exch)) and an unfolded (U(exch)) state under native-like buffer conditions [Zhang, O., & Forman-Kay, J. D. (1995) Biochemistry 34, 6784-6794]. The effect of binding a proline-rich peptide derived from the protein Sos, a biological target of the drkN SH3 domain, on this equilibrium has been investigated. The stabilization of the F(exch) folded state upon binding provides an example of the link between binding and protein folding or stabilization. We have compared NMR parameters of the U(exch) state with those of a denatured state in 2 M guanidine hydrochloride (U(Gdn)). Variable-temperature experiments demonstrate that interactions in a region encompassing residues Gln 23-Leu 28 in the U(exch) state are destabilized upon addition of guanidine hydrochloride. Data from an 15N HSQC-NOESY-HSQC experiment as well as recently developed methods provide more unambiguous structural information than described previously, showing the presence of preferential structure in both unfolded states. Backbone NOEs observed in both unfolded states as well as chemical shifts and coupling constants suggest a rapid equilibrium between extended structure and turn-like structures which may play a role in initiation of protein folding. However, differences in detailed structural features between the two unfolded states argue that caution is needed in interpretation of results from structural characterization of protein conformational states generated using denaturing conditions.",1997,"J D Forman-Kay, O Zhang"
A polarity field is established early in the development of the Drosophila compound eye,9431805,10.1016/s0925-4773(97)00127-5,"The photoreceptors within the ommatidia of the Drosophila compound eye form a trapezoid.

We find that ectopic morphogenetic furrows induced on the eye field margin (or midline) and those induced in the body of the field have different consequences for the establishment of retinal polarity. Furthermore, the dorsal/ventral vector field is established early in development, prior to and independent of the initiation of the morphogenetic furrow.

Chemical shift mapping of the RNA-binding interface of the multiple-RBD protein sex-lethal,9398148,10.1021/bi970830y,"The Drosophila protein Sex-lethal (Sxl) contains two RNP consensus-type RNA-binding domains (RBDs) separated by a short linker sequence. Both domains are essential for high-affinity binding to the single-stranded polypyrimidine tract (PPT) within the regulated 3' splice site of the transformer (tra) pre-mRNA. In this paper, the effect of RNA binding to a protein fragment containing both RBDs from Sxl (Sxl-RBD1 + 2) has been characterized by heteronuclear NMR. Nearly complete (85-90%) backbone resonance assignments have been obtained for unbound and RNA-bound states of Sxl-RBD1 + 2. A comparison of amide 1H and 15N chemical shifts between free and bound states has highlighted residues which respond to RNA binding. The beta-sheets in both RBDs (RBD1 and RBD2) form an RNA interaction surface, as has been observed in other RBDs. A significant number of residues display different behavior when comparing RBD1 and RBD2. This argues for a model in which RBD1 and RBD2 of Sxl have different or nonanalogous points of interaction with the tra PPT. R142 (in RBD2) exhibits the largest chemical shift change upon RNA binding. The role of R142 in RNA binding was tested by measuring the Kd of a mutant of Sxl-RBD1 + 2 in which R142 was replaced by alanine. This mutant lost the ability to bind RNA, showing a correlation with the chemical shift difference data.

"Negative regulation of Armadillo, a Wingless effector in Drosophila",9187151,,"Drosophila Armadillo and its vertebrate homolog beta-catenin play essential roles both in the transduction of Wingless/Wnt cell-cell signals and in the function of cell-cell adherens junctions. Wingless and Wnts direct numerous cell fate choices during development. We generated a mutant protein, Armadillo(S10), with a 54 amino acid deletion in its N-terminal domain. This mutant is constitutively active in Wingless signaling; its activity is independent of both Wingless signal and endogenous wild-type Armadillo. Armadillo's role in signal transduction is normally negatively regulated by Zeste-white 3 kinase, which modulates Armadillo protein stability. Armadillo(S10) is more stable than wild-type Armadillo, suggesting that it is less rapidly targeted for degradation. We show that Armadillo(S10) has escaped from negative regulation by Zeste white-3 kinase, and thus accumulates outside junctions even in the absence of Wingless signal. Finally, we present data implicating kinases in addition to Zeste white-3 in Armadillo phosphorylation. We discuss two models for the negative regulation of Armadillo in normal development and discuss how escape from this regulation contributes to tumorigenesis.",1997,"S Orsulic, A Bejsovec, L M Pai, M Peifer"
Cloning of a disintegrin metalloproteinase that processes precursor tumour-necrosis factor-alpha,9034191,10.1038/385733a0,"Tumour-necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is a cytokine that contributes to a variety of inflammatory disease states.

We have purified TACE and cloned its complementary DNA. TACE is a membrane-bound disintegrin metalloproteinase. Structural comparisons with other disintegrin-containing enzymes indicate that TACE is unique, with noteable sequence identity to MADM, an enzyme implicated in myelin degradation, and to KUZ, a Drosophila homologue of MADM important for neuronal development. The expression of recombinant TACE (rTACE) results in the production of functional enzyme that correctly processes precursor TNF-alpha to the mature form.

The roles of hedgehog and engrailed in patterning adult abdominal segments of Drosophila,9367426,,"We present evidence that hedgehog (hh) protein secreted by posterior compartment cells plays a key role in patterning the posterior portion of the anterior compartment in adult abdominal segments. Loss of function of hh in the hh(ts2) mutant causes the loss of posterior tergite characteristics in the anterior compartment, whereas ectopic expression driven by hs-hh or the gain-of-function allele hh(Mir) causes transformation of anterior structures toward the posterior. FLP-out hh-expressing clones in the anterior compartment induce surrounding wild-type cells to produce posterior tergite structures, establishing that hh functions nonautonomously. The effects of pulses of ectopic expression driven by hs-hh indicate that bristle type and pigmentation are patterned by hh at widely different times in pupal development. We also present evidence that the primary polarization of abdominal segments is symmetric. This symmetry is strikingly revealed by ectopic expression of engrailed (en). As expected, this transforms anterior compartment cells to posterior compartment identity. In addition, however, ectopic en expression causes an autonomous reversal of polarity in the anterior portion of the anterior compartment, but not the posterior portion. By determining the position of polarity reversal within en-expressing clones, we were able to define a cryptic line of symmetry that lies within the pigment band of the normal tergite. This line appears to be retained in hh(ts2) mutants raised at the restrictive temperature, suggesting it is not established by hh signaling. We argue that the primary role of hh in controlling polarity is to cause anterior compartment cells to reverse their interpretation of an underlying symmetric polarization. Consistent with this, we find that strong ectopic expression of hh causes mirror-symmetric double posterior patterning, whereas hh loss of function can cause mirror-symmetric double anterior patterning.",1997,"M A Muskavitch, I Duncan, A Kopp"

Role of suppressor of hairless in the delta-activated Notch signaling pathway,9171444,,"The Notch protein (N) acts as a transmembrane receptor for intercellular signals controlling cell fate choices in vertebrates and invertebrates. Genetical and molecular evidence indicates that, during Drosophila neurogenesis, an evolutionarily conserved transcription factor, Suppressor of Hairless [Su(H)], transduces the signal of N activation by its ligand Delta (D1). Su(H) plays a direct role in the immediate response of the genome to N signaling by up-regulating the transcription of the Enhancer of split Complex [E(spl)-C] genes. These findings suggest that the N transduction pathway can be described as a simple, linear cascade of molecular activation. At the molecular level, the mechanism of Su(H) ""activation"" is yet unknown. Two non-exclusive models have been proposed. In the first one, Su(H) binds to inactive N at the membrane. The binding of D1 to N in the extracellular space somehow interferes with the N-mediated cytoplasmic retention of Su(H), resulting in the nuclear translocation and ""activation"" of Su(H). In the second model, DNA-bound Su(H) is proposed to be ""activated"" in the nucleus by the direct binding of a processed form of N, acting as a transcriptional coactivator.

There is a graded requirement for dpp activity in the early embryo: high levels of dpp activity specify the amnioserosa, while progressively lower levels specify dorsal and lateral ectoderm. This potential for dpp to specify cell fate is highly dosage sensitive. In the wild-type embryo, increasing the gene dosage of dpp can shift cell fates along the dorsal-ventral axis. Furthermore, in mutant embryos, in which only a subset of the dorsal-ventral pattern elements are represented, increasing the gene dosage of dpp can specifically transform those pattern elements into more dorsal ones.

Enhancer detector analysis of the extent of genomic involvement in nervous system development in Drosophila melanogaster,8392532,10.1002/neu.480240609,"We conducted a survey of the patterns of gene expression in the central nervous system (CNS) of larvae of the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster to identify genes that may be important in the development of the CNS, aid in the recognition of basic organizing features that might underlie CNS development, and estimate the extent of the use of information encoded in the genome in the construction of the nervous system. A so-called enhancer detector strategy was used to generate many thousands of lines containing a beta-galactosidase reporter gene. These lines were screened as third-instar larvae for patterns of expression in the developing optic lobes and other portions of the CNS. Most of the lines recovered which evidence staining within the CNS could be included in one of a relatively small number of patterns. A random sample of 594 lines from the larger population screened was selected to quantify the relative frequencies of these patterns, and a more careful analysis of the changes in the patterns of expression with developmental time was done for representative lines of nine of the patterns. These studies demonstrated great variability in the pattern of gene expression as a function of developmental stage. Few, if any, lines showed beta-galactosidase activity limited to the optic lobes; similarly, few lines were identified in which staining was limited to only a small number of cells. Together with the limited number of patterns of gene expression seen, this suggests that in the larval CNS developmental pathways may be controlled by a combinatorial process of gene activity that involves the majority of the genome rather than by having a specific gene specify the fate of only a few neuronal precursors.",1993,"K Stark, D R Kankel, S Datta"
Developmental and molecular characterization of mutations in the Drosophila-raf serine/threonine protein kinase,8375330,,"Formation of the tail region of the Drosophila larva requires the activities of the terminal class genes. Genetic and molecular analyses of these genes suggests that localized activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase torso at the posterior egg pole triggers a signal transduction pathway. This pathway, mediated through the serine/threonine protein kinase D-raf and the protein tyrosine phosphatase corkscrew, controls the domains of expression of the transcription factors tailless and huckebein. In this paper, we report the molecular and developmental characterization of mutations in the D-raf gene. We show that mutations that alter conserved residues known to be necessary for kinase activity are associated with a null phenotype, demonstrating that D-raf kinase activity is required for its role in torso signaling. Another mutation, D-rafPB26, which prematurely truncates the kinase domain shows a weaker maternal effect phenotype that is strikingly similar to the corkscrew maternal effect phenotype, suggesting that a lower amount of kinase activity decreases the terminal signaling pathway. Finally, molecular and developmental characterization of two mutations that affect the late D-raf zygotic function(s) implies a novel role for D-raf in cell fate establishment in the eye. One of these mutations, D-rafC110, is associated with a single amino acid change within the putative D-raf regulatory region, while the other, D-rafHM-7, most likely reduces the wild-type amount of D-raf protein.",1993,"L A Perkins, M B Melnick, L Ambrosio, N Perrimon, M Lee"
In utero rearrangements in the trithorax-related oncogene in infant leukaemias,8497319,10.1038/363358a0,"The majority (approximately 75%) of infant acute leukaemias have a reciprocal translocation between chromosome 11q23 and one of several partner chromosomes. The gene at 11q23 (named MLL, ALL-1, HRX or HTRX-1; refs 2-6) has been cloned and shares homology with the Drosophila developmental gene trithorax. Rearrangements of this gene (called HRX here) occur in introns and cluster in a region of approximately 10 kb; individual patients have different breakpoints. Here we describe three pairs of infant twins with concordant leukaemia who each share unique (clonal) but non-constitutive HRX rearrangements in their leukaemic cells, providing evidence that the leukaemogenic event originates in utero and unequivocal support for the intra-placental 'metastasis' hypothesis for leukaemia concordance in twins.",1993,"H Mahmoud, C M Steel, A M Ford, M Greaves, L C Chan, S A Ridge, M E Cabrera"

The daughterless gene product in Drosophila is a nuclear protein that is broadly expressed throughout the organism during development,8217842,10.1016/0925-4773(93)90005-i,"The daughterless (da) gene in Drosophila functions in the regulation of at least three significant developmental pathways: sex determination, neurogenesis and oogenesis. As a member of the helix-loop-helix (HLH) family of DNA binding proteins, the da gene product appears to act as a transcription factor. Based on the genetic and molecular characterization of da, it has been proposed that the da protein (Da) functions as a generic member of this family, serving throughout development as a necessary binding partner for an assortment of other HLH proteins. As a result of temporally and/or spatially restricted expression, these binding partners would provide some regulatory specificity to the functional transcription complex. In order to participate in this way in the regulation of multiple genes, Da must be expressed in numerous times and places during development. Using anti-Da antibodies, we validate two predictions of this scenario of Da function: (1) Da protein is not only nuclear localized, but also associated with chromosomes in vivo; and (2) Da protein is widely distributed, both spatially and temporally, throughout development. With regard to the essential role of maternal da+ in progeny sex determination, little, if any, Da protein is synthesized in the maternal germline. This suggests that the female-specific germline function of da+ is provided to the zygote as maternally synthesized RNA that becomes translated early in embryogenesis.",1993,"C A Cummings, C Cronmiller"
Common mechanisms for the control of eukaryotic transcriptional elongation,8274141,10.1002/bies.950151005,"Regulation of transcriptional elongation is emerging as an important control mechanism for eukaryotic gene expression. In this essay, we review the basis of the current view of the regulation of elongation in the human c-myc gene and discuss similarities in elongation control among the c-myc, Drosophila hsp70 and the HIV-1 genes. Based upon these similarities, we propose a model for control of expression of these genes at the elongation phase of transcription.

Effects of tropomyosin deficiency in flight muscle of Drosophila melanogaster,8109330,10.1007/978-1-4615-2872-2_15,"We have studied the structure and function of muscle fibers in which tropomyosin stoichiometry has been reduced by genetic mutation. We used a Drosophila melanogaster flightless mutant Ifm(3)3 and a genetic cross of this mutant with wild type flies to achieve a gradation of tropomyosin gene dosage. We measured the flight ability and wingbeat frequency of the live insects and the ultrastructure and mechanochemistry of isolated single flight muscle fibers. Flight ability is impaired when tropomyosin gene dosage is reduced. Wingbeat frequency also depends upon gene dosage as well as the severity of myofilament lattice disruption and the number of myofilaments in the organized core of the myofibrils. A reduction in number of myofilaments appears to result in a reduction in active muscle stiffness without resulting in an appreciable change in kinetics of force production. Ifm(3)3 is trapped in a relaxed state and cannot generate active force. However, tight-binding rigor cross-bridges are able to form; in the absence of ATP, Ifm(3)3 muscle fibers have high stiffness and force.",1993,"D Maughan, J Molloy, A Kreuz, T Tansey, R Miller"
"Cytogenetical localization of Zygotic hybrid rescue (Zhr), a Drosophila melanogaster gene that rescues interspecific hybrids from embryonic lethality",8316215,10.1007/BF00276943,"Hybrid females from crosses between Drsophila melanogaster males and females of its sibling species, D. simulans, D. mauritiana, or D. sechellia die as embryos.

Zygotic hybrid rescue (Zhr) prevents this embryonic lethality and has been cytogenetically mapped to a proximal region of the X chromosome of D. melanogaster, probably in the centromeric heterochromatin. We have carried out high resolution cytological mapping of Zhr using deficiencies and duplications of the X heterochromatin. Deletions of the Zhr+ gene from the hybrid genome exhibit the Zhr phenotype. On the contrary, addition of the wild-type gene to the hybrid genome causes embryonic lethality, regardless of sex.

As revealed by sequential immunostaining, PEP is found on a subset of chromosomal sites bound by the HRB (heterogeneous nuclear RNA-binding) proteins, which are basic Drosophila hnRNPs.

Banding patterns were highly polymorphic. jockey did not, however, hybridize with any strains of the Asian honeybee (A. cerana). G elements showed a faint signal with the Asian honeybee, but not with any other insects tested.

Molecular characterization of the lethal of scute genetic function,8076513,,"The lethal of scute (l'sc) genetic function, which plays an essential role in the early development of the central nervous system of the Drosophila embryo, is localized within the achaete-scute complex (AS-C). Several lines of evidence have suggested that the AS-C T3 transcription unit corresponds to the l'sc function. We demonstrate that short fragments of DNA, containing the T3 transcribed region and a few kilobases of flanking sequences, rescue, albeit partially, the lethality and neural phenotype of l'sc deletions. Still, the complex wild-type pattern of expression of T3 is not reproduced by the transduced genes. This depends on cis-control elements scattered within the entire AS-C DNA and intermingled with regulatory elements specific for other AS-C transcription units. These elements are necessary for the initial activation of T3 in the neuroectoderm, probably mediated by axis-patterning genes. The presence of a cluster of E-boxes, upstream of the T3 transcribed region, suggests another level of control of T3 expression by basic-helix-loop-helix proteins, among them its own gene product.",1993,"S Romani, M D Martín-Bermudo, F González, I Rodríguez, F Jiménez, M Ruiz-Gómez, J Modolell, M Domínguez"
A cladistic analysis of phenotypic associations with haplotypes inferred from restriction endonuclease mapping. IV. Nested analyses with cladogram uncertainty and recombination,8100789,,"We previously developed an analytical strategy based on cladistic theory to identify subsets of haplotypes that are associated with significant phenotypic deviations. Our initial approach was limited to segments of DNA in which little recombination occurs. In such cases, a cladogram can be constructed from the restriction site data to estimate the evolutionary steps that interrelate the observed haplotypes to one another. The cladogram is then used to define a nested statistical design for identifying mutational steps associated with significant phenotypic deviations. The central assumption behind this strategy is that a mutation responsible for a particular phenotypic effect is embedded within the evolutionary history that is represented by the cladogram. The power of this approach depends on the accuracy of the cladogram in portraying the evolutionary history of the DNA region. This accuracy can be diminished both by recombination and by uncertainty in the estimated cladogram topology. In a previous paper, we presented an algorithm for estimating the set of likely claodgrams and recombination events. In this paper we present an algorithm for defining a nested statistical design under cladogram uncertainty and recombination. Given the nested design, phenotypic associations can be examined using either a nested analysis of variance (for haploids or homozygous strains) or permutation testing (for outcrossed, diploid gene regions). In this paper we also extend this analytical strategy to include categorical phenotypes in addition to quantitative phenotypes. Some worked examples are presented using Drosophila data sets. These examples illustrate that having some recombination may actually enhance the biological inferences that may derived from a cladistic analysis. In particular, recombination can be used to assign a physical localization to a given subregion for mutations responsible for significant phenotypic effects.",1993,"C F Sing, A R Templeton"

Otherwise the structure and predicted protein are very similar to those of other species. (2) There is a significant shift in codon usage, especially compared with that in D. melanogaster Adh. The most striking shift is from C to U in the wobble position (both third and first position). Unlike the codon-usage-bias pattern typical of highly biased genes in D. melanogaster, including Adh, D. willistoni has nearly 50% G + C in the third position.

A short 5'-flanking region mediates glucose repression of amylase gene expression in Drosophila melanogaster,8325486,,"Expression of the alpha-amylase gene is highly repressed by dietary glucose in Drosophila melanogaster larvae. Here, we show that glucose repression is controlled by DNA sequences that are located upstream of the transcribed region. Recombinant gene constructions, in which the amylase promoter sequences were fused with the transcribed region of the Adh gene, were expressed in transgenic Drosophila larvae. The expression of ADH from the recombinant gene was shown to be subject to glucose repression. The function of potential regulatory cis-acting elements within the glucose responsive upstream region was examined by deletion analysis and by site-directed mutagenesis, coupled with expression assays in transformed larvae. The upstream deletion analysis showed that essential elements, both for overall activity and for glucose repression of the amylase gene, are located within a 109-bp region upstream of the transcription start site. Site-directed mutagenesis of these upstream sequences showed that the TATA motif, at position -31, and a novel 36-bp element, at position -109, were necessary for full activity of the amylase promoter. None of the introduced mutations resulted in loss of glucose responsiveness. These results indicate that glucose repression, in Drosophila, is mediated by transcriptional mechanisms that involve multiple, functionally redundant DNA elements.",1993,"B Benkel, A Loverre-Chyurlia, L Bally-Cuif, C Magoulas, D Hickey"

Nevertheless, polarographic determinations of substrate oxidation show activity of complex I to be reduced by 30%. In contrast, complex III activity is similar to that measured in the wild strain.

"Analysis of a genetic hitchhiking model, and its application to DNA polymorphism data from Drosophila melanogaster",8355603,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a040046,"Begun and Aquadro have demonstrated that levels of nucleotide variation correlate with recombination rate among 20 gene regions from across the genome of Drosophila melanogaster. It has been suggested that this correlation results from genetic hitchhiking associated with the fixation of strongly selected mutants. The hitchhiking process can be described as a series of two-step events. The first step consists of a strongly selected substitution wiping out linked variation in a population; this is followed by a recovery period in which polymorphism can build up via neutral mutations and random genetic drift. Genetic hitchhiking has previously been modeled as a steady-state process driven by recurring selected substitutions. We show here that the characteristic parameter of this steady-state model is alpha v, the product of selection intensity (alpha = 2Ns) and the frequency of beneficial mutations v (where N is population size and s is the selective advantage of the favored allele). We also demonstrate that the steady-state model describes the hitchhiking process adequately, unless the recombination rate is very low. To estimate alpha v, we use the data of DNA sequence variation from 17 D. melanogaster loci from regions of intermediate to high recombination rates. We find that alpha v is likely to be > 1.3 x 10(-8). Additional data are needed to estimate this parameter more precisely. The estimation of alpha v is important, as this parameter determines the shape of the frequency distribution of strongly selected substitutions.",1993,"W Stephan, T H Wiehe"
In vivo effect of Neuropeptide F on ecdysteroidogenesis in adult female desert locusts (Schistocerca gregaria),23524065,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2013.03.005,"Neuropeptides are important regulatory factors that mediate key life processes, both in vertebrates and invertebrates. Many insect neuropeptides display pleiotropic activities, which means that they can influence multiple aspects of insect physiology. In the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, Neuropeptide F (NPF) mediates diverse physiological processes, such as learning, stress responses, feeding and male courtship behavior. In locusts, only a truncated form of the predicted ""full-length"" NPF, the nonapeptide ""trNPF"", has been isolated. This nonapeptide previously proved to be biologically active, since it was shown to influence food intake and weight increase, as well as oocyte growth in adult female desert locusts (Schistocerca gregaria [Forskål]). In the present study, we have further analyzed the effect of trNPF on female reproductive physiology in S. gregaria. We confirmed that daily trNPF injections in adult females elicit an increase of oocyte size. In addition, an RNAi-mediated knockdown of the Schgr-NPF precursor transcript in adult female locusts resulted in the opposite effect, i.e. significantly smaller oocytes. Moreover, we discovered that daily injections of trNPF in adult female S. gregaria, caused higher ecdysteroid titers in the ovaries and accelerated the appearance of ecdysteroid peaks in the hemolymph of these animals. The RNAi-based knockdown of the Schgr-NPF precursor transcript clearly resulted in reduction of both hemolymph and ovarian ecdysteroid concentrations, confirming the stimulatory effects of trNPF injections on adult female ecdysteroid levels.

Whole-genome sequencing of two North American Drosophila melanogaster populations reveals genetic differentiation and positive selection,24102956,10.1111/mec.12468,"The prevailing demographic model for Drosophila melanogaster suggests that the colonization of North America occurred very recently from a subset of European flies that rapidly expanded across the continent. This model implies a sudden population growth and range expansion consistent with very low or no population subdivision. As flies adapt to new environments, local adaptation events may be expected. To describe demographic and selective events during North American colonization, we have generated a data set of 35 individual whole-genome sequences from inbred lines of D. melanogaster from a west coast US population (Winters, California, USA) and compared them with a public genome data set from Raleigh (Raleigh, North Carolina, USA). We analysed nuclear and mitochondrial genomes and described levels of variation and divergence within and between these two North American D. melanogaster populations. Both populations exhibit negative values of Tajima's D across the genome, a common signature of demographic expansion. We also detected a low but significant level of genome-wide differentiation between the two populations, as well as multiple allele surfing events, which can be the result of gene drift in local subpopulations on the edge of an expansion wave. In contrast to this genome-wide pattern, we uncovered a 50-kilobase segment in chromosome arm 3L that showed all the hallmarks of a soft selective sweep in both populations. A comparison of allele frequencies within this divergent region among six populations from three continents allowed us to cluster these populations in two differentiated groups, providing evidence for the action of natural selection on a global scale.",2013,"C Fjeldsted, T Souaiaia, K Lehmann, J Kao, S V Nuzhdin, D Campo"

Recent studies in multiple model organisms suggest that Wnd/DLK regulates both regenerative and degenerative responses to axonal injury. Here we report a new role for Wnd in regulating synaptic structure during development, which implies that Wnd is also active in uninjured neurons. This synaptic role of Wnd can be functionally separated from the role of Wnd in axonal regeneration and injury signaling by the requirement for the JIP1 scaffold and the p38b MAP kinase. JIP1 mediates the synaptic function of Wnd via p38, which is not required for injury signaling or new axonal growth after injury. Our results indicate that Wnd regulates multiple independent pathways in Drosophila motoneurons and that JIP1 scaffolds a specific downstream cascade required for the organization of presynaptic microtubules during synaptic development.",2013,"Catherine A Collins, Xin Xiong, Xin Wang, Susan Klinedinst, Jill M Haenfler"
Control of germline stem cell self-renewal and differentiation in the Drosophila ovary: concerted actions of niche signals and intrinsic factors,24009036,10.1002/wdev.60,"In the Drosophila ovary, germline stem cells (GSCs) physically interact with their niche composed of terminal filament cells, cap cells, and possibly GSC-contacting escort cells (ECs). A GSC divides to generate a self-renewing stem cell that remains in the niche and a differentiating daughter that moves away from the niche. The GSC niche provides a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signal that maintains GSC self-renewal by preventing stem cell differentiation via repression of the differentiation-promoting gene bag of marbles (bam). In addition, it expresses E-cadherin, which mediates cell adhesion for anchoring GSCs in the niche, enabling continuous self-renewal. GSCs themselves also express different classes of intrinsic factors, including signal transducers, transcription factors, chromatin remodeling factors, translation regulators, and miRNAs, which control self-renewal by strengthening interactions with the niche and repressing various differentiation pathways. Differentiated GSC daughters, known as cystoblasts (CBs), also express distinct classes of intrinsic factors to inhibit self-renewal and promote germ cell differentiation. Surprisingly, GSC progeny are also dependent on their surrounding ECs for proper differentiation at least partly by preventing BMP from diffusing to the differentiated germ cell zone and by repressing ectopic BMP expression. Therefore, both GSC self-renewal and CB differentiation are controlled by collaborative actions of extrinsic signals and intrinsic factors.",2013,Ting Xie

Regulation of sleep by neuropeptide Y-like system in Drosophila melanogaster,24040211,10.1371/journal.pone.0074237,"Sleep is important for maintenance of normal physiology in animals. In mammals, neuropeptide Y (NPY), a homolog of Drosophila neuropeptide F (NPF), is involved in sleep regulation, with different effects in human and rat. However, the function of NPF on sleep in Drosophila melanogaster has not yet been described. In this study, we investigated the effects of NPF and its receptor-neuropeptide F receptor (NPFR1) on Drosophila sleep. Male flies over-expressing NPF or NPFR1 exhibited increased sleep during the nighttime. Further analysis demonstrated that sleep episode duration during nighttime was greatly increased and sleep latency was significantly reduced, indicating that NPF and NPFR1 promote sleep quality, and their action on sleep is not because of an impact of the NPF signal system on development. Moreover, the homeostatic regulation of flies after sleep deprivation was disrupted by altered NPF signaling, since sleep deprivation decreased transcription of NPF in control flies, and there were less sleep loss during sleep deprivation and less sleep gain after sleep deprivation in flies overexpressing NPF and NPFR1 than in control flies, suggesting that NPF system auto-regulation plays an important role in sleep homeostasis. However, these effects did not occur in females, suggesting a sex-dependent regulatory function in sleep for NPF and NPFR1. NPF in D1 brain neurons showed male-specific expression, providing the cellular locus for male-specific regulation of sleep by NPF and NPFR1. This study brings a new understanding into sleep studies of a sexually dimorphic regulatory mode in female and male flies.",2013,"Zhangwu Zhao, Chunxia He, Yunyan Yang, Mingming Zhang, Jeffrey L Price"

The transient receptor potential-like (TRPL) cation channel was a direct target for camphor in gustatory receptor neurons, and long-term feeding on a camphor diet led to reversible downregulation of TRPL protein concentrations. The turnover of TRPL was controlled by an E3 ubiquitin ligase, Ube3a. The decline in TRPL levels and increased acceptance of camphor reversed after returning the flies to a camphor-free diet long term.

In the genetic model Drosophila melanogaster, FGF signalling via the receptor tyrosine kinases Heartless (Htl) and Breathless (Btl) is particularly well studied. These FGF receptors affect gene expression, cell shape and cell-cell interactions during mesoderm layer formation, caudal visceral muscle (CVM) formation, tracheal morphogenesis and glia differentiation. Here, we will address the current knowledge of the biological functions of FGF signalling in the fly on the tissue, at a cellular and molecular level.",2013,"Villö Muha, Hans-Arno J Müller"
Paternal transmission of mitochondrial DNA as an integral part of mitochondrial inheritance in metapopulations of Drosophila simulans,23010820,10.1038/hdy.2012.60,"Maternal inheritance is one of the hallmarks of animal mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and central to its success as a molecular marker. This mode of inheritance and subsequent lack of heterologous recombination allows us to retrace evolutionary relationships unambiguously down the matriline and without the confounding effects of recombinant genetic information. Accumulating evidence of biparental inheritance of mtDNA (paternal leakage), however, challenges our current understanding of how this molecule is inherited. Here, using Drosophila simulans collected from an East African metapopulation exhibiting recurring mitochondrial heteroplasmy, we conducted single fly matings and screened F1 offspring for the presence of paternal mtDNA using allele-specific PCR assays (AS-PCR). In all, 27 out of 4092 offspring were identified as harboring paternal mtDNA, suggesting a frequency of 0.66% paternal leakage in this species. Our findings strongly suggest that recurring mtDNA heteroplasmy as observed in natural populations of Drosophila simulans is most likely caused by repeated paternal leakage. Our findings further suggest that this phenomenon to potentially be an integral part of mtDNA inheritance in these populations and consequently of significance for mtDNA as a molecular marker.",2013,"J W O Ballard, J N Wolff, M Nafisinia, P Sutovsky"
Evolution of three parent genes and their retrogene copies in Drosophila species,23841016,10.1155/2013/693085,"Retrogenes form a class of gene duplicate lacking the regulatory sequences found outside of the mRNA-coding regions of the parent gene. It is not clear how a retrogene's lack of parental regulatory sequences affects the evolution of the gene pair. To explore the evolution of parent genes and retrogenes, we investigated three such gene pairs in the family Drosophilidae; in Drosophila melanogaster, these gene pairs are CG8331 and CG4960, CG17734 and CG11825, and Sep2 and Sep5. We investigated the embryonic expression patterns of these gene pairs across multiple Drosophila species. Expression patterns of the parent genes and their single copy orthologs are relatively conserved across species, whether or not a species has a retrogene copy, although there is some variation in CG8331 and CG17734. In contrast, expression patterns of the retrogene orthologs have diversified. We used the genome sequences of 20 Drosophila species to investigate coding sequence evolution. The coding sequences of the three gene pairs appear to be evolving predominantly under negative selection; however, the parent genes and retrogenes show some distinct differences in amino acid sequence. Therefore, in general, retrogene expression patterns and coding sequences are distinct compared to their parents and, in some cases, retrogene expression patterns diversify.",2013,"Denise V Clark, Ryan S O'Neill"

Polar substitutions in helix 3 of the prion protein produce transmembrane isoforms that disturb vesicle trafficking,23771030,10.1093/hmg/ddt276,"Prion diseases encompass a diverse group of neurodegenerative conditions characterized by the accumulation of misfolded prion protein (PrP) isoforms. Other conformational variants of PrP have also been proposed to contribute to neurotoxicity in prion diseases, including misfolded intermediates as well as cytosolic and transmembrane isoforms. To better understand PrP neurotoxicity, we analyzed the role of two highly conserved methionines in helix 3 on PrP biogenesis, folding and pathogenesis. Expression of the PrP-M205S and -M205,212S mutants in Drosophila led to hyperglycosylation, intracellular accumulation and widespread conformational changes due to failure of oxidative folding. Surprisingly, PrP-M205S and -M205,212S acquired a transmembrane topology (Ctm) previously linked to mutations in the signal peptide (SP) and the transmembrane domain (TMD). PrP-M205,212S also disrupted the accumulation of key neurodevelopmental proteins in lipid rafts, resulting in shortened axonal projections. These results uncover a new role for the hydrophobic domain in promoting oxidative folding and preventing the formation of neurotoxic Ctm PrP, mechanisms that may be relevant in the pathogenesis of both inherited and sporadic prion diseases.",2013,"Pedro Fernandez-Funez, Daniela Arbelaez, Kurt Jensen, Diego E Rincon-Limas, Jonatan Sanchez-Garcia"

Kinesin-5/Eg5 is important for transport of CARTS from the trans-Golgi network to the cell surface,23857769,10.1083/jcb.201303163,"Here we report that the kinesin-5 motor Klp61F, which is known for its role in bipolar spindle formation in mitosis, is required for protein transport from the Golgi complex to the cell surface in Drosophila S2 cells. Disrupting the function of its mammalian orthologue, Eg5, in HeLa cells inhibited secretion of a protein called pancreatic adenocarcinoma up-regulated factor (PAUF) but, surprisingly, not the trafficking of vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSV-G) to the cell surface. We have previously reported that PAUF is transported from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to the cell surface in specific carriers called CARTS that exclude VSV-G. Inhibition of Eg5 function did not affect the biogenesis of CARTS; however, their migration was delayed and they accumulated near the Golgi complex. Altogether, our findings reveal a surprising new role of Eg5 in nonmitotic cells in the facilitation of the transport of specific carriers, CARTS, from the TGN to the cell surface.",2013,"David Cruz-Garcia, Julien Villeneuve, Mitsuo Tagaya, Yuichi Wakana, Josse van Galen, Vivek Malhotra"

Despite having a reduced genome, the arthropod strains of the alphaproteobacterium Wolbachia contain an unusually high number of ankyrin repeat domain-encoding genes ranging from 23 in wMel to 60 in wPip strain. This group of genes has attracted considerable attention for their astonishing large number as well as for the fact that ankyrin proteins are known to participate in protein-protein interactions, suggesting that they play a critical role in the molecular mechanism that determines host-Wolbachia symbiotic interactions. We present a comparative evolutionary analysis of the wMel-related ankyrin repeat domain-encoding genes present in different Drosophila-Wolbachia associations. Our results show that the ankyrin repeat domain-encoding genes change in size by expansion and contraction mediated by short directly repeated sequences. We provide examples of intra-genic recombination events and show that these genes are likely to be horizontally transferred between strains with the aid of bacteriophages. These results confirm previous findings that the Wolbachia genomes are evolutionary mosaics and illustrate the potential that these bacteria have to generate diversity in proteins potentially involved in the symbiotic interactions.",2013,"Lisa Klasson, Siv G E Andersson, Henk R Braig, Panagiotis Ioannidis, Stefanos Siozios, Kostas Bourtzis"
RNA binding mediates neurotoxicity in the transgenic Drosophila model of TDP-43 proteinopathy,23804749,10.1093/hmg/ddt296,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive and selective loss of motor neurons. The discovery of mutations in the gene encoding an RNA-binding protein, TAR DNA-binding protein of 43 kD (TDP-43), in familial ALS, strongly implicated abnormalities in RNA processing in the pathogenesis of ALS, although the mechanisms whereby TDP-43 leads to neurodegeneration remain elusive. To clarify the mechanism of degeneration caused by TDP-43, we generated transgenic Drosophila melanogaster expressing a series of systematically modified human TDP-43 genes in the retinal photoreceptor neurons. Overexpression of wild-type TDP-43 resulted in vacuolar degeneration of the photoreceptor neurons associated with thinning of the retina, which was significantly exacerbated by mutations of TDP-43 linked to familial ALS or disrupting its nuclear localization signal (NLS). Remarkably, these degenerative phenotypes were completely normalized by addition of a mutation or deletion of the RNA recognition motif that abolishes the RNA binding ability of TDP-43. Altogether, our results suggest that RNA binding is key to the neurodegeneration caused by overexpression of TDP-43, and that abnormalities in RNA processing may be crucial to the pathogenesis of TDP-43 proteinopathy.",2013,"Koji Matsukawa, Takeshi Iwatsubo, Shoji Tsuji, Erina Kuranaga, Hayato Kunugi, Ryoko Ihara, Takahiro Chihara, Tomoko Wakabayashi, Yusei Nagata, Tadafumi Hashimoto, Masayuki Miura"
Fine-scale heterogeneity in crossover rate in the garnet-scalloped region of the Drosophila melanogaster X chromosome,23410829,10.1534/genetics.112.146746,"Homologous recombination affects myriad aspects of genome evolution, from standing levels of nucleotide diversity to the efficacy of natural selection. Rates of crossing over show marked variability at all scales surveyed, including species-, population-, and individual-level differences. Even within genomes, crossovers are nonrandomly distributed in a wide diversity of taxa. Although intra- and intergenomic heterogeneities in crossover distribution have been documented in Drosophila, the scale and degree of crossover rate heterogeneity remain unclear. In addition, the genetic features mediating this heterogeneity are unknown. Here we quantify fine-scale heterogeneity in crossover distribution in a 2.1-Mb region of the Drosophila melanogaster X chromosome by localizing crossover breakpoints in 2500 individuals, each containing a single crossover in this specific X chromosome region. We show 90-fold variation in rates of crossing over at a 5-kb scale, place this variation in the context of several aspects of genome evolution, and identify several genetic features associated with crossover rates.

All Manduca tissues examined showed putative G beta subunits of 37 and 38 kDa, an unidentified alpha subunit of 41 kDa, in addition to an eye specific alpha subunit of 42 kDa. Manduca tissues also produced putative Gs alpha subunits of 48 and 51 kDa which were coupled to prothoracic gland adenylate cyclase as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation. Prothoracic gland G proteins have a definite and limited quaternary structure, consistent with a heterotrimeric model, as demonstrated by crosslinking of prothoracic gland membrane preparations followed by immunoblotting. These studies also yielded data on relative titers of alpha subunits, and suggest that Gs alpha is present in lower amounts than other alpha subunits.

The species Drosophila hawaiiensis was found to be polymorphic for two/three vitellogenin bands and, also, polymorphic with respect to the size of the V1 protein. No inter- or intrapopulation variability in vitellogenin size was detected in 10 other species examined.

Proneural clusters: equivalence groups in the epithelium of Drosophila,2088728,,"The segregation of neural precursors from epidermal cells during development of the nervous system of Drosophila relies on interactions between cells that are thought to be initially equivalent. During development of the adult peripheral nervous system, failure of the cellular interactions leads to the differentiation of a tuft of sensory bristles at the site where usually only one develops. It is thus thought that a group of cells at that site (a proneural cluster) has the potential to make a bristle but that in normal development only one cell will do so. The question addressed here is do these cells constitute an equivalence group (Kimble, J., Sulston, J. and White, J. (1979). In Cell Lineage, Stem Cells and Cell Determination (ed. N. Le Douarin). Inserm Symposium No. 10 pp. 59-68, Elsevier, Amsterdam)? Within clusters mutant for shaggy, where several cells of a cluster follow the neural fate and differentiate bristles, it is shown that these display identical neuronal specificity: stimulation of the bristles evoke the same leg cleaning response and backfilling of single neurons reveal similar axonal projections in the central nervous system.

"Optimization, constraint, and history in the evolution of eyes",2146698,10.1086/416840,"Several features of the evolution of eyes and photoreceptors are examined in an effort to explore the relative roles of adaptation and historical and developmental constraints. Optical design shows clear evidence of adaptation, which in some respects approaches optima predictable from physics. The primate fovea, on the other hand, illustrates how adaptation can be channeled by developmental heritage. The primary structures of opsins reveal multiple evolutionary lineages within both Drosophila and humans. The pigments of vertebrae rods comprise a subset of opsins whose evolutionary relationships map onto the phylogeny of the parent species. The evolutionary reasons for why most rod pigments absorb maximally at 500 +/- 10 nm are obscure, as there is no convincing explanation based on adaptation alone. Rods are appropriately distinguished from cones on the basis of which opsin gene is expressed. This criterion is likely to be in conflict with other definitions in phyletic lines (e.g., geckos, snakes) that have long diurnal or nocturnal histories accompanied by loss of one or more opsin genes, followed by a secondary adaptation to life in a different photic environment. Color vision--a generalizable perception associated with the spectral composition of light--is usefully distinguished from wavelength-specific behaviors. The latter are also based on multiple visual pigments and more than one spectral class of receptors but cannot be altered by learning. The distinction is particularly forceful in bees, which exhibit both kinds of behavior. The evolution of primate color vision has been shaped by historical factors involving an extensive period of early mammalian nocturnality. Birds, by contrast, have more elaborate cones and a richer set of visual pigments. Avian color space can be represented in a tetrahedron.",1990,T H Goldsmith
A methodological constraint influencing measurement of food intake rates in sucking predators,28311485,10.1007/BF00319803,"In a number of studies which provide food extraction curves for sucking predators, data were obtained by separating the predator from the prey (i.e. by artificially interrupting feeding) at predetermined intervals within the total feeding time. The amount of food the predator had extracted at these time intervals was then determined by measuring either the mass gain in the predator or the mass loss in the prey. An implicit assumption of this method is that at the time feeding is interrupted, the food extracted by the predator is contained within its own digestive system and no part of the food has been released back into the prey. I found this was not the case with the crab spider Diaea sp. indet. feeding on the fruit fly Drosophila immigrans. The food Diaea extracts from prey is retained in its own digestive system only at times when the spider changes feeding sites on the prey and when it discards the prey when finished feeding. At other times it cycles the extracted food between itself and the prey (i.e. a sucking phase is alternated with a relaxing phase during which the extracted food is released back into the prey). Unless feeding is interrupted as close as possible to the end of the sucking phase, the mass change measured in the spider will be an underestimate of the actual amount of food extracted at this time. My results suggest that understanding how a sucking predator's feeding mechanism affects the transfer of food is necessary, not only in identifying constraints affecting feeding efficiency, but also in identifying how these constraints relate to the design of empirical tests. The precision of these tests will, in part, reflect the degree to which these mechanisms are incorporated into the test design.",1990,Simon D Pollard
Asymmetrically distributed ecdysteroid-related antigens in follicles and young embryos of Drosophila melanogaster,28305668,10.1007/BF00377396,"We have produced monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against an antigen that is asymmetrically distributed in mature oocytes of Drosophila melanogaster. During late oogenesis and early embryogenesis the antigen undergoes dramatic changes in its cellular localization: until about 2.5 h before completion of oogenesis it is homogeneously distributed in the cytoplasm, then it becomes localized in granules that are more numerous in posterior than in anterior peripheral positions of the ooplasm. The germ plasm is void of the antigen. Shortly after egg deposition the antigen is released from the granules and forms a shallow temporary gradient in the egg. Later during embryogenesis the antigen is associated with the yolk-containing cytoplasm. At the syncytial blastoderm stage it is also detected in the peripheral nuclei. Preliminary evidence suggests that the antigen is an ecdysteroid-related molecule. Five different anti-ecdysone antisera were found to bind to the same antigen or to an antigen with the same localization as our monoclonal antibody. In pattern mutants affecting anteroposterior polarity, the described asymmetrical distribution of the antigen is abnormal. In the mutant BicD, for example, which leads to the formation of two abdomina of opposite polarity, the antigen-containing granules are distributed homogeneously in mature oocytes.",1990,"Veronika Grau, Herwig O Gutzeit"

Herein we report the identification and characterization of a developmentally regulated 3.8 kb vg transcript which is spliced from exons distributed throughout the essential interval defined above. All the characterized classical alleles have predictable effects on this transcription unit, and the severity of this effect is directly proportional to the severity of the wing phenotype. A repetitive domain within this transcription unit was identified and may serve as a tag to isolate other genes with functions related to vg. We also report an exceptional vg allele (vg83b27) that produces an extreme wing and haltere phenotype, but which defines a second vg complementation unit. This allele is associated with a 4 kb deletion entirely within a 4.5 kb vg intron as defined by the 3.8 kb transcription unit.

Components of positional information in the developing wing margin of the Lyra mutant of Drosophila,28305672,10.1007/BF00399055,"A number of parameters characteristic of the wing margin precursor in imaginal discs of Drosophila are known: the zone of non-proliferating cells or ZNC (O'Brochta and Bryant 1985), aldehyde oxidase (AO) and other enzyme staining patterns (Sprey et al. 1982), E1C antigen localization in a narrow band along the margin (Piovant and Lena 1988). To test our hypothesis that such parameters, and others, act in concert to determine margin identity and the positional information that specifies the bristles and hairs appropriate to the anterior, posterior and distal margins, we have examined these parameters in the dominant mutant Lyra, in which much of the anterior and posterior margins is missing. After establishing that Lyra phenotype is already evident in the early pupal wing, we tested the known imaginal disc parameters and found that only Mab E1C (Piovant and Lena 1988) distribution differs from wild type, suggesting that E1C antigen may be a component of positional information. Sibatani's (1983) model for specification of positional information (PI) applied to wing discs predicts the Lyra adult wing shape as well as the reduced distribution of E1C antigen in Lyra wing discs. The model is based on the assumption that specification of positional information depends on interactions of multiple, independent factors.

The isozyme-specific carboxyl-terminal amino acids are encoded by one of three alternatively utilized fourth exons: 4A, 4B, or 4C by alternative splicing. The transcript containing exon 4C, whose sequence has been reported previously, is abundant throughout development and has a developmental profile similar to other glycolytic gene transcripts; however, it shows developmental specificity in the alternative use of two polyadenylation signals which result in a 2.4-kilobase and a 1.9-kilobase transcript. The transcript containing exon 4B is 1.6 kilobases in size and is most abundant during the larval stages and during the time of eclosion. The transcript containing exon 4A is in low abundance and found only during the adult stage. Sequence comparisons of the alternative fourth exons indicate that the duplication leading to the multiple exons is quite old and preceded the origin of the genus Drosophila.",1992,"D T Sullivan, J L Lissemore, D R Tolan, R Shaw-Lee"
P element transposition in vitro proceeds by a cut-and-paste mechanism and uses GTP as a cofactor,1313335,10.1016/0092-8674(92)90116-t,"We have developed an in vitro reaction system for Drosophila P element transposition. Transposition products were recovered by selection in E. coli, and contained simple P element insertions flanked by 8 bp target site duplications as observed in vivo. Transposition required Mg+2 and partially purified P element transposase. Unlike other DNA rearrangement reactions, P element transposition in vitro used GTP as a cofactor; deoxyGTP, dideoxyGTP, or the nonhydrolyzable GTP analogs GMP-PNP or GMP-PCP were also used. Transposon DNA molecules cleaved at the P element termini were able to transpose, but those lacking 3'-hydroxyl groups were inactive. These biochemical data are consistent with genetic data suggesting that P element transposition occurs via a ""cut-and-paste"" mechanism.",1992,"D C Rio, P D Kaufman"
"A comprehensive study of genic variation in natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster. VI. Patterns and processes of genic divergence between D. melanogaster and its sibling species, Drosophila simulans",1582561,,"We present here an extensive set of data on allelic differences between homologous proteins of Drosophila melanogaster and its sibling species, Drosophila simulans, obtained by nondenaturing one-dimensional, and denaturing two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The data suggest that, for these two species, (1) approximately 10% of protein-coding loci have no alleles in common in our sample, (2) the extent of genic variation at a locus (mean heterozygosity) within a species is not correlated with the extent of divergence (Nei's genetic distance) at that locus between species, and (3) significant heterogeneity of divergence rates exists for different structural/functional classes of loci. These results are discussed in the context of the dynamics of genetic variation within and between species.",1992,"M Choudhary, M B Coulthart, R S Singh"
Autocatalysis and phenotypic expression of Drosophila homeotic gene Deformed: its dependence on polarity and homeotic gene function,1363540,,"Previously published experiments have shown that the endogenous Dfd gene can be ectopically activated by its own (heat-shock-driven) product in a subset of cells of different segments. This results in the differentiation of maxillary structures like cirri and mouth hooks in places where they normally do not appear, and represents a phenomenon of autocatalysis of homeotic gene function that differs from the normal activation process. We show that this out-of-context activation occurs in cells belonging to the anterior compartments of the three thoracic and the A1 to A8 abdominal segments and that it requires the normal function of the polarity genes wingless (wg) and engrailed (en). The wg product, in addition to that of Dfd, appears to be sufficient to activate the endogenous Dfd gene in many embryonic cells. We have studied the effect of several homeotic genes on Dfd activation and phenotypic expression: Scr, Antp, Ubx and Abd-B repress Dfd both transcriptionally and at the phenotypic level, if their products are in sufficient amounts. The endogenous abd-A gene does not have a noticeable effect, but when it is replaced by an hsp70-abd-A gene, which produces a high and uniform level of expression, the phenotypic expression of Dfd is suppressed. Our results also suggest that the differentiation of cirri is induced by Dfd-expressing cells in non-expressing neighboring cells, and that this interaction occurs across the parasegmental border.",1992,"G Morata, A Macías, A González-Reyes"
Molecular analysis of mutations induced in the vermilion gene of Drosophila melanogaster by methyl methanesulfonate,1628810,,"The nature of DNA sequence changes induced by methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) at the vermilion locus of Drosophila melanogaster was determined after exposure of postmeiotic male germ cell stages. MMS is a carcinogen with strong preference for base nitrogen alkylation (s = 0.86). The spectrum of 40 intralocus mutations was dominated by AT----GC transitions (23%), AT----TA transversions (54%) and deletions (14%). The small deletions were preferentially found among mutants isolated in the F1 (8/18), whereas the AT----GC transitions exclusively occurred in the F2 (6/22). The MMS-induced transversions and deletions are presumably caused by N-methyl DNA adducts, which may release apurinic intermediates, known to be a time-related process. Furthermore, MMS produces multilocus deletions, i.e., at least 30% of the F1 mutants analyzed were of this type. A comparison of the mutational spectra of MMS with that produced by ethylnitrosourea (ENU), also in the vermilion locus of Drosophila, reveals major differences: predominantly transition mutations (61% GC----AT and 18% AT----GC) were found in both the F1 and F2 spectrum induced by ENU. It is concluded that the mutational spectrum of MMS is dominated by nitrogen DNA adducts, whereas with ENU DNA sequence changes mainly arose from modified oxygen in DNA.",1992,"A Pastink, E W Vogel, M J Nivard"
Partner choice in heterologous chromosome segregation of the Y chromosome in competitive situations in the oocyte of Drosophila melanogaster,1624136,10.1007/BF00120320,"Heterologous segregation of the Y chromosome and secondary non-disjunction of the X chromosomes in female meiosis of Drosophila melanogaster was investigated in ten different crosses where different constellations of translocation/inversion or translocation/translocation systems of the large autosomes were present in the female parent. It appeared that the Y chromosome always segregates from the shortest of the possible heterologous pairing partners. This may be due to size-dependent mechanism of so-called 'distributive disjunction' or to the possibility that the shorter the chromosome element is, the more easily it moves in the nucleus of the oocyte. Secondary non-disjunction of the X chromosomes appeared to be lower the more possible autosomal pairing partners the Y chromosome had, suggesting that the autosomes effectively compete with the X chromosomes for pairing with the Y chromosome. An alternative explanation is that, due to interchromosomal effect on recombination, crossing over in the X chromosomes was different in different experiments.",1992,P Portin
Increased levels of the Drosophila Abelson tyrosine kinase in nerves and muscles: subcellular localization and mutant phenotypes imply a role in cell-cell interactions,1295746,,"Mutations in the Drosophila Abelson tyrosine kinase have pleiotropic effects late in development that lead to pupal lethality or adults with a reduced life span, reduced fecundity and rough eyes. We have examined the expression of the abl protein throughout embryonic and pupal development and analyzed mutant phenotypes in some of the tissues expressing abl. abl protein, present in all cells of the early embryo as the product of maternally contributed mRNA, transiently localizes to the region below the plasma membrane cleavage furrows as cellularization initiates. The function of this expression is not yet known. Zygotic expression of abl is first detected in the post-mitotic cells of the developing muscles and nervous system midway through embryogenesis. In later larval and pupal stages, abl protein levels are also highest in differentiating muscle and neural tissue including the photoreceptor cells of the eye. abl protein is localized subcellularly to the axons of the central nervous system, the embryonic somatic muscle attachment sites and the apical cell junctions of the imaginal disk epithelium. Evidence for abl function was obtained by analysis of mutant phenotypes in the embryonic somatic muscles and the eye imaginal disk. The expression patterns and mutant phenotypes indicate a role for abl in establishing and maintaining cell-cell interactions.",1992,"R L Bennett, F M Hoffmann"
"Mitochondrial transfer RNA genes in a black fly, Simulium vittatum (Diptera: Simuliidae), indicate long divergence from mosquito (Diptera: Culicidae) and fruit fly (Diptera: Drosophilidae)",1379642,10.1093/jmedent/29.4.644,"Sequences are given for nine complete genes and one partial mitochondrial tRNA gene of the black fly, Simulium vittatum (Zetterstedt).

Nucleotides were aligned with the same previously sequenced genes in Aedes albopictus Skuse and Drosophila yakuba Burla. A cluster of six tRNA genes, which differ in arrangement in Ae. albopictus and D. yakuba, was amplified by PCR and found to have the same position and orientation in S. vittatum as in D. yakuba. Overall, similarity with either D. yakuba or Ae. albopictus was 86%. Sequences that were common to the three insects suggest that black flies and mosquitoes are as divergent from each other as either is from Drosophila. Sequences for nine species of black flies were obtained for tRNA leucine(CUN) from DNA amplified with another primer set. Little variation occurred within the tRNA gene but, by including the flanking regions to provide 175 base pairs, a phylogeny of the nine species was obtained that was largely consistent with current classification.",1992,"T O Powers, K P Pruess, X Zhu"

Structure and expression of the Drosophila ubiquitin-52-amino-acid fusion-protein gene,1381584,10.1042/bj2860281,"Ubiquitin belongs to a multigene family. In Drosophila two members of this family have been previously described. We report here the organization and expression of a third member, the DUb52 gene, isolated by screening a Drosophila melanogaster genomic library. This gene encodes an ubiquitin monomer fused to a 52-amino acid extension protein. There are no introns interrupting the coding sequence. Recently, it has been described that this extension encodes a ribosomal protein in Saccharomyces, Dictyostelium, and Arabidopsis. The present results show that the 5' regulatory region of DUb52 shares common features with the ribosomal protein genes of Drosophila, Xenopus and mouse, including GC- and pyrimidine-rich regions. Moreover, sequences similar to the consensus Ribo-box in Neurospora crassa have been identified. Furthermore, a sequence has been found that is similar to the binding site for the TFIIIA distal element factor from Xenopus laevis. The DUb52 gene is transcribed to a 0.9 kb mRNA that is expressed constitutively throughout development and is particularly abundant in ovaries. In addition, the DUb52 gene has been found to be preferentially transcribed in exponentially growing Drosophila cells.",1992,"R Barrio, H L Cabrera, C Arribas"
A high-mobility-group protein and its cDNAs from Drosophila melanogaster,1373803,10.1128/mcb.12.5.1915,"We have identified, purified, and characterized a high-mobility-group (HMG) protein and its cDNAs from Drosophila melanogaster. This protein, HMG D, shares most of the characteristics of vertebrate HMG proteins; it is extractable from nuclei with 0.35 M NaCl, is soluble in 5% perchloric acid, is relatively small (molecular weight of 12,000), has both a high basic (24%) and high acidic (24%) amino acid content, and is a DNA-binding protein. HMG D exhibits characteristics of both the vertebrate HMG 1 and 2 class and the HMG 14 and 17 class of proteins. Its amino acid sequence is similar (36% amino acid identity) to that of HMG1, while its size and selective extraction with ethidium bromide are similar to properties of the HMG 14 and 17 class of proteins. HMG D is encoded by a single-copy gene that maps to 57F8-11 on the right arm of chromosome 2. Two transcripts are observed during embryogenesis; the protein is relatively stable throughout development. By the biochemical criteria of size, solubility, and amino acid content, HMG D appears to be the major HMG protein of D. melanogaster.",1992,"C R Wagner, K Hamana, S C Elgin"

Two independent 5 x 5 diallel crosses were carried out, each one with a different male tester genotype. Interactions between male and female genotypes were detected because some lines appeared as dominant in one diallel and recessive in the other. The overall picture emerging from the analyses shows a genetic system for female receptivity characterized by additive genes, with dominance for high receptivity in one of the diallel crosses. This remarkable additive component does not support the action of natural selection favouring females with extreme values of receptivity, rather, the lack of intrasexual female competition for mates is suggested.",1992,"R Piñeiro, E San Miguel, L Garcia-Florez, M C Carracedo, P Casares"
Molecular analysis of the deletion mutants in the E homeotic complex of the silkworm Bombyx mori,1352236,,"The E loci in Bombyx mori are expected to contain a homeotic gene complex specifying the identities of the larval abdominal segments. However, the molecular structure of this complex remains to be determined. We have started to analyze the structural changes in the E complex mutations. We used three newly isolated Bombyx homeobox genes as probes. These genes are probably homologues of the Ultrabithorax (Ubx), abdominal-A (abd-A) and Abdominal-B (Abd-B) in the Drosophila bithorax complex, because the amino-acid sequences of the homeobox regions in these Bombyx genes are almost identical to those of Drosophila genes. We found that the Bombyx Ubx and abd-A genes are deleted in the EN chromosome, and the Bombyx abd-A gene is deleted in the ECa chromosome. From these results, we conclude that the Bombyx E complex consists of the Ubx, abd-A and possibly Abd-B genes, which may play similar roles to their homologues in the Drosophila bithorax complex.",1992,"K Ueno, C C Hui, M Fukuta, Y Suzuki"
The mlpt/Ubr3/Svb module comprises an ancient developmental switch for embryonic patterning,30896406,10.7554/eLife.39748,"Small open reading frames (smORFs) encoding 'micropeptides' exhibit remarkable evolutionary complexity. Conserved peptides encoded by mille-pattes (mlpt)/polished rice (pri)/tarsal less (tal) are essential for embryo segmentation in Tribolium but, in Drosophila, function in terminal epidermal differentiation and patterning of adult legs. Here, we show that a molecular complex identified in Drosophila epidermal differentiation, comprising Mlpt peptides, ubiquitin-ligase Ubr3 and transcription factor Shavenbaby (Svb), represents an ancient developmental module required for early insect embryo patterning. We find that loss of segmentation function for this module in flies evolved concomitantly with restriction of Svb expression in early Drosophila embryos. Consistent with this observation, artificially restoring early Svb expression in flies causes segmentation defects that depend on mlpt function, demonstrating enduring potency of an ancestral developmental switch despite evolving embryonic patterning modes. These results highlight the evolutionary plasticity of conserved molecular complexes under the constraints of essential genetic networks.

sli is required for proper morphology and migration of sensory neurons in the Drosophila PNS,31651354,10.1186/s13064-019-0135-z,"Neurons and glial cells coordinate with each other in many different aspects of nervous system development. Both types of cells are receiving multiple guidance cues to guide the neurons and glial cells to their proper final position. The lateral chordotonal organs (lch5) of the Drosophila peripheral nervous system (PNS) are composed of five sensory neurons surrounded by four different glial cells, scolopale cells, cap cells, attachment cells and ligament cells. During embryogenesis, the lch5 neurons go through a rotation and ventral migration to reach their final position in the lateral region of the abdomen. We show here that the extracellular ligand sli is required for the proper ventral migration and morphology of the lch5 neurons. We further show that mutations in the Sli receptors Robo and Robo2 also display similar defects as loss of sli, suggesting a role for Slit-Robo signaling in lch5 migration and positioning. Additionally, we demonstrate that the scolopale, cap and attachment cells follow the mis-migrated lch5 neurons in sli mutants, while the ventral stretching of the ligament cells seems to be independent of the lch5 neurons.

Drosophila deficient for the transcription factor Klf15 (Klf15NN) are viable but lack nephrocytes-cells structurally and functionally homologous to the glomerular podocytes of the kidney. We found that Klf15NN flies were more resistant to infection than wild-type (WT) counterparts but exhibited a shortened lifespan. This was associated with constitutive Toll pathway activation triggered by excess peptidoglycan circulating in Klf15NN flies. In WT flies, peptidoglycan was removed from systemic circulation by nephrocytes through endocytosis and subsequent lysosomal degradation. Thus, renal filtration of microbiota-derived peptidoglycan maintains immune homeostasis in Drosophila, a function likely conserved in mammals and potentially relevant to the chronic immune activation seen in settings of impaired blood filtration.",2019,"Andrew Pivovar, Peter Nagy, Katia Troha, Brian P Lazzaro, Nicolas Buchon, Paul S Hartley"

"Activated Ras/JNK driven Dilp8 in imaginal discs adversely affects organismal homeostasis during early pupal stage in Drosophila, a new checkpoint for development",31415125,10.1002/dvdy.102,"Background: Dilp8-mediated inhibition of ecdysone synthesis and pupation in holometabolous insects maintains developmental homeostasis through stringent control of timing and strength of molting signals. We examined reasons for normal pupation but early pupal death observed in certain cases. Results: Overexpression of activated Ras in developing eye/wing discs inhibited Ptth expression in brain via upregulated JNK signaling mediated Dilp8 secretion from imaginal discs, which inhibited ecdysone synthesis in prothoracic gland after pupariation, leading to death of ~25- to 30-hour-old pupae. Inhibition of elevated Ras signaling completely rescued early pupal death while post-pupation administration of ecdysone to organisms with elevated Ras signaling in eye discs partially rescued their early pupal death. Unlike the earlier known Dilp8 action in delaying pupation, hyperactivated Ras mediated elevation of pJNK signaling in imaginal discs caused Dilp8 secretion after pupariation. Ectopic expression of certain other transgene causing pupal lethality similarly enhanced pJNK and early pupal Dilp8 levels. Suboptimal ecdysone levels after 8 hours of pupation prevented the early pupal metamorphic changes and caused organismal death.

NBS1 interacts with HP1 to ensure genome integrity,31836699,10.1038/s41419-019-2185-x,"Heterochromatin Protein 1 (HP1) and the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (MRN) complex are conserved factors that play crucial role in genome stability and integrity. Despite their involvement in overlapping cellular functions, ranging from chromatin organization, telomere maintenance to DNA replication and repair, a tight functional relationship between HP1 and the MRN complex has never been elucidated. Here we show that the Drosophila HP1a protein binds to the MRN complex through its chromoshadow domain (CSD). In addition, loss of any of the MRN members reduces HP1a levels indicating that the MRN complex acts as regulator of HP1a stability. Moreover, overexpression of HP1a in nbs (but not in rad50 or mre11) mutant cells drastically reduces DNA damage associated with the loss of Nbs suggesting that HP1a and Nbs work in concert to maintain chromosome integrity in flies. We have also found that human HP1α and NBS1 interact with each other and that, similarly to Drosophila, siRNA-mediated inhibition of NBS1 reduces HP1α levels in human cultured cells. Surprisingly, fibroblasts from Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome (NBS) patients, carrying the 657del5 hypomorphic mutation in NBS1 and expressing the p26 and p70 NBS1 fragments, accumulate HP1α indicating that, differently from NBS1 knockout cells, the presence of truncated NBS1 extends HP1α turnover and/or promotes its stability. Remarkably, an siRNA-mediated reduction of HP1α in NBS fibroblasts decreases the hypersensitivity to irradiation, a characteristic of the NBS syndrome.

Here, we investigate the mechanism by which the Drosophila Ajuba family protein Jub is recruited to adherens junctions, and the contribution of this recruitment to the regulation of Yorkie. We identify α-catenin as the mechanotransducer responsible for tension-dependent recruitment of Jub by identifying a region of α-catenin that associates with Jub, and by identifying a region, which when deleted, allows constitutive, tension-independent recruitment of Jub. We also show that increased Jub recruitment to α-catenin is associated with increased Yorkie activity and wing growth, even in the absence of increased cytoskeletal tension. Our observations establish α-catenin as a multi-functional mechanotransducer and confirm Jub recruitment to α-catenin as a key contributor to biomechanical regulation of Hippo signaling.",2019,"Cordelia Rauskolb, Elmira Kirichenko, Yu-Chiun Wang, Christopher Markosian, Janice Yang, Kenneth D Irvine, Herve Alégot"
Distinct RNA-binding modules in a single PUF protein cooperate to determine RNA specificity,31294800,10.1093/nar/gkz583,"PUF proteins, named for Drosophila Pumilio (PUM) and Caenorhabditis elegans fem-3-binding factor (FBF), recognize specific sequences in the mRNAs they bind and control. RNA binding by classical PUF proteins is mediated by a characteristic PUM homology domain (PUM-HD). The Puf1 and Puf2 proteins possess a distinct architecture and comprise a highly conserved subfamily among fungal species. Puf1/Puf2 proteins contain two types of RNA-binding domain: a divergent PUM-HD and an RNA recognition motif (RRM). They recognize RNAs containing UAAU motifs, often in clusters. Here, we report a crystal structure of the PUM-HD of a fungal Puf1 in complex with a dual UAAU motif RNA. Each of the two UAAU tetranucleotides are bound by a Puf1 PUM-HD forming a 2:1 protein-to-RNA complex. We also determined crystal structures of the Puf1 RRM domain that identified a dimerization interface. The PUM-HD and RRM domains act in concert to determine RNA-binding specificity: the PUM-HD dictates binding to UAAU, and dimerization of the RRM domain favors binding to dual UAAU motifs rather than a single UAAU.

In the Drosophila wing epithelium, Wingless (Wg, the homolog of Wnt1) is secreted from a narrow strip of cells at the dorsal-ventral boundary. However, the route of Wg secretion in polarized epithelial cells remains poorly understood and key proteins involved in this process are still unknown. Here, we performed an in vivo RNAi screen and identified members of the exocyst complex to be required for apical but not basolateral Wg secretion. Specifically blocking the apical Wg secretion leads to reduced downstream signaling. Using an in vivo 'temporal-rescue' assay, our results further indicate that apically secreted Wg activates target genes that require high signaling activity. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that the exocyst is required for an apical route of Wg secretion from polarized wing epithelial cells.",2019,"Michael Boutros, Varun Chaudhary"
Transgenerational inheritance of cold temperature response in Drosophila,30779346,10.1002/1873-3468.13343,"Intergenerational inheritance of transcriptional responses induced by low temperature rearing has recently been shown in Drosophila. Besides germline inheritance, fecal transfer experiments indirectly suggested that the acquired microbiome may also have contributed to the transcriptional responses in offspring. Here, we analyze expression data on inheritance of the cold-induced effects in conjunction with previously reported transcriptomic differences between flies with a microbiota or axenic flies and provide support for a contribution of the acquired microbiome to the offspring phenotype. Also, based on a similar analysis in conjunction with diet- and metabolism-related fly transcriptome data, we predicted and, then, experimentally confirmed that cold regulates triglyceride levels both inter- as well as trans-generationally.",2019,"Pinreddy Karunakar, Ameek Bhalla, Abhay Sharma"
Sex-Specific Among-Individual Covariation in Locomotor Activity and Resting Metabolic Rate in Drosophila melanogaster,31738101,10.1086/705678,"A key endeavor in evolutionary physiology is to identify sources of among- and within-individual variation in resting metabolic rate (RMR). Although males and females often differ in whole-organism RMR due to sexual size dimorphism, sex differences in RMR sometimes persist after conditioning on body mass, suggesting phenotypic differences between males and females in energy-expensive activities contributing to RMR. One potential difference is locomotor activity, yet its relationship with RMR is unclear and different energy budget models predict different associations. We quantified locomotor activity (walking) over 24 h and RMR (overnight) in 232 male and 245 female Drosophila melanogaster that were either mated or maintained as virgins between two sets of measurements. Accounting for body mass, sex, and reproductive status, RMR and activity were significantly and moderately repeatable (RMR: R=0.33±0.06; activity: R=0.58±0.03). RMR and activity were positively correlated among (rind=0.26±0.09) but not within (re=0.05±0.06) individuals. Moreover, activity varied throughout the day and between the sexes. Partitioning our analysis by sex and activity by time of day revealed that all among-individual correlations were positive and significant in males but nonsignificant or even significantly negative in females. Such differences in the RMR-activity covariance suggest fundamental differences in how the sexes manage their energy budget.",2019,"Vincent Careau, Howard D Rundle, Mathieu Videlier"

Automated real-time quantification of group locomotor activity in Drosophila melanogaster,30872709,10.1038/s41598-019-40952-5,"Recent advances in neurogenetics have highlighted Drosophila melanogaster as an exciting model to study neural circuit dynamics and complex behavior. Automated tracking methods have facilitated the study of complex behaviors via high throughput behavioral screening. Here we describe a newly developed low-cost assay capable of real-time monitoring and quantifying Drosophila group activity. This platform offers reliable real-time quantification with open source software and a user-friendly interface for data acquisition and analysis. We demonstrate the utility of this platform by characterizing ethanol-induced locomotor activity in a dose-dependent manner as well as the effects of thermo and optogenetic manipulation of ellipsoid body neurons important for ethanol-induced locomotor activity. As expected, low doses of ethanol induced an initial startle and slow ramping of group activity, whereas high doses of ethanol induced sustained group activity followed by sedation. Advanced offline processing revealed discrete behavioral features characteristic of intoxication. Thermogenetic inactivation of ellipsoid body ring neurons reduced group activity whereas optogenetic activation increased activity. Together, these data establish the fly Group Activity Monitor (flyGrAM) platform as a robust means of obtaining an online read out of group activity in response to manipulations to the environment or neural activity, with an opportunity for more advanced post-processing offline.",2019,"Karla R Kaun, Reza Azanchi, Sophia L Song, Kristin M Scaplen, Hayley A Bounds, Nicholas J Mei"
Bayesian model selection for the Drosophila gap gene network,31195954,10.1186/s12859-019-2888-0,"Background: The gap gene system controls the early cascade of the segmentation pathway in Drosophila melanogaster as well as other insects. Owing to its tractability and key role in embryo patterning, this system has been the focus for both computational modelers and experimentalists. The gap gene expression dynamics can be considered strictly as a one-dimensional process and modeled as a system of reaction-diffusion equations. While substantial progress has been made in modeling this phenomenon, there still remains a deficit of approaches to evaluate competing hypotheses. Most of the model development has happened in isolation and there has been little attempt to compare candidate models. Results: The Bayesian framework offers a means of doing formal model evaluation. Here, we demonstrate how this framework can be used to compare different models of gene expression. We focus on the Papatsenko-Levine formalism, which exploits a fractional occupancy based approach to incorporate activation of the gap genes by the maternal genes and cross-regulation by the gap genes themselves. The Bayesian approach provides insight about relationship between system parameters. In the regulatory pathway of segmentation, the parameters for number of binding sites and binding affinity have a negative correlation. The model selection analysis supports a stronger binding affinity for Bicoid compared to other regulatory edges, as shown by a larger posterior mean. The procedure doesn't show support for activation of Kruppel by Bicoid. Conclusions: We provide an efficient solver for the general representation of the Papatsenko-Levine model. We also demonstrate the utility of Bayes factor for evaluating candidate models for spatial pattering models. In addition, by using the parallel tempering sampler, the convergence of Markov chains can be remarkably improved and robust estimates of Bayes factors obtained.",2019,"Asif Zubair, Sergey V Nuzhdin, Paul Marjoram, I Gary Rosen"
Evolutionary rate covariation analysis of E-cadherin identifies Raskol as a regulator of cell adhesion and actin dynamics in Drosophila,30763317,10.1371/journal.pgen.1007720,"The adherens junction couples the actin cytoskeletons of neighboring cells to provide the foundation for multicellular organization. The core of the adherens junction is the cadherin-catenin complex that arose early in the evolution of multicellularity to link actin to intercellular adhesions. Over time, evolutionary pressures have shaped the signaling and mechanical functions of the adherens junction to meet specific developmental and physiological demands. Evolutionary rate covariation (ERC) identifies proteins with correlated fluctuations in evolutionary rate that can reflect shared selective pressures and functions. Here we use ERC to identify proteins with evolutionary histories similar to the Drosophila E-cadherin (DE-cad) ortholog. Core adherens junction components α-catenin and p120-catenin displayed positive ERC correlations with DE-cad, indicating that they evolved under similar selective pressures during evolution between Drosophila species. Further analysis of the DE-cad ERC profile revealed a collection of proteins not previously associated with DE-cad function or cadherin-mediated adhesion. We then analyzed the function of a subset of ERC-identified candidates by RNAi during border cell (BC) migration and identified novel genes that function to regulate DE-cad. Among these, we found that the gene CG42684, which encodes a putative GTPase activating protein (GAP), regulates BC migration and adhesion. We named CG42684 raskol (""to split"" in Russian) and show that it regulates DE-cad levels and actin protrusions in BCs. We propose that Raskol functions with DE-cad to restrict Ras/Rho signaling and help guide BC migration. Our results demonstrate that a coordinated selective pressure has shaped the adherens junction and this can be leveraged to identify novel components of the complexes and signaling pathways that regulate cadherin-mediated adhesion.",2019,"Nathan L Clark, Maria Chikina, Jae Young Choi, Qanber Raza, Adam V Kwiatkowski, Roisin M O'Dowd, Simon C Watkins, Yang Li, Yang Hong"
Molecular evidence supports a genic capture resolution of the lek paradox,30911052,10.1038/s41467-019-09371-y,"The genic capture hypothesis, where sexually selected traits capture genetic variation in condition and the condition reflects genome-wide mutation load, stands to explain the presence of abundant genetic variation underlying sexually selected traits. Here we test this hypothesis by applying bidirectional selection to male mating success for 14 generations in replicate populations of Drosophila melanogaster. We then resequenced the genomes of flies from each population. Consistent with the central predictions of the genic capture hypothesis, we show that genetic variance decreased with success selection and increased with failure selection, providing evidence for purifying sexual selection. This pattern was distributed across the genome and no consistent molecular pathways were associated with divergence, consistent with condition being the target of selection. Together, our results provide molecular evidence suggesting that strong sexual selection erodes genetic variation, and that genome-wide mutation-selection balance contributes to its maintenance.",2019,"W Jason Kennington, Joseph L Tomkins, Robert J Dugand"
A Novel Neuroprotective Role of Phosphatase of Regenerating Liver-1 against CO 2 Stimulation in Drosophila,31404830,10.1016/j.isci.2019.07.026,"Neuroprotection is essential for the maintenance of normal physiological functions in the nervous system. This is especially true under stress conditions. Here, we demonstrate a novel protective function of PRL-1 against CO2 stimulation in Drosophila. In the absence of PRL-1, flies exhibit a permanent held-up wing phenotype upon CO2 exposure. Knockdown of the CO2 olfactory receptor, Gr21a, suppresses the phenotype. Our genetic data indicate that the wing phenotype is due to a neural dysfunction. PRL-1 physically interacts with Uex and controls Uex expression levels. Knockdown of Uex alone leads to a similar wing held-up phenotype to that of PRL-1 mutants. Uex acts downstream of PRL-1. Elevated Uex levels in PRL-1 mutants prevent the CO2-induced phenotype. PRL-1 and Uex are required for a wide range of neurons to maintain neuroprotective functions. Expression of human homologs of PRL-1 could rescue the phenotype in Drosophila, suggesting a similar function in humans.",2019,"Xiao Xu, Yinqi Tu, Xin Yuan, Zhefeng Gong, Yongmei Xi, Xiaohang Yang, Pengfei Guo, Wanzhong Ge, Fang Wang, Huimei Zheng, Bei Zhang, Danqing Yu"
Functional interaction between the mouse notch1 intracellular region and histone acetyltransferases PCAF and GCN5,10747963,10.1074/jbc.M000909200,"The Notch receptor that plays an important role in cell fate determination is intracellularly cleaved by interaction with the ligand. The cleaved intracellular region (RAMIC) of Notch is translocated into the nucleus and interacts with a DNA-binding protein RBP-J to activate transcription of genes that regulate cell differentiation. Although RAMIC has been shown to facilitate the RBP-J-mediated transactivation by displacing the histone deacetylase corepressor complex from RBP-J, there is no evidence demonstrating the involvement of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) in the transactivation. Here we show that mouse Notch1 RAMIC interacts with two conserved HATs, mouse PCAF and GCN5, and recruits each of the HATs to RBP-J. The ankyrin repeats and the transactivation domain of RAMIC and the N-terminal regions of PCAF and GCN5, respectively, are required for the interaction. We also show that not only mouse Notch1 but also Drosophila Notch RAMIC interacts with mouse PCAF and GCN5 in mammalian cells. Furthermore, the RBP-J-mediated transactivation activity of RAMIC is repressed by two HAT inhibitor proteins, E1A and Twist. These results suggest that HATs including PCAF and GCN5 play an important role in the RBP-J-mediated transactivation by RAMIC.",2000,"T Honjo, H Kurooka"
Cryptochrome: the second photoactive pigment in the eye and its role in circadian photoreception,10966452,10.1146/annurev.biochem.69.1.31,"Circadian rhythms are oscillations in the biochemical, physiological, and behavioral functions of organisms that occur with a periodicity of approximately 24 h. They are generated by a molecular clock that is synchronized with the solar day by environmental photic input. The cryptochromes are the mammalian circadian photoreceptors. They absorb light and transmit the electromagnetic signal to the molecular clock using a pterin and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) as chromophore/cofactors, and are evolutionarily conserved and structurally related to the DNA repair enzyme photolyase. Humans and mice have two cryptochrome genes, CRY1 and CRY2, that are differentially expressed in the retina relative to the opsin-based visual photoreceptors. CRY1 is highly expressed with circadian periodicity in the mammalian circadian pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Mutant mice lacking either Cry1 or Cry2 have impaired light induction of the clock gene mPer1 and have abnormally short or long intrinsic periods, respectively. The double mutant has normal vision but is defective in mPer1 induction by light and lacks molecular and behavioral rhythmicity in constant darkness. Thus, cryptochromes are photoreceptors and central components of the molecular clock. Genetic evidence also shows that cryptochromes are circadian photoreceptors in Drosophila and Arabidopsis, raising the possibility that they may be universal circadian photoreceptors. Research on cryptochromes may provide new understanding of human diseases such as seasonal affective disorder and delayed sleep phase syndrome.",2000,A Sancar

Using a mosaic follicle cell system we have identified a mutation in the D-cbl gene which causes hyperactivation of the Egfr pathway. Cbl proteins are known to downregulate activated receptors. We find that the abnormal Egfr activation is ligand dependent. Our results show that the precise regulation of Egfr activity necessary to establish different follicle cell fates requires two levels of control. The localized ligand Gurken activates Egfr to different levels in different follicle cells. In addition, Egfr activity has to be repressed through the activity of D-cbl to ensure the absence of signaling in the ventral most follicle cells.",2000,"T Schüpbach, G Barcelo, L M Pai"

We present a developmental profile of peripheral glia in Drosophila melanogaster that includes glial genesis, developmental morphology, the establishment of transient cellular contacts, migration patterns, and the extent of nerve wrapping in the embryonic and larval stages. In early embryonic development, immature peripheral glia that are born in the CNS seem to be intermediate targets for neurites that are migrating into the periphery. During migration to the PNS, peripheral glia follow the routes of pioneer neurons. The glia preferentially adhere to sensory axonal projections, extending cytoplasmic processes along them such that by the end of embryogenesis peripheral glial coverage of the sensory system is complete. In contrast, significant lengths of motor branch termini are unsheathed in the mature embryo. During larval stages however, peripheral glia further extend and elaborate their cytoplasmic processes until they often reach to the neuromuscular junction. Throughout the embryonic and larval developmental stages, we have also observed a number of similarities of peripheral glia to vertebrate Schwann cells and astrocytes. Peripheral glia seem to have dynamic and diverse roles and their similarities to vertebrate glia suggest that Drosophila may serve as a powerful tool for analysis of glial roles in PNS development in the future.",2000,"J Schulte, V J Auld, K J Sepp"
Drosophila AD3 mutation of synaptotagmin impairs calcium-dependent self-oligomerization activity,11024474,10.1016/s0014-5793(00)02064-0,"Genetic analysis of a Drosophila synaptotagmin (Syt) I mutant (AD3) has revealed that Tyr-334 within the C2B domain is essential for efficient Ca(2+)-dependent neurotransmitter release. However, little is known as to why a missense mutation (Tyr-334-Asn) disrupts the function of the C2B domain at the molecular level. Here, we present evidence that a Tyr-312 to Asn substitution in mouse Syt II, which corresponds to the Drosophila AD3 mutation, completely impairs Ca(2+)-dependent self-oligomerization activity mediated by the C2B domain but allows partial interaction with wild-type proteins in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. This observation is consistent with the fact that the AD3 allele is homozygous lethal but complements another mutant phenotype. We also showed that the Ca(2+)-dependent C2B self-oligomerization is inhibited by inositol 1,3,4, 5-tetrakisphosphate, a potent inhibitor of neurotransmitter release. All of these findings strongly support the idea that self-oligomerization of Syt I or II is essential for neurotransmitter release in vivo.",2000,"K Mikoshiba, H Kabayama, M Fukuda"
gamma-catenin is regulated by the APC tumor suppressor and its oncogenic activity is distinct from that of beta-catenin,10837025,,"beta-Catenin and gamma-catenin (plakoglobin), vertebrate homologs of Drosophila armadillo, function in cell adhesion and the Wnt signaling pathway. In colon and other cancers, mutations in the APC tumor suppressor protein or beta-catenin's amino terminus stabilize beta-catenin, enhancing its ability to activate transcription of Tcf/Lef target genes. Though beta- and gamma-catenin have analogous structures and functions and like binding to APC, evidence that gamma-catenin has an important role in cancer has been lacking. We report here that APC regulates both beta- and gamma-catenin and gamma-catenin functions as an oncogene. In contrast to beta-catenin, for which only amino-terminal mutated forms transform RK3E epithelial cells, wild-type and several amino-terminal mutated forms of gamma-catenin had similar transforming activity. gamma-Catenin's transforming activity, like beta-catenin's, was dependent on Tcf/Lef function. However, in contrast to beta-catenin, gamma-catenin strongly activated c-Myc expression and c-Myc function was crucial for gamma-catenin transformation. Our findings suggest APC mutations alter regulation of both beta- and gamma-catenin, perhaps explaining why the frequency of APC mutations in colon cancer far exceeds that of beta-catenin mutations. Elevated c-Myc expression in cancers with APC defects may be due to altered regulation of both beta- and gamma-catenin. Furthermore, the data imply beta- and gamma-catenin may have distinct roles in Wnt signaling and cancer via differential effects on downstream target genes.",2000,"M Tani, F T Kolligs, G Hu, B Kolligs, K R Cho, E R Fearon, K M Hajra"

However, little is known of the role of these carcasses in other containers, which also receive leaf fall and stemflow inputs. This experiment investigated effects of accumulated invertebrate carcasses as a resource for two competing mosquitoes, Aedes albopictus (Skuse) and Aedes aegypti (L.), whether either species differentially benefited from accumulated carcasses, and if such a benefit affected interspecific competition. First, we measured accumulation of invertebrate carcasses in standard containers at a field site. We then used a replacement series with five different species ratios at the same total density, and varied the input of invertebrate carcasses [dead Drosophila melanogaster (Meigen) ] in three levels: none, the average input from our field site, or the maximum input recorded at our field site. Survivorship, development time, and mass were measured for each mosquito species as correlates of population growth, and were used to calculate a population performance index, lambda'. There were strong positive effects of invertebrate carcass additions on all growth correlates and lambda'. Differences in performance between species were pronounced in small or no carcass additions and absent in large inputs of invertebrate carcasses, but there was little evidence that inputs of invertebrate carcasses altered the competitive advantage in this system. These results suggest that terrestrial invertebrate carcasses may be an important resource for many types of container communities, and large accumulations of dead invertebrates may reduce resource competition between these mosquitoes, thus favoring coexistence. We propose that the total amount of resource, including accumulated invertebrate carcasses, may explain observed patterns of replacement involving these mosquitoes.",2000,"M P Daugherty, S A Juliano, B W Alto"

Molecular aspects of intron evolution in dynein encoding mega-genes on the heterochromatic Y chromosome of Drosophila sp,11293786,10.1023/a:1026552604229,"Fertility genes on the heterochromatic Y chromosome of various Drosophila species are unique for several reasons. Most of them are megabase-sized. Their expression is restricted to premeiotic spermatocytes and often associated with unfolding of huge species-specific lampbrush loops. Molecular analysis of the orthologous dynein genes Dhc-Yh3, DhDhc7(Y) and DeDhc7(Y) on the Y chromosome of the three species D. melanogaster, D. hydei and D. eohydei, respectively, revealed that the megabase gene size as well as the species-specific morphology of the corresponding lampbrush loops kl-5, Threads and diffuse loops result from huge introns and their specific sequence composition, whereas the majority of all 20 introns in each of the three genes is in a size of 45-72 bp. The loop-specifying introns are extreme exceptions due to extended assemblies of degenerated transposable elements and/or large clusters of satellite DNAs. Here we use sequence information from the complete intron sets of three orthologous Y chromosomal dynein genes to deduce a scenario for an evolutionary pathway leading to the megabase-sized genes on the heterochromatic Y chromosome of Drosophila. The obvious bias between very small and species-specific mega introns is explained as the result of an autocatalytic mode of intron growth. An initial coincidental hit by a single transposable element extends the size of a 50 bp intron for about two orders of magnitude and determines it for preferential extension by similar insertion events. This phase of continuous moderate growth is followed by rapid size enlargements by repeating amplifications generating extended clusters of satellite DNA. Size control by recombination, on the other hand, is suppressed in Drosophila males by achiasmatic meiosis.",2000,"U Lammermann, A M Reugels, R Kurek, H Bünemann"
The Drosophila wispy gene is required for RNA localization and other microtubule-based events of meiosis and early embryogenesis,10747060,,"RNAs are localized by microtubule-based pathways to both the anterior and posterior poles of the developing Drosophila oocyte. We describe a new gene, wispy, required for localization of mRNAs to both poles of the egg. Embryos from wispy mothers arrest development after abnormal oocyte meiosis and failure of pronuclei to fuse. Our analysis of spindle and chromosome movements during meiosis reveals defects in spindle structures correlated with very high frequencies of chromosome nondisjunction and loss. Spindle defects include abnormally shaped spindles, spindle spurs, and ectopic spindles associated with lost chromosomes, as well as mispositioning of the meiosis II spindles. The polar body nuclei do not associate with their normal monastral arrays of microtubules, the sperm aster is reduced in size, and the centrosomes often dissociate from a mitotic spindle that forms in association with the male pronucleus. We show that wispy is required to recruit or maintain known centrosomal proteins with two types of microtubule organizing centers (MTOCs): (1) the central MTOC that forms between the meiosis II tandem spindles and (2) the centrosomes of the mitotic spindle.

As the biochemical properties of GCMb have not been studied so far, we have undertaken a detailed structure-function analysis of the mouse GCMb (mGCMb) protein. DNA-binding specificity was very similar to that of other GCM proteins. Nevertheless, mGCMb was only a weak transcriptional activator in a number of different tissue culture systems. Interestingly, this was not due to an intrinsic absence of transactivation potential. In effect, we were able to identify two separate transactivation domains within mGCMb, one carboxyl-terminally adjacent to the DNA-binding domain and the second within the extreme carboxyl terminus. Activity of both transactivation domains was, however, modulated by an inhibitory region unique to mGCMb and located between the two transactivation domains. Furthermore, pulse-chase experiments proved that the mGCMb protein has a half-life approximately four times shorter than mGCMa. Introduction of the above mentioned inhibitory domain of mGCMb into mGCMa shortened the half-life of mGCMa to a value typical of mGCMb with a concomitant reduction in transactivation potential. Given the strong correlation between protein stability and transactivation potential, functional differences between the two mammalian GCM homologs are likely due to differences in stability with a single inhibitory region in mGCMb being involved in the reduction of both.",2000,"J Schreiber, M Wegner, E E Tuerk"

"Regulation of invasive cell behavior by taiman, a Drosophila protein related to AIB1, a steroid receptor coactivator amplified in breast cancer",11163181,10.1016/s0092-8674(00)00208-7,"Steroid hormones are key regulators of numerous physiological and developmental processes, including metastasis of breast and ovarian cancer. Here we report the identification of a Drosophila gene, named taiman, which encodes a steroid hormone receptor coactivator related to AIB1. Mutations in tai caused defects in the migration of specific follicle cells, the border cells, in the Drosophila ovary. Mutant cells exhibited abnormal accumulation of E-cadherin, beta-catenin, and focal adhesion kinase. TAI protein colocalized with the ecdysone receptor in vivo and augmented transcriptional activation by the ecdysone receptor in cultured cells. The finding of this type of coactivator required for cell motility suggests a novel role for steroid hormones, in stimulating invasive cell behavior, independent of effects on proliferation.",2000,"D J Montell, Y Uehara, J Bai"
Coexpression of the homeobox genes Distal-less and homothorax determines Drosophila antennal identity,10603339,,"The Distal-less gene is known for its role in proximodistal patterning of Drosophila limbs. However, Distal-less has a second critical function during Drosophila limb development, that of distinguishing the antenna from the leg. The antenna-specifying activity of Distal-less is genetically separable from the proximodistal patterning function in that certain Distal-less allelic combinations exhibit antenna-to-leg transformations without proximodistal truncations. Here, we show that Distal-less acts in parallel with homothorax, a previously identified antennal selector gene, to induce antennal differentiation. While mutations in either Distal-less or homothorax cause antenna-to-leg transformations, neither gene is required for the others expression, and both genes are required for antennal expression of spalt. Coexpression of Distal-less and homothorax activates ectopic spalt expression and can induce the formation of ectopic antennae at novel locations in the body, including the head, the legs, the wings and the genital disc derivatives. Ectopic expression of homothorax alone is insufficient to induce antennal differentiation from most limb fields, including that of the wing. Distal-less therefore is required for more than induction of a proximodistal axis upon which homothorax superimposes antennal identity. Based on their genetic and biochemical properties, we propose that Homothorax and Extradenticle may serve as antenna-specific cofactors for Distal-less.",2000,"G Panganiban, P D Dong, J Chu"
Neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors from Drosophila: two different types of alpha subunits coassemble within the same receptor complex,10820216,10.1046/j.1471-4159.2000.0742537.x,"Although neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors from insects have been reconstituted in vitro more than a decade ago, our knowledge about the subunit composition of native receptors as well as their functional properties still remains limited. Immunohistochemical evidence has suggested that two alpha subunits, alpha-like subunit (ALS) and Drosophila alpha2 subunit (Dalpha2), are colocalized in the synaptic neuropil of the Drosophila CNS and therefore may be subunits of the same receptor complex. To gain further understanding of the composition of these nicotinic receptors, we have examined the possibility that a receptor may imbed more than one alpha subunit using immunoprecipitations and electrophysiological investigations. Immunoprecipitation experiments of fly head extracts revealed that ALS-specific antibodies coprecipitate Dalpha2, and vice versa, and thereby suggest that these two alpha subunits must be contained within the same receptor complex, a result that is supported by investigations of reconstituted receptors in Xenopus oocytes. Discrimination between binary (ALS/beta2 or Dalpha2/beta2) and ternary (ALS/Dalpha2/beta2) receptor complexes was made on the basis of their dose-response curve to acetylcholine as well as their sensitivity to alpha-bungarotoxin or dihydro-beta-erythroidine. These data demonstrate that the presence of the two alpha subunits within a single receptor complex confers new receptor properties that cannot be predicted from knowledge of the binary receptor's properties.",2000,"K H Smalla, E D Gundelfinger, K Chamaon, S Bertrand, D Bertrand, R Schulz"
Stress-reactivity and juvenile hormone degradation in Drosophila melanogaster strains having stress-related mutations,10876121,10.1016/s0965-1748(00)00049-7,"Juvenile hormone (JH) degradation was studied under normal and stress conditions in young and matured females of Drosophila melanogaster strains having mutations in different genes involved in responses to stress It was shown that (1) the impairment in heat shock response elicits an alteration in stress-reactivity of the JH system; (2) the impairment JH reception causes a decrease of JH-hydrolysing activity and of stress-reactivity in young females, while in mature ones stress reactivity is completely absent; (3) the absence of octopamine results in higher JH-hydrolysis level under normal conditions and altered JH stress-reactivity; (4) the higher dopamine content elicits a dramatic decrease of JH degradation under normal conditions and of JH stress-reactivity.

Kinesin-dependent axonal transport is mediated by the sunday driver (SYD) protein,11106729,10.1016/s0092-8674(00)00162-8,"A broadly conserved membrane-associated protein required for the functional interaction of kinesin-I with axonal cargo was identified.

Coimmunoprecipitation analysis indicates that mouse SYD forms a complex with kinesin-I in vivo. Yeast two-hybrid analysis and in vitro interaction studies reveal that SYD directly binds kinesin-I via the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain of kinesin light chain (KLC) with K(d) congruent with 200 nM.

Evolution of abdominal pigmentation differences across species in the Drosophila dunni subgroup,11209781,10.1111/j.0014-3820.2000.tb01248.x,"The Drosophila dunni subgroup displays a nearly perfect latitudinal cline in abdominal pigmentation that likely resulted from selective forces acting in the habitat of each species during speciation. Here we characterize the nature of this clinal variation by developing a quantitative measure to assess variation in abdominal pigmentation within and between the D. dunni subgroup species. Using discriminant analysis, we confirm the existence of a cline and find that our quantitative measure of pigmentation distinguishes each of the species with singular efficacy. We then combine our quantitative phenotypic analysis of pigmentation with the phylogeny of the D. dunni subgroup species and map the species relationships into the three-dimensional morphological space defined by our pigmentation measures. In this manner, we can visualize how the species have traversed the morphological pigmentation space during the course of speciation. Our analysis reveals that natural selection has caused overall intensity of pigmentation among the northernmost species of the cline to converge. Along with this convergence in phenotype has been a relaxation in expression of sexual dimorphism in these species, indicating a possible shift in the relative intensity of natural and sexual selection. Our analysis indicates an accelerated rate of change in pigmentation for the darkest species in addition to this species evolving a novel abdominal pigmentation trait.",2000,"H Hollocher, E G Dyreson, J L Hatcher"
Loss of drug-stimulated topoisomerase II DNA breaks in living cells is different at two unrelated loci,10954596,10.1093/nar/28.17.3289,"Topoisomerase II (top2) has been implicated in the initial steps of chromosomal translocations leading to leukemias and lymphomas, since it can generate DNA cleavage. To evaluate the effects of chromatin structure on enzyme-mediated cleavage, we determined the kinetics of loss of double-stranded DNA breaks stimulated by top2 poisons in Drosophila melanogaster Kc cells at two genomic regions that differ in chromatin structure. Moreover, cleavage loss was determined at 25 degrees C as well as after heat shock. Kinetics were dependent on the poison, nevertheless, loss rate overall was slow at the histone gene cluster, an active chromatin domain. At the repressed satellite III DNA, loss of cleavage was much faster and complete after 5 min in drug-free medium. In addition, differences were noted among sites that were closely spaced and equally intense. Following heat shock at 37 degrees C, we observed reduced cleavage levels and faster loss of breaks at the histone gene cluster. In vitro reversal could only partially explain the in vivo kinetics. Thus, the chromatin context of DNA breaks might play a role in the loss of top2 DNA breaks. The present findings suggest that irreversible cuts may more likely occur in active than silent loci.",2000,"G Capranico, M E Borgnetto, M Binaschi"
Ubiquitous overexpression of a transgene encoding the extracellular portion of the Drosophila roughest-irregular chiasm C protein induces early embryonic lethality,11028102,10.1590/s0001-37652000000300011,"The cell adhesion molecule Rst-irreC is a transmembrane glycoprotein of the immunoglobulin superfamily involved in several important developmental processes in Drosophila, including axonal pathfinding in the optic lobe and programmed cell death and pigment cell differentiation in the pupal retina. As an initial step towards the ""in vivo"" functional analysis of this protein we have generated transgenic fly stocks carrying a truncated cDNA construct encoding only the extracellular domain of Rst-IrreC under the transcriptional control of the heat shock inducible promoter hsp70. We show that heat-shocking embryos bearing the transgene during the first 8hs of development lead to a 3-4 fold reduction in their viability compared to wild type controls. The embryonic lethality can already be produced by applying the heat pulse in the first 3hs of embryonic development, does not seem to be suppressed in the absence of wildtype product and is progressively reduced as the heat treatment is applied later in embryogenesis. These results are compatible with the hypothesis of the lethal phenotype being primarily due to heterophilic interactions between Rst-IrreC extracellular domain and an yet unknown ligand.",2000,"R C Machado, L Moda, R G Ramos"
Thirty-plus functional families from a single motif,11206068,10.1110/ps.9.12.2470,"It is now possible to identify over 30 functional subfamilies among the WD-repeat-containing proteins found in the completed genomes.

Half of the 63 WD-repeat-containing proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, half of the 70 in Caenorhabditis elegans, and a third of the 100 plus predicted in Drosophila can be assigned to 23 of these functional subfamilies. Perhaps indicative of the future, 33 WD-repeat-containing proteins from the partial genome of Arabidopsis thaliana can now be assigned to 18 of these subfamilies.

MPM-2 antibodies recognize the phosphorylated protein. In vitro, DMAP-85 can be phosphorylated by the mitotic kinase Polo affecting its binding to MTs and creating MPM-2 epitopes on the protein.

Function of RRM domains of Drosophila melanogaster ELAV: Rnp1 mutations and rrm domain replacements with ELAV family proteins and SXL,10924474,,"Members of the ELAV family of proteins contain three RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), which are highly conserved. ELAV, a Drosophila melanogaster member of this family, provides a vital function and exhibits a predominantly nuclear localization. To investigate if the RNA-binding property of each of the ELAV RRMs is required for ELAV's in vivo function, amino acid residues critical in RNA binding for each RRM were individually mutated. A stringent genetic complementation test revealed that when the mutant protein was the sole source of ELAV, RNA-binding ability of each RRM was essential to ELAV function. To assess the degree to which each domain was specific for ELAV function and which domains perhaps performed a function common to related ELAV proteins, we substituted an ELAV RRM with the corresponding RRM from RBP9, the D. melanogaster protein most homologous to ELAV; HuD, a human ELAV family protein; and SXL, which, although evolutionarily related, is not an ELAV family member. This analysis revealed that RRM3 replacements were fully functional, but RRM1 and RRM2 replacements were largely nonfunctional. Under less stringent conditions RRM1 and RRM2 replacements from SXL and RRM1 replacement from RBP9 were able to provide supplemental function in the presence of a mutant hypomorphic ELAV protein.",2000,"K White, M Gordon, Y M Yannoni, M J Lisbin"

"Murine Delta homologue, mDelta1, expressed on feeder cells controls cellular differentiation",10791891,10.1247/csf.25.21,"The Delta/Serrate-Notch pathway is involved in intercellular signaling that controls cell fate during the development of invertebrates and vertebrates. Delta is a prototype of Notch ligands and has been studied extensively in Drosophila. In higher vertebrates, four Delta/Serrate homologues and four Notch homologues have been identified. Recent studies showed that the murine Delta homologue, mDelta1, is essential in early embryogenesis. The biological activity of mammalian Delta and its roles in cellular differentiation, however, have remained unclear. In this study, we first surveyed expression of mDelta1 in the adult mouse and found it to be present in a wide range of tissues. For testing biological activity of mDelta1, we expressed a mDelta1 full-length cDNA in L cells using a eukaryotic expression vector. Effects of mDelta1 on cellular differentiation were examined in two independent systems, featuring C2C12 myogenic differentiation and multipotent murine bone marrow cell differentiation. Inhibition of the former was observed with mDelta1 expression on L cells, associated with suppression of myogenin, a myogenic transcription factor. Expression of mDelta1 in conjunction with GM-CSF promoted differentiation of bone marrow cells to myeloid dendritic cells at the expense of other lineages. Although the effects of mDelta1 on two differentiation systems appeared opposing, as inhibition occurring in one and induction in the other, this can be understood by the unifying concept of generation of diverse cell types from equivalent progenitors. Thus, the present study provided evidence that mammalian Delta participates in intercellular signaling, determining the cell fate in a wide variety of tissues.",2000,"T S Doi, M Yazaki, Y Wada, S Iwase, K Mizutani, Y Obata, T Takahashi, T Matsubayashi, K Kasai"
"Developmental genetics of the Drosophila gut: specification of primordia, subdivision and overt-differentiation",10512197,,"The Drosophila gut is composed of three major parts, the foregut, midgut and hindgut, which arise from anterior and posterior invaginations of the early blastoderm. We review the process of the specification of the gut primordia, subsequent subdivision and region-specific cell differentiation in terms of developmental genetics. Graded activities of maternal signals at anterior and posterior terminal domains of the blastoderm, being mediated by activities of two zygotic gap genes, tailless and huckebein, lead to the activation of key genes that determine the gut primordia: serpent (GATA factor gene) for the endodermal midgut; brachyenteron (Brachyury homolog) for the ectodermal hindgut. fork head (HNF-3 homolog) and caudal (Cdx homolog) are also essential for the development of all gut primordia or hindgut primordium, respectively. Subdivision of the midgut epithelium is regulated by inductive signals emanating from the visceral mesoderm, which is under the control of HOM-C genes. In contrast, pattern formation of the ectodermal foregut and hindgut is regulated by secreted signaling molecules, such as Wingless (Wnt homolog), Hedgehog and Decapentaplegic (Bmp-4 homolog), as in the case of segmented structures and imaginal discs. Finally, the gut is subdivided into at least 36 compartments that are recognized asminimum tissue units of regional differentiation. A few genes that are responsible for determining and maintaining the state of overt-differentiation of the compartments have also been reported. A marked feature of the genetic mechanism of the gut development is the unexpectedly wide spectrum of the similarities of relevant genes and regulatory pathways of gene expression between Drosophila and vertebrates, which may imply a prototypic style of body plan common to protostomes and deuterostomes.",1999,"R Murakami, T Hamaguchi, S Takashima"
hedgehog and engrailed: pattern formation and polarity in the Drosophila abdomen,10226002,,"Like the Drosophila embryo, the abdomen of the adult consists of alternating anterior (A) and posterior (P) compartments. However the wing is made by only part of one A and part of one P compartment. The abdomen therefore offers an opportunity to compare two compartment borders (A/P is within the segment and P/A intervenes between two segments), and ask if they act differently in pattern formation. In the embryo, abdomen and wing P compartment cells express the selector gene engrailed and secrete Hedgehog protein whilst A compartment cells need the patched and smoothened genes in order to respond to Hedgehog. We made clones of cells with altered activities of the engrailed, patched and smoothened genes. Our results confirm (1) that the state of engrailed, whether 'off' or 'on', determines whether a cell is of A or P type and (2) that Hedgehog signalling, coming from the adjacent P compartments across both A/P and P/A boundaries, organises the pattern of all the A cells. We have uncovered four new aspects of compartments and engrailed in the abdomen. First, we show that engrailed acts in the A compartment: Hedgehog leaves the P cells and crosses the A/P boundary where it induces engrailed in a narrow band of A cells. engrailed causes these cells to form a special type of cuticle. No similar effect occurs when Hedgehog crosses the P/A border. Second, we look at the polarity changes induced by the clones, and build a working hypothesis that polarity is organised, in both compartments, by molecule(s) emanating from the A/P but not the P/A boundaries. Third, we show that both the A and P compartments are each divided into anterior and posterior subdomains. This additional stratification makes the A/P and the P/A boundaries fundamentally distinct from each other. Finally, we find that when engrailed is removed from P cells (of, say, segment A5) they transform not into A cells of the same segment, but into A cells of the same parasegment (segment A6).",1999,"P A Lawrence, G Struhl, J Casal"
Allele loss on chromosome 9q22.2-22.3 in sporadic basal cell carcinoma in Chinese,11601325,,"Objective: To investigate the role of allele loss on chromosome 9 in the pathogenesis of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) by examining the loss of heterozygosity in sporadic basal cell carcinoma and other cutaneous tumors. Methods: DNA samples were isolated from the tumors, the matched adjacent normal skin and the blood of patients with sporadic basal cell carcinoma (14), squamous cell carcinoma (25) and Bowen's disease (5) by phenol-chloroform extraction. In our study, we used two microsatellite markers on chromosome 9, one was locus D9S319 (9p21), and the other was D9S299 (9q22.2-22.3). After PCR was performed, the samples were electrophoresed through 5% denatured polyacrylamide gels which were dried and exposed to Fuji XR films. Results: Loss of heterozygosity with D9S319 (9p21) marker was not observed in the 10 informative cases of sporadic basal cell carcinoma, 19 squamous cell carcinoma and 4 Bowen's disease. Allelic deletion of D9S299 was not seen in the 21 informative cases of squamous cell carcinoma and 4 Bowen's disease. D9S299 (9q22.2-22.3) allele loss occurred in 2 of the 10 informative cases of sporadic basal cell carcinoma, indicating that there might be a susceptible tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 9, and loss of this allele might play an important role in the development of basal cell carcinoma. Inactivation of Drosophila patch (PTCH) (MSSE gene ESS1) in BCC might be necessary, if not sufficient, for BCC carcinogenesis.

Commissure formation in the embryonic CNS of Drosophila,9895324,,Most of the neurons of the ventral nerve cord send out long projecting axons which cross the midline. In the Drosophila central nervous system (CNS) cells of the midline give rise to neuronal and glial lineages with different functions during the establishment of the commissural pattern. Here we present evidence that beside the previously known NETRIN/FRAZZLED (DCC) signalling system an additional attractive system(s) is operating in the developing embryonic nervous system of Drosophila. Attractive cues appear to be provided by the midline neurons. We show that the glial cells present repulsive signals to the previously described ROUNDABOUT receptor in addition to a permissive contact-dependent signal helping commissural growth cones across the midline. A novel repulsive component is encoded by the karussell gene. Furthermore the midline glial cells separate anterior and posterior commissures. By genetic criteria we demonstrate that some of the genes we have identified are acting in the midline glia whereas other genes are required in the midline neurons. The results lead to a detailed model relating different cellular functions to axonal patterning at the midline.,1999,"C Klämbt, K Schimmelpfeng, T Hummel"

We show that it is possible to generate pair-rule type phenocopies with defects in alternating segments. Interestingly, we find the defects in odd numbered segments and not in even numbered ones as in Drosophila. However, this apparent discrepancy can be explained if one takes into account that the primary action of eve is at the level of parasegments and that different cuticular markers are used for defining the segment borders in the two species. In this light, we find that eve appears to be required for the formation of the anterior borders of the same odd numbered parasegments in both species. We conclude that the primary function of eve as a pair rule gene is conserved between the two species.",1999,"D Tautz, D G Jay, R Schröder"
Gap-Junctional communication between developing Drosophila muscles is essential for their normal development,10079511,10.1002/(SICI)1520-6408(1999)24:1/2<57::AID-DVG7>3.0.CO;2-W,"Recent experiments have demonstrated that a family of proteins, known as the innexins, are structural components of invertebrate gap junctions. The shaking-B (shak-B) locus of Drosophila encodes two members of this emerging family, Shak-B(lethal) and Shak-B(neural). This study focuses on the role of Shak-B gap junctions in the development of embryonic and larval muscle. During embryogenesis, shak-B transcripts are expressed in a subset of the somatic muscles; expression is strong in ventral oblique muscles (VO4-6) but only weak in ventral longitudinals (VL3 and 4). Carboxyfluorescein injected into VO4 of wild-type early stage 16 embryos spreads, via gap junctions, to label adjacent muscles, including VL3 and 4. In shak-B2 embryos (in which the shak-B(neural) function is disrupted), dye injected into VO4 fails to spread into other muscles. In the first instar larva, when dye coupling between muscles is no longer present, another effect of the shak-B2 mutation is revealed by whole-cell voltage clamp. In a calcium-free saline, only two voltage-activated potassium currents are present in wild-type muscles; a fast IA and a slow IK current. In shak-B2 larvae, these two currents are significantly reduced in magnitude in VO4 and 5, but remain normal in VL3. Expression of shak-B(neural) in a shak-B2 background fully rescues both dye coupling in embryonic muscle and whole-cell currents in first instar VO4 and 5. Our observations show that Shak-B(neural) is one of a set of embryonic gap-junction proteins, and that it is required for the normal temporal development of potassium currents in some larval muscles.",1999,"R A Baines, L A Stebbings, J A Davies, J P Bacon, M G Todman"
Nuclear entry of the Drosophila melanogaster nuclear lamina protein YA correlates with developmentally regulated changes in its phosphorylation state,10364432,10.1006/dbio.1999.9264,"The Drosophila melanogaster YA protein is a maternally provided nuclear lamina component that is essential during the transition from meiosis to mitosis at the beginning of embryogenesis. Localization of YA to the nuclear envelope is required for its function; this localization is cell cycle-dependent during embryogenesis. Here we show that the ability of YA to enter nuclei is modulated during development. In developing egg chambers, YA protein is made but excluded from nuclei of nurse cells and oocytes; upon egg activation, YA acquires the ability to enter nuclei and becomes incorporated into the nuclear lamina in unfertilized eggs and embryos. This localization switch correlates with changes in the phosphorylation state of YA. YA in ovaries is hyperphosphorylated relative to YA in unfertilized eggs and embryos. Through site-directed mutagenesis, we identified 443T, a potential phosphorylation site for both cyclin-dependent protein kinase and mitogen-activated-protein kinase, as one of the sites likely involved in this developmental control. Our results suggest that phosphorylation plays a role in modulating the localization of YA during development.

Recent DiI cell lineage studies have begun to elucidate the family of neurons and glia produced by each Drosophila embryonic neural precursor (neuroblast). Here we use DiI labeling to extend and clarify previous studies, but our analysis differs from previous studies in four major features: we analyze and compare lineages of every known embryonic neuroblast; we use an in vivo landmark (engrailed-GFP) to increase the accuracy of neuroblast identification; we use confocal fluorescence and Nomarski microscopy to collect three-dimensional data in living embryos simultaneously for each DiI-labeled clone, the engrailed-GFP landmark, and the entire CNS and muscle target field (Nomarski images); and finally, we analyze clones very late in embryonic development, which reveals novel cell types and axon/dendrite complexity. We identify the parental neuroblasts for all the cell types of the embryonic CNS: motoneurons, intersegmental interneurons, local interneurons, glia and neurosecretory cells (whose origins had never been determined). We identify muscle contacts for every thoracic and abdominal motoneuron at stage 17. We define the parental neuroblasts for neurons or glia expressing well-known molecular markers or neurotransmitters. We correlate Drosophila cell lineage data with information derived from other insects. In addition, we make the following novel conclusions: (1) neuroblasts at similar dorsoventral positions, but not anteroposterior positions, often generate similar cell lineages, and (2) neuroblasts at similar dorsoventral positions often produce the same motoneuron subtype: ventral neuroblasts typically generate motoneurons with dorsal muscle targets, while dorsal neuroblasts produce motoneurons with ventral muscle targets.

Chaos and birhythmicity in a model for circadian oscillations of the PER and TIM proteins in drosophila,10366496,10.1006/jtbi.1999.0924,"In Drosophila, circadian oscillations in the levels of two proteins, PER and TIM, result from the negative feedback exerted by a PER-TIM complex on the expression of the per and tim genes which code for these two proteins. On the basis of these experimental observations, we have recently proposed a theoretical model for circadian oscillations of the PER and TIM proteins in Drosophila. Here we show that for constant environmental conditions this model is capable of generating autonomous chaotic oscillations. For other parameter values, the model can also display birhythmicity, i.e. the coexistence between two stable regimes of limit cycle oscillations. We analyse the occurrence of chaos and birhythmicity by means of bifurcation diagrams and locate the different domains of complex oscillatory behavior in parameter space. The relative smallness of these domains raises doubts as to the possible physiological significance of chaos and birhythmicity in regard to circadian rhythm generation.

Expression of Mash1 in basal cells of rat circumvallate taste buds is dependent upon gustatory innervation,10037145,10.1016/s0014-5793(99)00023-x,"Mash1, a mammalian homologue of the Drosophila achaete-scute proneural gene complex, plays an essential role in differentiation of subsets of peripheral neurons. In this study, using RT-PCR and in situ RT-PCR, we investigated if Mash1 gene expression occurs in rat taste buds. Further, we examined dynamics of Mash1 expression in the process of degeneration and regeneration in denervated rat taste buds. In rat tongue epithelium, Mash1 gene expression is confined to circumvallate, foliate, and fungiform papilla epithelia that include taste buds. In taste buds, Mash1-expressing cells are round cells in the basal compartment. In contrast, the mature taste bud cells do not express the Mash1 gene. Denervation and regeneration experiments show that the expression of Mash1 requires gustatory innervation. We conclude that Mash1 is expressed in cells of the taste bud lineage, and that the expression of Mash1 in rat taste buds is dependent upon gustatory innervation.",1999,"S Takeda, T Toyono, Y Seta, K Toyoshima"
Functional analysis of human Smad1: role of the amino-terminal domain,10329393,10.1006/bbrc.1999.0598,"The signals originating from transforming growth factor beta/activin/bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are transduced by a set of evolutionarily conserved family of Smad proteins which, upon activation, directly translocate to the nucleus where they may activate transcription. Smad proteins of different species contain conserved amino- (N) and carboxy- (C) terminal domains separated by a proline-rich linker. Human, Drosophila, and Xenopus Smad1 all have been shown to mediate the biological effects of BMP-4 in Xenopus embryos. We have investigated the functional domains of human Smad1 (hSmad1) using the Xenopus embryo system. Dorsal injection of hSmad1 RNA into the 4-cell-stage embryos results in embryonic ventralization. Since the C-terminus of Smads has been shown to mediate the transcriptional activity, whereas this activity is masked by the presence of the N-terminus, we tested the effect of a hSmad1 construct lacking the C-terminal domain [hSmad1(N)] in the Xenopus embryo system. Surprisingly, we found that hSmad1(N) not only synergizes with hSmad1 in embryonic ventralization, but induces ventralization by itself. Ectopic expression of a dominant negative BMP receptor (DN-BR) as well as neural inducers noggin and chordin induce neurogenesis in the animal cap, which is inhibited by co-expression of either hSmad1 or hSmad1(N). Ventral expression of DN-BR induces formation of a second body axis at tailbud stage, which is also prevented by hSmad1 and hSmad1(N). It has recently been reported that calmodulin interacts with the N-terminal domain of Smad proteins. We demonstrate that the ventralizing activity of hSmad1 and hSmad1(N) is markedly inhibited by calmodulin. Thus, calmodulin acts as a Smad1 inhibitor. A model is proposed to accomodate these findings.",1999,"H M Shih, A B Roberts, R J Lechleider, R H Xu, H f Kung, D Sredni, C F Hao"
Altered outward K(+) currents in Drosophila larval neurons of memory mutants rutabaga and amnesiac,10413447,10.1002/(sici)1097-4695(199908)40:2<158::aid-neu3>3.0.co;2-#,"K(+) currents in cultured Drosophila larval neurons have been classified into four categories according to their inactivation time constants, relative amplitude, and response to K(+) channel blockers 4-AP and tetraethylammonium.

Homeodomain-derived peptides. In and out of the cells,10667213,10.1111/j.1749-6632.1999.tb09410.x,"The internalization of homeodomains and of homeopeptides derived from the third helix of the homeodomain of Antennapedia, a Drosophila transcription factor, is used by some investigators to target exogenous hydrophilic compounds into live cells. In addition to this very practical aspect of drug delivery, translocation across biologic membranes of peptides subsequently addressed to the cell cytoplasm and nucleus raises several questions. A first series of questions pertains to the mechanism of translocation. Thanks to the synthesis of several peptides derived from the third helix of the Antennapedia homeodomain, we began to investigate the mechanism of translocation and we have shown that it is not dependent upon the presence of a chiral receptor and probably involves the formation of inverted micelles. A second series of questions is related to the physiologic significance of the phenomenon. In a first approach, we demonstrated that some full-length homeoproteins are internalized and secreted in vitro. The mechanism of internalization is probably similar to that of the homeodomain or of its third helix, but secretion involves a different mechanism which requires an association with specialized intracellular membranous structures. The existence of specific mechanisms for homeoprotein internalization and secretion suggests that this class of transcription factors may have important signaling properties.",1999,A Prochiantz

Temporal pattern of locomotor activity in Drosophila melanogaster,10077864,10.1007/s003590050307,"The temporal pattern of locomotor activity of single Drosophila melanogaster flies freely walking in small tubes is described. Locomotor activity monitored by a light gate has a characteristic time-course that depends upon age and the environmental conditions. Several methods are applied to assess the complexity of the temporal pattern. The pattern varies according to sex, genotype, age and environmental conditions (food; light). Activity occurs clustered in bouts. The intrinsic bout structure is quantified by four parameters: number of light gate passages (counts) per bout, duration of a bout, pause between two successive bouts and mean bout period. In addition, the distribution of the periods between light-gate crossings (inter-count intervals) as function of inter-count interval duration reveals a power law, suggesting that the overall distribution of episodes of activity and inactivity has a fractal structure. In the dark without food, the fractal dimension which represents a measure of the complexity of the pattern is sex, genotype and age specific. Fractality is abolished by additional sensory stimulation (food; light). We propose that time-course, bout structure and fractal dimension of the temporal pattern of locomotor activity describe different aspects of the fly's central pattern generator for locomotion and its motivational control.",1999,"J R Martin, M Heisenberg, R Ernst"
"Mutations in FIE, a WD polycomb group gene, allow endosperm development without fertilization",10072400,10.1105/tpc.11.3.407,"A fundamental problem in biology is to understand how fertilization initiates reproductive development. Higher plant reproduction is unique because two fertilization events are required for sexual reproduction. First, a sperm must fuse with the egg to form an embryo. A second sperm must then fuse with the adjacent central cell nucleus that replicates to form an endosperm, which is the support tissue required for embryo and/or seedling development. Here, we report cloning of the Arabidopsis FERTILIZATION-INDEPENDENT ENDOSPERM (FIE) gene. The FIE protein is a homolog of the WD motif-containing Polycomb proteins from Drosophila and mammals. These proteins function as repressors of homeotic genes. A female gametophyte with a loss-of-function allele of fie undergoes replication of the central cell nucleus and initiates endosperm development without fertilization. These results suggest that the FIE Polycomb protein functions to suppress a critical aspect of early plant reproduction, namely, endosperm development, until fertilization occurs.",1999,"L Margossian, N Ohad, R Yadegari, R L Fischer, J J Harada, R B Goldberg, M Hannon, D Michaeli"
Latitudinal variation in eclosion rhythm among strains of Drosophila ananassae,10522160,,"Eclosion rhythm parameters of D. ananassae strains originating between 8 degrees-34 degrees N were highly variable and latitude dependent. In the field under naturally fluctuating light intensity, temperature and R.H., the amplitude of the rhythm was high and the eclosion gate was narrow; however, under the naturally fluctuating light intensity but at constant temperature and R.H., the amplitude of the rhythm was lowered and the width of eclosion gate was widened. The eclosion rhythm entrained to light-dark (LD) cycles ranging from LD 6:18 to LD 18:6, the width of the eclosion gate was decreased and increased in the short and long photoperiods respectively. Among the strains, both the phase angle difference (psi, the time from lights-off in a 24 hr LD cycle to the eclosion median) and the period of free-running rhythm (tau) in constant darkness varied by about 3 hr and the amplitude of the rhythmicity (Amp) by about 10%.

Toll4 (TLR4) expression in cardiac myocytes in normal and failing myocardium,10430608,10.1172/JCI6709,"Expression of innate immune response proteins, including IL-1beta, TNF, and the cytokine-inducible isoform of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), have been documented in the hearts of humans and experimental animals with heart failure regardless of etiology, although the proximal events leading to their expression are unknown. Noting that expression of a human homologue of Drosophila Toll, a proximal innate immunity transmembrane signaling protein in the fly, now termed human Toll-like receptor 4 (hTLR4), appeared to be relatively high in the heart, we examined TLR4 mRNA and protein abundance in isolated cellular constituents of cardiac muscle and in normal and abnormal murine, rat, and human myocardium. TLR4 expression levels in cardiac myocytes and in coronary microvascular endothelial cells could be enhanced by either LPS or IL-1beta, an effect inhibited by the oxygen radical scavenger PDTC. Transfection of a constitutively active TLR4 construct, CD4/hTLR4, resulted in activation of a nuclear factor-kappaB reporter construct, but not of an AP-1 or an iNOS reporter construct, in cardiac myocytes. In normal murine, rat, and human myocardium, TLR4 expression was diffuse, and presumably cytoplasmic, in cardiac myocytes. However, in remodeling murine myocardium remote from sites of ischemic injury and in heart tissue from patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, focal areas of intense TLR4 staining were observed in juxtaposed regions of 2 or more adjacent myocytes; this staining was not observed in control myocardium. Increased expression and signaling by TLR4, and perhaps other Toll homologues, may contribute to the activation of innate immunity in injured myocardium.",1999,"R A Kelly, R Medzhitov, L Kobzik, R Fukazawa, Y D Kim, R T Lee, S Frantz"
Engineering a mouse balancer chromosome,10431243,10.1038/11949,"Balancer chromosomes are genetic reagents that are used in Drosophila melanogaster for stock maintenance and mutagenesis screens. Despite their utility, balancer chromosomes are rarely used in mice because they are difficult to generate using conventional methods. Here we describe the engineering of a mouse balancer chromosome with the Cre-loxP recombination system. The chromosome features a 24-centiMorgan (cM) inversion between Trp53 (also known as p53) and Wnt3 on mouse chromosome 11 that is recessive lethal and dominantly marked with a K14-Agouti transgene. When allelic to a wild-type chromosome, the inversion suppresses crossing over in the inversion interval, accompanied by elevated recombination in the flanking regions. The inversion functions as a balancer chromosome because it can be used to maintain a lethal mutation in the inversion interval as a self-sustaining trans-heterozygous stock. This strategy can be used to generate similar genetic reagents throughout the mouse genome. Engineering of visibly marked inversions and deficiencies is an important step toward functional analyses of the mouse genome and will facilitate large-scale mutagenesis programs.",1999,"Y C Cheah, W W Cai, D M Thompson, B C Tavsanli, M Sage, B Zheng, A Bradley"
Concerted evolution within a trypsin gene cluster in Drosophila,10486967,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a026202,"A cluster of four trypsin genes has previously been localized to cytological position 47D-F of the Drosophila melanogaster genome. One of these genes had been sequenced, and the presence of the other three genes was identified by cross-hybridization. Here, we present the DNA sequence of the entire genomic region encoding these four trypsin genes. In addition to the four previously inferred genes, we have identified a fifth trypsin-coding sequence located within this gene cluster. This new gene shows a high degree of sequence divergence (more than 30%) from the other four genes, although it retains all of the functional motifs that are characteristic of trypsin-coding sequences. In order to trace the molecular evolution of this gene cluster, we isolated and sequenced the homologous 7-kb region from the closely related species Drosophila erecta. A comparison of the DNA sequences between the two species provides strong evidence for the concerted evolution of some members of this gene family. Two genes within the cluster are evolving in concert, while a third gene appears to be evolving independently. The remaining two genes show an intermediate pattern of evolution. We propose a simple model, involving chromosome looping and gene conversion, to explain the relatively complex patterns of molecular evolution within this gene cluster.",1999,"S Wang, C Magoulas, D Hickey"
Ecdysone response genes govern egg chamber development during mid-oogenesis in Drosophila,10498692,,"The steroid hormone ecdysone regulates larval development and metamorphosis in Drosophila melanogaster through a complex genetic hierarchy that begins with a small set of early response genes. Here, we present data indicating that the ecdysone response hierarchy also mediates egg chamber maturation during mid-oogenesis. E75, E74 and BR-C are expressed in a stage-specific manner while EcR expression is ubiquitous throughout oogenesis. Decreasing or increasing the ovarian ecdysone titer using a temperature-sensitive mutation or exogenous ecdysone results in corresponding changes in early gene expression. The stage 10 follicle cell expression of E75 in wild-type, K10 and EGF receptor (Egfr) mutant egg chambers reveals regulation of E75 by both the Egfr and ecdysone signaling pathways. Genetic analysis indicates a germline requirement for ecdysone-responsive gene expression. Germline clones of E75 mutations arrest and degenerate during mid-oogenesis and EcR germline clones exhibit a similar phenotype, demonstrating a functional requirement for ecdysone responsiveness during the vitellogenic phase of oogenesis. Finally, the expression of Drosophila Adrenodoxin Reductase increases during mid-oogenesis and clonal analysis confirms that this steroidogenic enzyme is required in the germline for egg chamber development. Together these data suggest that the temporal expression profile of E75, E74 and BR-C may be a functional reflection of ecdysone levels and that ecdysone provides temporal signals regulating the progression of oogenesis and proper specification of dorsal follicle cell fates.",1999,"M Buszczak, M R Freeman, W A Segraves, L Cooley, M Bender, J R Carlson"
Functional expression of human and Arabidopsis protein phosphatase 2A in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and isolation of dominant-defective mutants,10393236,10.1016/s0378-1119(99)00188-2,"Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a heterotrimeric serine/threonine-specific protein phosphatase, comprises a catalytic subunit and two distinct regulatory subunits, A and B. The primary sequence of the catalytic (C) subunit is highly conserved in evolution, and its function has been shown to be essential in yeast, Drosophila and mice. In many eukaryotes, the C subunit is encoded by at least two nearly identical genes, impeding conventional loss-of-function genetic analysis. We report here the development of a functional complementation assay in S. cerevisiae that has allowed us to isolate dominant-defective alleles of human and Arabidopsis C subunit genes. Wild-type human and Arabidopsis C subunit genes can complement the lethal phenotype of S. cerevisiae PP2A-C mutations. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to create two distinct, catalytically impaired C subunit mutants of the human and Arabidopsis genes. In both cases, expression of the mutant subunit in yeast prevented growth, even in the presence of functional C subunit proteins. This dominant growth defect is consistent with a dominant-interfering mode of action. Thus, we have shown that S. cerevisiae provides a rapid system for the functional analysis of heterologous PP2A genes, and that two mutations that abrogate phosphatase activity exhibit dominant-defective phenotypes in S. cerevisiae.",1999,"A DeLong, D D McManus, D L Lizotte, H R Cohen"
Wingless modulates the effects of dominant negative notch molecules in the developing wing of Drosophila,10588873,10.1006/dbio.1999.9502,"The development and patterning of the wing in Drosophila relies on a sequence of cell interactions molecularly driven by a number of ligands and receptors. Genetic analysis indicates that a receptor encoded by the Notch gene and a signal encoded by the wingless gene play a number of interdependent roles in this process and display very strong functional interactions. At certain times and places, during wing development, the expression of wingless requires Notch activity and that of its ligands Delta and Serrate. This has led to the proposal that all the interactions between Notch and wingless can be understood in terms of this regulatory relationship. Here we have tested this proposal by analysing interactions between Delta- and Serrate-activated Notch signalling and Wingless signalling during wing development and patterning. We find that the cell death caused by expressing dominant negative Notch molecules during wing development cannot be rescued by coexpressing Nintra. This suggests that the dominant negative Notch molecules cannot only disrupt Delta and Serrate signalling but can also disrupt signalling through another pathway. One possibility is the Wingless signalling pathway as the cell death caused by expressing dominant negative Notch molecules can be rescued by activating Wingless signalling. Furthermore, we observe that the outcome of the interactions between Notch and Wingless signalling differs when we activate Wingless signalling by expressing either Wingless itself or an activated form of the Armadillo. For example, the effect of expressing the activated form of Armadillo with a dominant negative Notch on the patterning of sense organ precursors in the wing resembles the effects of expressing Wingless alone. This result suggests that signalling activated by Wingless leads to two effects, a reduction of Notch signalling and an activation of Armadillo.",1999,"T Klein, A M Arias, E Wilder, K Brennan"
Activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors enhances synaptic transmission at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction,10340302,10.1016/s0028-3908(98)00232-9,"We examined the effects of activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) on glutamatergic synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction of newly hatched Drosophila larvae. In nominally Ca(2+)-free solutions puff-application of low concentrations of glutamate evoked a transient frequency increase of miniature synaptic currents (mSCs). The mean amplitude of mSCs was unaffected, suggesting that this effect was presynaptic. Similar alterations of the mSC frequency were obtained using the mGluR agonists, (S)-4C3HPG, DCG-IV, or (1S,3S)-ACPD, but not when using agonists for ionotropic glutamate receptors, NMDA, AMPA or kainate. An mGluR antagonist, MCCG-I, blocked the effect of agonists on the mSC frequency. An adenylate cyclase activator, forskolin, and a cAMP analog, CPT-cAMP, mimicked the effects of mGluR activation. Meanwhile, an adenylate cyclase inhibitor, SQ22,536, blocked the mGluR agonist-induced effects, and in rutabaga, an adenylate-cyclase-defective mutant, the effect of the agonist was greatly reduced. In the presence of external Ca2+, (S)-4C3HPG decreased the failure rate and increased the mean amplitude of stimulus-evoked SCs, while MCCG-I decreased the amplitudes. We suggest that at the larval Drosophila neuromuscular junction endogenous glutamate released at the terminal potentiates synaptic transmission via a process involving cAMP.",1999,"Y Kidokoro, D Zhang, H Kuromi"

Uncovering the link between malfunctions in Drosophila neuroblast asymmetric cell division and tumorigenesis,23151376,10.1186/2045-3701-2-38,"Asymmetric cell division is a developmental process utilized by several organisms. On the most basic level, an asymmetric division produces two daughter cells, each possessing a different identity or fate. Drosophila melanogaster progenitor cells, referred to as neuroblasts, undergo asymmetric division to produce a daughter neuroblast and another cell known as a ganglion mother cell (GMC). There are several features of asymmetric division in Drosophila that make it a very complex process, and these aspects will be discussed at length. The cell fate determinants that play a role in specifying daughter cell fate, as well as the mechanisms behind setting up cortical polarity within neuroblasts, have proved to be essential to ensuring that neurogenesis occurs properly. The role that mitotic spindle orientation plays in coordinating asymmetric division, as well as how cell cycle regulators influence asymmetric division machinery, will also be addressed. Most significantly, malfunctions during asymmetric cell division have shown to be causally linked with neoplastic growth and tumor formation. Therefore, it is imperative that the developmental repercussions as a result of asymmetric cell division gone awry be understood.",2012,"Wange Lu, Corey Kelsom"
Chromatin evolution and molecular drive in speciation,22191063,10.1155/2012/301894,"Are there biological generalities that underlie hybrid sterility or inviability? Recently, around a dozen ""speciation genes"" have been identified mainly in Drosophila, and the biological functions of these genes are revealing molecular generalities. Major cases of hybrid sterility and inviability seem to result from chromatin evolution and molecular drive in speciation. Repetitive satellite DNAs within heterochromatin, especially at centromeres, evolve rapidly through molecular drive mechanisms (both meiotic and centromeric). Chromatin-binding proteins, therefore, must also evolve rapidly to maintain binding capability. As a result, chromatin binding proteins may not be able to interact with chromosomes from another species in a hybrid, causing hybrid sterility and inviability.",2012,Kyoichi Sawamura
Drosophila muscleblind codes for proteins with one and two tandem zinc finger motifs,22479576,10.1371/journal.pone.0034248,"Muscleblind-like proteins, Muscleblind (Mbl) in Drosophila and MBNL1-3 in vertebrates, are regulators of alternative splicing. Human MBNL1 is a key factor in the etiology of myotonic dystrophy (DM), a muscle wasting disease caused by the occurrence of toxic RNA molecules containing CUG/CCUG repeats. MBNL1 binds to these RNAs and is sequestered in nuclear foci preventing it from exerting its normal function, which ultimately leads to mis-spliced mRNAs, a major cause of the disease. Muscleblind-proteins bind to RNAs via N-terminal zinc fingers of the Cys(3)-His type. These zinc fingers are arranged in one (invertebrates) or two (vertebrates) tandem zinc finger (TZF) motifs with both fingers targeting GC steps in the RNA molecule. Here I show that mbl genes in Drosophila and in other insects also encode proteins with two TZF motifs, highly similar to vertebrate MBNL proteins. In Drosophila the different protein isoforms have overlapping but possibly divergent functions in vivo, evident by their unequal capacities to rescue the splicing defects observed in mbl mutant embryos. In addition, using whole transcriptome analysis, I identified several new splicing targets for Mbl in Drosophila embryos. Two of these novel targets, kkv (krotzkopf-verkehrt, coding for Chitin Synthase 1) and cora (coracle, coding for the Drosophila homolog of Protein 4.1), are not muscle-specific but expressed mainly in epidermal cells, indicating a function for mbl not only in muscles and the nervous system.",2012,Uwe Irion

One such mechanism is male killing (MK), in which sons of infected mothers are killed by the endosymbiont during development. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the advantages of MK, including resource reallocation from sons to daughters of infected females, avoidance of inbreeding by infected females, and, if transmission is not purely maternal, the facilitation of horizontal transmission to uninfected females. We tested these hypotheses in Drosophila innubila, a mycophagous species infected with MK Wolbachia. There was no evidence of horizontal transmission in the wild and no evidence Wolbachia reduced levels of inbreeding. Resource reallocation does appear to be operative, as Wolbachia-infected females are slightly larger, on average, than uninfected females, although the selective advantage of larger size is insufficient to account for the frequency of infection in natural populations. Wolbachia-infected females from the wild-although not those from the laboratory-were more fecund than uninfected females. Experimental studies revealed that Wolbachia can boost the fecundity of nutrient-deprived flies and reduce the adverse effect of RNA virus infection. Thus, this MK endosymbiont can provide direct, MK-independent fitness benefits to infected female hosts in addition to possible benefits mediated via MK.",2012,"Robert L Unckless, John Jaenike"

We had previously found that Eny2 expression changes in mouse pancreatic islets during the metabolic adaptation to pregnancy. We therefore hypothesized that the protein contributes to the regulation of islet endocrine cell function and tested this hypothesis in rat INS-1E insulinoma cells. Overexpression of Eny2 had no effect but siRNA-mediated knockdown of Eny2 resulted in markedly increased glucose and exendin-4-induced insulin secretion from otherwise poorly glucose-responsive INS-1E cells. Insulin content, cellular viability, and the expression levels of several key components of glucose sensing remained unchanged; however glucose-dependent cellular metabolism was higher after Eny2 knockdown. Suppression of Eny2 enhanced the intracellular incretin signal downstream of cAMP. The use of specific cAMP analogues and pathway inhibitors primarily implicated the PKA and to a lesser extent the EPAC pathway. In summary, we identified a potential link between the nuclear protein Eny2 and insulin secretion. Suppression of Eny2 resulted in increased glucose and incretin-induced insulin release from a poorly glucose-responsive INS-1E subline.

Although rickettsiae require the host cell actin cytoskeleton for invasion, the cytoskeletal proteins that mediate this process have not been completely described. To identify the host factors important during cell invasion by Rickettsia parkeri, a member of the spotted fever group (SFG), we performed an RNAi screen targeting 105 proteins in Drosophila melanogaster S2R+ cells. The screen identified 21 core proteins important for invasion, including the GTPases Rac1 and Rac2, the WAVE nucleation-promoting factor complex and the Arp2/3 complex. In mammalian cells, including endothelial cells, the natural targets of R. parkeri, the Arp2/3 complex was also crucial for invasion, while requirements for WAVE2 as well as Rho GTPases depended on the particular cell type. We propose that R. parkeri invades S2R+ arthropod cells through a primary pathway leading to actin nucleation, whereas invasion of mammalian endothelial cells occurs via redundant pathways that converge on the host Arp2/3 complex. Our results reveal a key role for the WAVE and Arp2/3 complexes, as well as a higher degree of variation than previously appreciated in actin nucleation pathways activated during Rickettsia invasion.",2012,"Matthew D Welch, Alisa W Serio, Shawna C O Reed"
Transduction in Drosophila olfactory receptor neurons is invariant to air speed,22815404,10.1152/jn.01146.2011,"In the vertebrate nose, increasing air speed tends to increase the magnitude of odor-evoked activity in olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs), given constant odor concentration and duration. It is often assumed that the same is true of insect olfactory organs, but this has not been directly tested. In this study, we examined the effect of air speed on ORN responses in Drosophila melanogaster. We constructed an odor delivery device that allowed us to independently vary concentration and air speed, and we used a fast photoionization detector to precisely measure the actual odor concentration at the antenna while simultaneously recording spikes from ORNs in vivo. Our results demonstrate that Drosophila ORN odor responses are invariant to air speed, as long as odor concentration is kept constant. This finding was true across a >100-fold range of air speeds. Because odor hydrophobicity has been proposed to affect the air speed dependence of olfactory transduction, we tested a >1,000-fold range of hydrophobicity values and found that ORN responses are invariant to air speed across this full range. These results have implications for the mechanisms of odor delivery to Drosophila ORNs. Our findings are also significant because flies have a limited ability to control air flow across their antennae, unlike terrestrial vertebrates, which can control air flow within their nasal cavity. Thus, for the fly, invariance to air speed may be adaptive because it confers robustness to changing wind conditions.",2012,"Yi Zhou, Rachel I Wilson"

Conserved structural motifs at the C-terminus of baculovirus protein IE0 are important for its functions in transactivation and supporting hr5-mediated DNA replication,22754648,10.3390/v4050761,"IE0 and IE1 are transactivator proteins of the most studied baculovirus, the Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV). IE0 is a 72.6 kDa protein identical to IE1 with the exception of its 54 N-terminal amino acid residues. To gain some insight about important structural motifs of IE0, we expressed the protein and C‑terminal mutants of it under the control of the Drosophila heat shock promoter and studied the transactivation and replication functions of the transiently expressed proteins. IE0 was able to promote replication of a plasmid bearing the hr5 origin of replication of AcMNPV in transient transfections with a battery of eight plasmids expressing the AcMNPV genes dnapol, helicase, lef-1, lef-2, lef-3, p35, ie-2 and lef-7. IE0 transactivated expression of the baculovirus 39K promoter. Both functions of replication and transactivation were lost after introduction of selected mutations at the basic domain II and helix-loop-helix conserved structural motifs in the C-terminus of the protein.

Fascin controls neuronal class-specific dendrite arbor morphology,22764047,10.1242/dev.077800,"The branched morphology of dendrites represents a functional hallmark of distinct neuronal types. Nonetheless, how diverse neuronal class-specific dendrite branches are generated is not understood. We investigated specific classes of sensory neurons of Drosophila larvae to address the fundamental mechanisms underlying the formation of distinct branch types. We addressed the function of fascin, a conserved actin-bundling protein involved in filopodium formation, in class III and class IV sensory neurons. We found that the terminal branchlets of different classes of neurons have distinctive dynamics and are formed on the basis of molecularly separable mechanisms; in particular, class III neurons require fascin for terminal branching whereas class IV neurons do not. In class III neurons, fascin controls the formation and dynamics of terminal branchlets. Previous studies have shown that transcription factor combinations define dendrite patterns; we find that fascin represents a downstream component of such programs, as it is a major effector of the transcription factor Cut in defining class III-specific dendrite morphology. Furthermore, fascin defines the morphological distinction between class III and class IV neurons. In fact, loss of fascin function leads to a partial conversion of class III neurons to class IV characteristics, while the reverse effect is obtained by fascin overexpression in class IV neurons. We propose that dedicated molecular mechanisms underlie the formation and dynamics of distinct dendrite branch types to elicit the accurate establishment of neuronal circuits.",2012,"Julia Nagel, Caroline Delandre, Gaia Tavosanis, Friedrich Förstner, Adrian W Moore, Yun Zhang"

The total decrease in the level of the CG5017, hsp 70, Dll, and laws gene expression level was shown to promote a loss of the segmented pattern of distal structures of legs and antennae and a reversion of Drosophila limb morphogenesis to the evolutionarily earlier progenitors of insects.

Synaptic activity in serotonergic neurons is required for air-puff stimulated flight in Drosophila melanogaster,23029511,10.1371/journal.pone.0046405,"Background: Flight is an integral component of many complex behavioral patterns in insects. The giant fiber circuit has been well studied in several insects including Drosophila. However, components of the insect flight circuit that respond to an air-puff stimulus and comprise the flight central pattern generator are poorly defined. Aminergic neurons have been implicated in locust, moth and Drosophila flight. Here we have investigated the requirement of neuronal activity in serotonergic neurons, during development and in adults, on air-puff induced flight in Drosophila. Methodology/principal findings: To target serotonergic neurons specifically, a Drosophila strain that contains regulatory regions from the TRH (Tryptophan Hydroxylase) gene linked to the yeast transcription factor GAL4 was used. By blocking synaptic transmission from serotonergic neurons with a tetanus toxin transgene or by hyperpolarisation with Kir2.1, close to 50% adults became flightless. Temporal expression of a temperature sensitive Dynamin mutant transgene (Shi(ts)) suggests that synaptic function in serotonergic neurons is required both during development and in adults. Depletion of IP(3)R in serotonergic neurons via RNAi did not affect flight. Interestingly, at all stages a partial requirement for synaptic activity in serotonergic neurons was observed. The status of serotonergic neurons was investigated in the central nervous system of larvae and adults expressing tetanus toxin. A small but significant reduction was observed in serotonergic cell number in adult second thoracic segments from flightless tetanus toxin expressing animals. Conclusions: These studies show that loss of synaptic activity in serotonergic neurons causes a flight deficit. The temporal focus of the flight deficit is during pupal development and in adults. The cause of the flight deficit is likely to be loss of neurons and reduced synaptic function. Based on the partial phenotypes, serotonergic neurons appear to be modulatory, rather than an intrinsic part of the flight circuit.",2012,"Sufia Sadaf, Gaiti Hasan, Serge Birman"
"Molecular characterization of a ryanodine receptor gene in the rice leaffolder, Cnaphalocrocis medinalis (Guenée)",22567170,10.1371/journal.pone.0036623,"Ryanodine receptors (RyRs) are the targets of two novel classes of synthetic insecticidal chemicals, phthalic acid diamides and anthranilic diamides. Isolation of full-length RyR cDNAs is a critical step towards the structural and functional characterization of insect RyRs and an understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the species selective toxicity of diamide insecticides. However, there has been little research on the insect RyR genes due to the high molecular weight of the RyR proteins. In this study, we isolated a full-length RyR cDNA (named as CmRyR) from Cnaphalocrocis medinalis, an important rice pest throughout Southeast Asia. The composite CmRyR gene contains an ORF of 15264 bp encoding a protein of 5087 amino acid residues, which shares 79% overall identity with its Drosophila melanogaster homologue. All hallmarks of the RyR proteins are conserved in the CmRyR protein, suggesting that CmRyR is a structural and functional analogue of known RyRs. A multiple sequence alignment illustrates that the insect RyRs share high levels of amino acid sequence identity at the the COOH-terminal region. However, the amino acid residues analogous to the CmRyR residues N(4922), N(4924), N(4935), L(4950), L(4981), N(5013) and T(5064) are unique to lepidopteran RyRs compared with non-lepidopteran insect RyRs. This finding suggests that these residues may be involved in the differences in channel properties between lepidopteran and non-lepidopteran insect RyRs and in the species selective toxicity of diamide insecticides. Furthermore, two alternative splicing sites were identified in the CmRyR gene, one of which was located in the central part of the predicted second SPRY domain. Diagnostic PCR showed that the inclusion frequencies of two mutually exclusive exons (a/b) and one optional exon (c) differed between developmental stages or adult anatomical regions.

The temperature treatments were Low (25 °C), High (29 °C) and Variable (18 h at 29 °C, 6 h at 34 °C). Although the Variable treatment reduced survivorship and body size, absolute comb size and fluctuating asymmetry generally were invariant across treatments. In contrast, comb phenodeviance increased with stress in both populations. Phenodeviance in one comb segment (C2) increased sharply with stress, whereas phenodeviance in a second major segment (C1) also increased with stress but only in Noumea flies.

Circadian regulation of glutathione levels and biosynthesis in Drosophila melanogaster,23226288,10.1371/journal.pone.0050454,"Circadian clocks generate daily rhythms in neuronal, physiological, and metabolic functions. Previous studies in mammals reported daily fluctuations in levels of the major endogenous antioxidant, glutathione (GSH), but the molecular mechanisms that govern such fluctuations remained unknown. To address this question, we used the model species Drosophila, which has a rich arsenal of genetic tools. Previously, we showed that loss of the circadian clock increased oxidative damage and caused neurodegenerative changes in the brain, while enhanced GSH production in neuronal tissue conferred beneficial effects on fly survivorship under normal and stress conditions. In the current study we report that the GSH concentrations in fly heads fluctuate in a circadian clock-dependent manner. We further demonstrate a rhythm in activity of glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL), the rate-limiting enzyme in glutathione biosynthesis. Significant rhythms were also observed for mRNA levels of genes encoding the catalytic (Gclc) and modulatory (Gclm) subunits comprising the GCL holoenzyme. Furthermore, we found that the expression of a glutathione S-transferase, GstD1, which utilizes GSH in cellular detoxification, significantly fluctuated during the circadian day. To directly address the role of the clock in regulating GSH-related rhythms, the expression levels of the GCL subunits and GstD1, as well as GCL activity and GSH production were evaluated in flies with a null mutation in the clock genes cycle and period. The rhythms observed in control flies were not evident in the clock mutants, thus linking glutathione production and utilization to the circadian system. Together, these data suggest that the circadian system modulates pathways involved in production and utilization of glutathione.",2012,"Svetlana N Radyuk, Marisa Williamson, Joanna Kotwica-Rolinska, Vladimir I Klichko, Laura M Beaver, William C Orr, Eileen S Chow, Jadwiga M Giebultowicz"

Whole Genome Sequencing and a New Bioinformatics Platform Allow for Rapid Gene Identification in D. melanogaster EMS Screens,24832518,10.3390/biology1030766,"Forward genetic screens in Drosophila melanogaster using ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) mutagenesis are a powerful approach for identifying genes that modulate specific biological processes in an in vivo setting. The mapping of genes that contain randomly-induced point mutations has become more efficient in Drosophila thanks to the maturation and availability of many types of genetic tools. However, classic approaches to gene mapping are relatively slow and ultimately require extensive Sanger sequencing of candidate chromosomal loci. With the advent of new high-throughput sequencing techniques, it is increasingly efficient to directly re-sequence the whole genome of model organisms. This approach, in combination with traditional chromosomal mapping, has the potential to greatly simplify and accelerate mutation identification in mutants generated in EMS screens. Here we show that next-generation sequencing (NGS) is an accurate and efficient tool for high-throughput sequencing and mutation discovery in Drosophila melanogaster. As a test case, mutant strains of Drosophila that exhibited long-term survival of severed peripheral axons were identified in a forward EMS mutagenesis. All mutants were recessive and fell into a single lethal complementation group, which suggested that a single gene was responsible for the protective axon degenerative phenotype. Whole genome sequencing of these genomes identified the underlying gene ect4. To improve the process of genome wide mutation identification, we developed Genomes Management Application (GEM.app, https://genomics.med.miami.edu), a graphical online user interface to a custom query framework. Using a custom GEM.app query, we were able to identify that each mutant carried a unique non-sense mutation in the gene ect4 (dSarm), which was recently shown by Osterloh et al. to be essential for the activation of axonal degeneration. Our results demonstrate the current advantages and limitations of NGS in Drosophila and we introduce GEM.app as a simple yet powerful genomics analysis tool for the Drosophila community. At a current cost of <$1,000 per genome, NGS should thus become a standard gene discovery tool in EMS induced genetic forward screens.",2012,"Derek Van Booven, Rick H Ulloa, Rafael F Acosta Lebrigio, Stephan Zuchner, Marc Freeman, Mary Logan, Michael A Gonzalez, William Hulme, Jeannette Osterloh"
Cis-by-Trans regulatory divergence causes the asymmetric lethal effects of an ancestral hybrid incompatibility gene,22457639,10.1371/journal.pgen.1002597,"The Dobzhansky and Muller (D-M) model explains the evolution of hybrid incompatibility (HI) through the interaction between lineage-specific derived alleles at two or more loci. In agreement with the expectation that HI results from functional divergence, many protein-coding genes that contribute to incompatibilities between species show signatures of adaptive evolution, including Lhr, which encodes a heterochromatin protein whose amino acid sequence has diverged extensively between Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans by natural selection. The lethality of D. melanogaster/D. simulans F1 hybrid sons is rescued by removing D. simulans Lhr, but not D. melanogaster Lhr, suggesting that the lethal effect results from adaptive evolution in the D. simulans lineage. It has been proposed that adaptive protein divergence in Lhr reflects antagonistic coevolution with species-specific heterochromatin sequences and that defects in LHR protein localization cause hybrid lethality. Here we present surprising results that are inconsistent with this coding-sequence-based model. Using Lhr transgenes expressed under native conditions, we find no evidence that LHR localization differs between D. melanogaster and D. simulans, nor do we find evidence that it mislocalizes in their interspecific hybrids. Rather, we demonstrate that Lhr orthologs are differentially expressed in the hybrid background, with the levels of D. simulans Lhr double that of D. melanogaster Lhr. We further show that this asymmetric expression is caused by cis-by-trans regulatory divergence of Lhr. Therefore, the non-equivalent hybrid lethal effects of Lhr orthologs can be explained by asymmetric expression of a molecular function that is shared by both orthologs and thus was presumably inherited from the ancestral allele of Lhr. We present a model whereby hybrid lethality occurs by the interaction between evolutionarily ancestral and derived alleles.",2012,"Shamoni Maheshwari, Daniel A Barbash"
Molecular cloning of a xylosyltransferase that transfers the second xylose to O-glucosylated epidermal growth factor repeats of notch,22117070,10.1074/jbc.M111.302406,"The extracellular domain of Notch contains epidermal growth factor (EGF) repeats that are extensively modified with different O-linked glycans. O-Fucosylation is essential for receptor function, and elongation with N-acetylglucosamine, catalyzed by members of the Fringe family, modulates Notch activity. Only recently, genes encoding enzymes involved in the O-glucosylation pathway have been cloned. In the Drosophila mutant rumi, characterized by a mutation in the protein O-glucosyltransferase, Notch signaling is impaired in a temperature-dependent manner, and a mouse knock-out leads to embryonic lethality. We have previously identified two human genes, GXYLT1 and GXYLT2, encoding glucoside xylosyltransferases responsible for the transfer of xylose to O-linked glucose. The identity of the enzyme further elongating the glycan to generate the final trisaccharide xylose-xylose-glucose, however, remained unknown. Here, we describe that the human gene C3ORF21 encodes a UDP-xylose:α-xyloside α1,3-xylosyltransferase, acting on xylose-α1,3-glucoseβ1-containing acceptor structures. We have, therefore, renamed it XXYLT1 (xyloside xylosyltransferase 1). XXYLT1 cannot act on a synthetic acceptor containing an α-linked xylose alone, but requires the presence of the underlying glucose. Activity on Notch EGF repeats was proven by in vitro xylosylation of a mouse Notch1 fragment recombinantly produced in Sf9 insect cells, a bacterially expressed EGF repeat from mouse Notch2 modified in vitro by Rumi and Gxylt2 and in vivo by co-expression of the enzyme with the Notch1 fragment.

Specific versus non-specific immune responses in an invertebrate species evidenced by a comparative de novo sequencing study,22427848,10.1371/journal.pone.0032512,"Our present understanding of the functioning and evolutionary history of invertebrate innate immunity derives mostly from studies on a few model species belonging to ecdysozoa. In particular, the characterization of signaling pathways dedicated to specific responses towards fungi and Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria in Drosophila melanogaster challenged our original view of a non-specific immunity in invertebrates. However, much remains to be elucidated from lophotrochozoan species. To investigate the global specificity of the immune response in the fresh-water snail Biomphalaria glabrata, we used massive Illumina sequencing of 5'-end cDNAs to compare expression profiles after challenge by Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria or after a yeast challenge. 5'-end cDNA sequencing of the libraries yielded over 12 millions high quality reads. To link these short reads to expressed genes, we prepared a reference transcriptomic database through automatic assembly and annotation of the 758,510 redundant sequences (ESTs, mRNAs) of B. glabrata available in public databases. Computational analysis of Illumina reads followed by multivariate analyses allowed identification of 1685 candidate transcripts differentially expressed after an immune challenge, with a two fold ratio between transcripts showing a challenge-specific expression versus a lower or non-specific differential expression. Differential expression has been validated using quantitative PCR for a subset of randomly selected candidates. Predicted functions of annotated candidates (approx. 700 unisequences) belonged to a large extend to similar functional categories or protein types. This work significantly expands upon previous gene discovery and expression studies on B. glabrata and suggests that responses to various pathogens may involve similar immune processes or signaling pathways but different genes belonging to multigenic families.

Sex-biased transcriptome evolution in Drosophila,23097318,10.1093/gbe/evs093,"Sex-biased genes are thought to drive phenotypic differences between males and females. The recent availability of high-throughput gene expression data for many related species has led to a burst of investigations into the genomic and evolutionary properties of sex-biased genes. In Drosophila, a number of studies have found that X chromosomes are deficient in male-biased genes (demasculinized) and enriched for female-biased genes (feminized) and that male-biased genes evolve faster than female-biased genes. However, studies have yielded vastly different conclusions regarding the numbers of sex-biased genes and forces shaping their evolution. Here, we use RNA-seq data from multiple tissues of Drosophila melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura, a species with a recently evolved X chromosome, to explore the evolution of sex-biased genes in Drosophila. First, we compare several independent metrics for classifying sex-biased genes and find that the overlap of genes identified by different metrics is small, particularly for female-biased genes. Second, we investigate genome-wide expression patterns and uncover evidence of demasculinization and feminization of both ancestral and new X chromosomes, demonstrating that gene content on sex chromosomes evolves rapidly. Third, we examine the evolutionary rates of sex-biased genes and show that male-biased genes evolve much faster than female-biased genes, which evolve at similar rates to unbiased genes. Analysis of gene expression among tissues reveals that this trend may be partially due to pleiotropic effects of female-biased genes, which limits their evolutionary potential. Thus, our findings illustrate the importance of accurately identifying sex-biased genes and provide insight into their evolutionary dynamics in Drosophila.",2012,"Doris Bachtrog, Qi Zhou, Raquel Assis"
Cloning of rat thymic stromal lymphopoietin receptor (TSLPR) and characterization of genomic structure of murine Tslpr gene,11891057,10.1016/s0378-1119(02)00380-3,"Thymic stromal derived lymphopoietin receptor (TSLPR) is a novel receptor subunit that is related in sequence to the interleukin (IL)-2 receptor common gamma chain.

We have cloned the TSLP receptor from rat and find that the WSXWX motif commonly found in extracellular domains of cytokine receptors is conserved as a W(T/S)XV(T/A) motif among TSLP receptors from mouse, rat and human. As in the mouse, TSLP receptor is widely expressed in rats suggesting that TSLPR may have roles in signaling outside the hematopoietic system. A zooblot analysis revealed that TSLPR is expressed in all vertebrate species examined. The absence of TSLPR in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans genomes is similar to the expression of several other cytokine receptors that have been characterized thus far. We have also characterized the genomic structure of the murine Tslpr gene which shows that in addition to primary sequence homology, it shares a common genomic organization of coding exons with the murine IL-2 receptor common gamma chain (Il2rg).

Substances produced by the mature male gonad, and carried in the spermatophore, induce physiological changes in the female that lead to engorgement and oviposition. To begin defining the molecular phenotype at this stage of male development, we differentially cross-screened a cDNA library made from the testis and vas deferens of fed ticks (Amblyomma hebraeum Koch) and isolated 35 genes that were putatively up-regulated in tissues of fed compared to unfed animals. While the majority of these were novel, two clones, AhT/VD16 and AhT/VD146, yielded homologies (53 and 44%) to known genes (acylphosphatse and 9.0 kD Drosophila melanogaster basic protein, respectively). Results of Northern blot analysis of AhT/VD16 and AhT/VD146 demonstrate that both clones hybridized with mRNA transcripts that were up-regulated in the testis/vas deferens of fed compared to unfed males. In addition, hybridization of clone AhT/VD16 to water strider (Gerris argentatus) genomic DNA, and sequence similarities to mammalian acylphosphatase, suggest that it represents an evolutionarily conserved sequence.",2002,"W Reuben Kaufman, Jadwiga M Stepczynski, Paul Wong, Brian L Weiss"
Regulation of epithelial cell shape and polarity by cell-cell adhesion (Review),12126229,10.1080/09687680210137219,"Among all cell types that exhibit a polarized phenotype, epithelial cells are unique in that their polarity depends on the integration of the cell into a tissue, the epithelium. In recent years, the analysis of epithelial cell polarity in different epithelia and organisms has contributed to an understanding of the components involved and has further demonstrated that cell polarity and cell adhesion are intimately related to each other. Therefore, processes that mediate and modulate cell adhesion and coordinate adhesion and cell shape are fundamental for the function of epithelia. Recent results obtained in Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans have provided further insight into the complex circuits regulating these processes, and have laid the direction for future analysis.",2002,Elisabeth Knust
Cloning and characterization of the human heparanase-1 (HPR1) gene promoter: role of GA-binding protein and Sp1 in regulating HPR1 basal promoter activity,11779847,10.1074/jbc.M105682200,"Heparanase-1 (HPR1) is an endoglycosidase that specifically degrades the heparan sulfate chains of proteoglycan, a component of blood vessel walls and the extracellular matrix. Recent studies demonstrated that HPR1 expression is increased in a variety of malignancies and may play a critical role in tumor metastases. The HPR1 gene and its genomic structure have been recently cloned and characterized. To understand the mechanisms of HPR1 gene expression and regulation, we first mapped the transcription start site of the HPR1 gene and found that HPR1 mRNA was transcribed from the nucleotide position 101 bp upstream of the ATG codon. A 3.5-kb promoter region of the HPR1 gene was cloned. Sequence analysis revealed that the TATA-less, GC-rich promoter of the HPR1 gene belongs to the family of housekeeping genes. This 3.5-kb promoter region exhibited strong promoter activity in two thyroid tumor cell lines. Truncation analysis of the HPR1 promoter identified a minimal 0.3-kb region that had strong basal promoter activity. Truncation and mutational analysis of the HPR1 promoter revealed three Sp1 sites and four Ets-relevant elements (ERE) significantly contributing to basal HPR1 promoter activity. Binding to the Sp1 sites by Sp1 and to the ERE sites by GA-binding protein (GABP) was confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and competition and supershift electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Cotransfection of Sp- and GABP-deficient Drosophila SL-2 cells with the HPR1 promoter-driven luciferase construct plus the expression vector encoding the Sp1, Sp3, or GABP gene induced luciferase gene expression. Mutation or truncation of the Sp1 or ERE sites reduced luciferase expression in both SL-2 cells and thyroid tumor cell lines. Coexpression of GABPalpha/beta and Sp1 or Sp3 further increased luciferase reporter gene expression. Our results collectively suggest that Sp1 cooperates with GABP to regulate HPR1 promoter activity.",2002,"Jeffrey L Platt, Aseem Kumar, Joseph E Parrillo, Richard A Prinz, Laurie A Dempsey, Xiulong Xu, Ping Jiang"
Forked end: a novel transmembrane protein involved in neuromuscular specificity in drosophila identified by gain-of-function screening,11984842,10.1002/neu.10063,"The Drosophila neuromuscular connectivity provides an excellent model system for studies on target recognition and selective synapse formation. To identify molecules involved in neuromuscular recognition, we conducted gain-of-function screening for genes whose forced expression in all muscles alters the target specificity. We report here the identification of a novel transmembrane protein, Forked end (FEND), encoded by the fend gene, by the said screening. When the FEND expression was induced in all muscles, motoneurons that normally innervate muscle 12 formed ectopic synapses on a neighboring muscle 13. The target specificity of these motoneurons was also altered in the loss-of-function mutant of fend. During embryonic development, fend mRNA was detected in a subset of cells in the central nervous system and in the periphery.

A single Hox3 gene with composite bicoid and zerknullt expression characteristics in non-Cyclorrhaphan flies,11773616,10.1073/pnas.012292899,"The members of the evolutionarily conserved Hox-gene complex, termed Hox genes, are required for specifying segmental identity during embryogenesis in various animal phyla. The Hox3 genes of winged insects have lost this ancestral function and are required for the development of extraembryonic epithelia, which do not contribute to any larval structure. Higher flies (Cyclorrhapha) such as Drosophila melanogaster contain Hox3 genes of two types, the zerknüllt type and the bicoid type. The zerknüllt gene is expressed zygotically on the dorsal side of the embryo and is required for establishing extraembryonic tissue. Its sister gene bicoid is expressed maternally and the transcripts are localized at the anterior pole of the mature egg. BICOID protein, which emerges from this localized source during early development, is required for embryonic patterning. All known direct bicoid homologues are confined to Cyclorrhaphan flies. Here, we describe Hox3 genes of the non-Cyclorrhaphan flies Empis livida (Empididae), Haematopota pluvialis (Tabanidae), and Clogmia albipunctata (Psychodidae). The gene sequences are more similar to zerknüllt homologues than to bicoid homologues, but they share expression characteristics of both genes. We propose that an ancestral Hox3 gene had been duplicated in the stem lineage of Cyclorrhaphan flies. During evolution, one of the gene copies lost maternal expression and evolved as zerknüllt, whereas the second copy lost zygotic expression and evolved as bicoid. Our finding correlates well with a partial reduction of zerknüllt-dependent extraembryonic tissue during Dipteran evolution.",2002,"Urs Schmidt-Ott, Alexander Prell, Michael Stauber"
Mutation of the Drosophila homologue of the Myb protooncogene causes genomic instability,12032301,10.1073/pnas.122231599,"Vertebrates have three related Myb genes. The c-Myb protooncogene is required for definitive hematopoiesis in mice and when mutated causes leukemias and lymphomas in birds and mammals. The A-Myb gene is required for spermatogenesis and mammary gland proliferation in mice. The ubiquitously expressed B-Myb gene is essential for early embryonic development in mice and is directly regulated by the p16/cyclin D/Rb family/E2F pathway along with many critical S-phase genes. Drosophila has a single Myb gene most closely related to B-Myb. We have isolated two late-larval lethal alleles of Drosophila Myb. Mutant imaginal discs show an increased number of cells arrested in M phase. Mutant mitotic cells display a variety of abnormalities including spindle defects and increased polyploidy and aneuploidy. Remarkably, some mutant cells have an aberrant S- to M-phase transition in which replicating chromosomes undergo premature histone phosphorylation and chromosomal condensation. These results suggest that the absence of Drosophila Myb causes a defect in S phase that may result in M-phase abnormalities. Consistent with a role for Drosophila Myb during S phase, we detected Dm-Myb protein in S-phase nuclei of wild-type mitotic cells as well as endocycling cells, which lack both an M phase and cyclin B expression. Moreover, we found that the Dm-Myb protein is concentrated in regions of S-phase nuclei that are actively undergoing DNA replication. Together these findings imply that Dm-Myb provides an essential nontranscriptional function during chromosomal replication.",2002,"Joseph S Lipsick, Nesanet Mitiku, J Robert Manak"
Regulation of cell number by MAPK-dependent control of apoptosis: a mechanism for trophic survival signaling,11832242,10.1016/s1534-5807(02)00116-8,"Trophic mechanisms in which neighboring cells mutually control their survival by secreting extracellular factors play an important role in determining cell number. However, how trophic signaling suppresses cell death is still poorly understood. We now show that the survival of a subset of midline glia cells in Drosophila depends upon direct suppression of the proapoptotic protein HID via the EGF receptor/RAS/MAPK pathway. The TGFalpha-like ligand SPITZ is activated in the neurons, and glial cells compete for limited amounts of secreted SPITZ to survive. In midline glia that fail to activate the EGFR pathway, HID induces apoptosis by blocking a caspase inhibitor, Diap1. Therefore, a direct pathway linking a specific extracellular survival factor with a caspase-based death program has been established.",2002,"Hermann Steller, Andreas Bergmann, Michael Tugentman, Ben Zion Shilo"

We have previously identified the first insect AKH receptors from the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster and the silkworm Bombyx mori (Staubli et al., PNAS 2002, 99: 3446-3451). Here, we have cloned the cDNA of a Drosophila G protein-coupled receptor that was closely related to the first Drosophila AKH receptor both with respect to amino-acid sequence and gene structure. We have subsequently expressed this orphan receptor in Chinese hamster ovary cells and identified Drosophila corazonin as the endogenous ligand for the receptor. Corazonin increases heart beat in some insects, but its function in Drosophila is unknown. These results are intriguing, because not only are the Drosophila AKH and corazonin receptors structurally and evolutionarily related, but also are their preprohormones, which suggests a co-evolution of ligands and receptors. The Drosophila corazonin receptor is expressed in embryos, larvae, pupae, and adult flies. Furthermore, a receptor that is structurally very similar to the Drosophila corazonin receptor can be found in the genomic database from the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae.",2002,"Giuseppe Cazzamali, Cornelis Grimmelikhuijzen, Nicolaj Saxild"
Drosophila p27Dacapo expression during embryogenesis is controlled by a complex regulatory region independent of cell cycle progression,11807025,,"dacapo encodes a CIP/KIP-type inhibitor of Cyclin E/Cdk2 complexes in Drosophila melanogaster. In the embryonic epidermis, dacapo expression starts during G2 of the final division cycle and is required for the arrest of cell cycle progression in G1 after the final mitosis. The onset of dacapo transcription is the earliest event known to be required for the epidermal cell proliferation arrest. To advance our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms that terminate cell proliferation at the appropriate stage, we have analyzed the control of dacapo transcription. We show that dacapo transcription is not coupled to cell cycle progression. It is not affected in mutants where proliferation is arrested either too early or too late. Moreover, upregulation of dacapo expression is not an obligatory event of the cell cycle exit process. During early development of the central nervous system, we cannot detect p27Dacapo during the final division cycle of ganglion mother cells, while it is expressed at later stages. The control of dacapo expression therefore varies in different stages and tissues. The dacapo regulatory region includes many independent cis-regulatory elements. The elements that control epidermal expression integrate developmental cues that time the arrest of cell proliferation.",2002,"Sandra Marzodko, Ina Kramer, Rainer Dittrich, Claas A Meyer, Christian F Lehner, Jan Emmerich"
Functional coupling of acoustic and chemical signals in the courtship behaviour of the male Drosophila melanogaster,11934360,10.1098/rspb.2001.1919,"During courtship, the male Drosophila melanogaster sends signals to the female through two major sensory channels: chemical and acoustic. These signals are involved in the stimulation of the female to accept copulation. In order to determine the respective importance in the courtship of these signals, their production was controlled using genetical and surgical techniques. Males deprived of the ability to emit both signals are unable to mate, demonstrating that other (e.g. visual or tactile) signals are not sufficient to stimulate the female. If either acoustic or chemical signals are lacking, the courtship success is strongly reduced, the lack of the former having significantly more drastic effects. However, the accelerated matings of males observed with males bearing wild-type hydrocarbons compared with defective ones, whichever the modality of acoustic performance (wing vibration or playback), strongly support the role of cuticular compounds to stimulate females. We can conclude that among the possible factors involved in communication during courtship, acoustic and chemical signals may act in a synergistic way and not separately in D. melanogaster.",2002,"T Aubin, G Sureau, F Rybak"
ARGONAUTE1 is required for efficient RNA interference in Drosophila embryos,12011447,10.1073/pnas.072190799,"Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) triggers homology-dependent posttranscriptional gene interference (RNAi) in a diverse range of eukaryotic organisms, in a process mechanistically related to viral and transgene-mediated cosuppression. RNAi is characterized by the conversion of long dsRNA into approximately 21-25-nt small interfering RNAs (siRNA) that guide the degradation of homologous mRNA. Many of the genes required for siRNA production and target mRNA degradation are widely conserved. Notably, members of the Argonaute-like gene family from Arabidopsis, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila, and Neurospora have been genetically and/or biochemically identified as components of the RNAi/cosuppression pathway. We show here that mutations in the Drosophila Argonaute1 (AGO1) gene suppress RNAi in embryos. This defect corresponds to a reduced ability to degrade mRNA in response to dsRNA in vitro. Furthermore, AGO1 is not required for siRNA production in vitro nor can the introduction of siRNA bypass AGO1 mutants in vivo. These data suggest that AGO1 functions downstream of siRNA production.",2002,"Robert W Williams, Gerald M Rubin"
Cocaine sensitization and reward are under the influence of circadian genes and rhythm,12084940,10.1073/pnas.142039099,"Investigations using the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster have shown that the circadian clock gene period (Per) can influence behavioral responses to cocaine. Here we show that the mouse homologues of the Drosophila Per gene, mPer1 and mPer2, modulate cocaine sensitization and reward, two phenomena extensively studied in humans and animals because of their importance for drug abuse. In response to an acute cocaine injection mPer1 and mPer2 mutant mice as well as wild-type mice exhibited an approximately 5-fold increase in activity compared with saline control levels, showing that there is no initial difference in sensitivity to acute cocaine administration in Per mutants. After repeated cocaine injections wild-type mice exhibited a sensitized behavioral response that was absent in mPer1 knockout mice. In contrast, mPer2 mutant mice exhibited a hypersensitized response to cocaine. Conditioned place preference experiments revealed similar behavioral reactions: mPer1 knockout mice showed a complete lack of cocaine reward whereas mPer2 mutants showed a strong cocaine-induced place preference. In another set of experiments, we tested C57/BL6J mice at different Zeitgeber times and found that cocaine-induced behavioral sensitization and place preference are under the control of the circadian clock. In conclusion, we demonstrate that processes involved in cocaine addiction depend on the circadian rhythm and are modulated in an opposing manner by mPer1 and mPer2 genes.",2002,"Carolina Abarca, Rainer Spanagel, Urs Albrecht"

Effectors of this pathway include Chico (the insulin receptor substrate homologue), dPI(3)K, dPKB, dPTEN, and dS6K. Mutations in any of these components have a striking effect on cell size and number, with the exception of dS6K. Mutants in dS6K affect cell size but not cell number, seemingly consistent with arguments that dS6K is a distal effector in the signalling pathway, directly controlled by dTOR, a downstream effector of dPI(3)K and dPKB. Unexpectedly, recent studies showed that dS6K activity is unimpaired in chico-deficient larvae, suggesting that dS6K activation may be mediated through the dPI(3)K docking sites of the Drosophila insulin receptor. Here, we show genetically, pharmacologically and biochemically that dS6K resides on an insulin signalling pathway distinct from that of dPKB, and surprisingly also from that of dPI(3)K. More striking, despite dPKB-dPI(3)K-independence, dS6K activity is dependent on the Drosophila homologue of the phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1, dPDK1, demonstrating that both dPDK1, as well as dTOR, mediated dS6K activation is phosphatidylinositide-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3)-independent.",2002,"C Peter Downes, George Thomas, Jeroen van der Kaay, Ernst Hafen, Thomas Radimerski, Hugo Stocker, Jacques Montagne, Felix Rintelen"

Mice containing null mutations in Dvl2 present with 50% lethality in both inbred 129S6 and in a hybrid 129S6-NIH Black Swiss background because of severe cardiovascular outflow tract defects, including double outlet right ventricle, transposition of the great arteries and persistent truncus arteriosis. The majority of the surviving Dvl2(-/-) mice were female, suggesting that penetrance was influenced by sex.

In addition, approximately 90% of Dvl2(-/-) mice have vertebral and rib malformations that affect the proximal as well as the distal parts of the ribs. These skeletal abnormalities were more pronounced in mice deficient for both Dvl1 and Dvl2. Somite differentiation markers used to analyze Dvl2(-/-) and Dvl1(-/-);Dvl2(-/-) mutant embryos revealed mildly aberrant expression of Uncx4.1, delta 1 and myogenin, suggesting defects in somite segmentation.

They are indicative of the main allocation of postmitotic cells of the growing clones. Growth is exponential and intercalar, i.e., the progeny of ancestor cells becomes more and more separated. Clones are compact, indicating that daughter cells tend to remain side by side. The shape of the clones is wing region characteristic. Subpopulations of cells grow preferentially along veins and wing margins and show characteristic shapes in different pleural regions.

Molecular biology of mosquito vitellogenesis: from basic studies to genetic engineering of antipathogen immunity,12225918,10.1016/s0965-1748(02)00090-5,"Elucidation of molecular mechanisms underlying stage- and tissue-specific expression of genes activated by a blood meal is of great importance for current efforts directed towards utilizing molecular genetics to develop novel strategies of mosquito and pathogen control. Regulatory regions of such genes can be used to express anti-pathogen effector molecules in engineered vectors in a precise temporal and spatial manner, designed to maximally affect a pathogen. The fat body is a particularly important target for engineering anti-pathogen properties because in insects, it is a potent secretory tissue releasing its products to the hemolymph, an environment or a crossroad for most pathogens. Recently, we have provided proof of this concept by engineering stable transformant lines of Aedes aegypti mosquito, in which the regulatory region A. aegypti vitellogenin (Vg) gene activates high-level fat body-specific expression of a potent anti-bacterial factor, defensin, in response to a blood meal. Further study of the Vg gene utilizing Drosophila and Aedes transformation identified cis-regulatory sites responsible for state- and fat body-specific activation of this gene via a blood-meal-triggered cascade. These analyses revealed three regulatory regions in the 2.1-kb upstream portion of the Vg gene. The proximal region, containing binding sites to EcR/USP, GATA, C/EBP and HNF3/fkh, is required for the correct tissue- and stage-specific expression at a low level. The median region, carrying sites for early ecdysone response factors E74 and E75, is responsible for a stage-specific hormonal enhancement of the Vg expression. Finally, the distal GATA-rich region is necessary for extremely high expression levels characteristic to the Vg gene. Furthermore, our study showed that several transcription factors involved in controlling the Vg gene expression, are themselves targets of the blood meal-mediated regulatory cascade, thus greatly amplifying the effect of this cascade on the Vg gene.

Harm to females increases with male body size in Drosophila melanogaster,12350270,10.1098/rspb.2002.2090,"Previous studies indicate that female Drosophila melanogaster are harmed by their mates through copulation. Here, we demonstrate that the harm that males inflict upon females increases with male size. Specifically, both the lifespan and egg-production rate of females decreased significantly as an increasing function of the body size of their mates. Consequently, females mating with larger males had lower lifetime fitness. The detrimental effect of male size on female longevity was not mediated by male effects on female fecundity, egg-production rate or female-remating behaviour. Similarly, the influence of male size on female lifetime fecundity was independent of the male-size effect on female longevity. There was no relationship between female size and female resistance to male harm. Thus, although increasing male body size is known to enhance male mating success, it has a detrimental effect on the direct fitness of their mates. Our results indicate that this harm is a pleiotropic effect of some other selected function and not an adaptation. To the extent that females prefer to mate with larger males, this choice is harmful, a pattern that is consistent with the theory of sexually antagonistic coevolution.",2002,"Scott Pitnick, Francisco García-González"

While in mammals at least three different porin genes have been found, only one VDAC-encoding gene, porin, has been described so far in Drosophila melanogaster. It produces transcripts with alternative untranslated sequences. Here we report the identification of two PlacW insertions in the porin gene among a set of P-element insertions that have been mapped to the 32B3-4 region on the second chromosome. Homozygotes, as well as trans-heterozygotes for these insertions, lack VDAC, and die during the late pupal stage. Function can be restored by precise excision of the P transposon, while most deletions in the porin locus, produced by imprecise excisions, display the recessive lethal effect of the original mutant alleles. However, one of the deletions was found to be a hypomorphic male-sterile allele producing low levels of the VDAC protein, indicating that the product of the porin gene is also essential for male fertility. Analysis of the new mutant alleles also showed that the untranslated exon 1B of the porin gene is not required for VDAC synthesis.

Dmp53 activates the Hippo pathway to promote cell death in response to DNA damage,16860746,10.1016/j.cub.2006.05.059,"Developmental and environmental signals control a precise program of growth, proliferation, and cell death. This program ensures that animals reach, but do not exceed, their typical size . Understanding how cells sense the limits of tissue size and respond accordingly by exiting the cell cycle or undergoing apoptosis has important implications for both developmental and cancer biology. The Hippo (Hpo) pathway comprises the kinases Hpo and Warts/Lats (Wts), the adaptors Salvador (Sav) and Mob1 as a tumor suppressor (Mats), the cytoskeletal proteins Expanded and Merlin, and the transcriptional cofactor Yorkie (Yki) . This pathway has been shown to restrict cell division and promote apoptosis. The caspase repressor DIAP1 appears to be a primary target of the Hpo pathway in cell-death control. Firstly, Hpo promotes DIAP1 phosphorylation, likely decreasing its stability. Secondly, Wts phosphorylates and inactivates Yki, decreasing DIAP1 transcription. Although we understand some of the events downstream of the Hpo kinase, its mode of activation remains mysterious. Here, we show that Hpo can be activated by Ionizing Radiations (IR) in a Dmp53 (Drosophila melanogaster p53)-dependent manner and that Hpo is required (though not absolutely) for the cell death response elicited by IR or Dmp53 ectopic expression.",2006,"Filipe Josué, Nicolas Tapon, Julien Colombani, Cédric Polesello"
Drosophila melanogaster locomotion in cold thin air,16391358,10.1242/jeb.01999,"The alpine environment is likely to challenge insect locomotion because of low mean temperatures and reduced barometric pressure. In this study, we measured the direct and interactive effects of these factors on walking and flight performance of wild-caught Drosophila melanogaster Meigen. We found that decreased temperature and decreased air pressure both reduced walking speed and flight performance. Flies walked more slowly at 18 degrees C and in the lowest air pressure treatment (34 kPa). This treatment, equivalent in air pressure to the top of Mount Everest, was the only air pressure that significantly reduced fly walking speed. Therefore, walking performance in the wild is likely limited by temperature, but not oxygen availability. In contrast to walking performance, low but ecologically realistic air pressures dramatically reduced overall flight performance. The effects of reduced air pressure on flight performance were more pronounced at colder temperatures. Reduced flight performance in high altitude conditions was primarily driven by an increased reluctance for flies to initiate flight rather than outright failure to fly. Such reluctance to fly in high altitude conditions may in part explain the prevalence of aptery and brachyptery in high altitude insects. The observed interactive effects of temperature and air pressure on flight performance confirm the importance of simultaneously manipulating both of these factors when studying the impact of altitudinal conditions on insect physiology and behavior.",2006,"Melanie R Frazier, Michael E Dillon"
Polarised asymmetric inheritance of accumulated protein damage in higher eukaryotes,17147470,10.1371/journal.pbio.0040417,"Disease-associated misfolded proteins or proteins damaged due to cellular stress are generally disposed via the cellular protein quality-control system. However, under saturating conditions, misfolded proteins will aggregate. In higher eukaryotes, these aggregates can be transported to accumulate in aggresomes at the microtubule organizing center. The fate of cells that contain aggresomes is currently unknown. Here we report that cells that have formed aggresomes can undergo normal mitosis. As a result, the aggregated proteins are asymmetrically distributed to one of the daughter cells, leaving the other daughter free of accumulated protein damage. Using both epithelial crypts of the small intestine of patients with a protein folding disease and Drosophila melanogaster neural precursor cells as models, we found that the inheritance of protein aggregates during mitosis occurs with a fixed polarity indicative of a mechanism to preserve the long-lived progeny.",2006,"Ewout R Brunt, María A Rujano, Florian A Salomons, Maria A W H van Waarde, Freark Dijk, Harm H Kampinga, Rob A I de Vos, Johannes J L van der Want, Floris Bosveld, Ody C M Sibon"
The virus infecting the parasitoid Leptopilina boulardi exerts a specific action on superparasitism behaviour,16700960,10.1017/S0031182006009930,"Parasites often induce behavioural changes in their host. However, it is not necessarily easy to determine whether these changes are representative of an adaptation of the parasite (parasite manipulation), an adaptive response of the host or a side-effect of infection. In a solitary parasitoid of Drosophila larvae (Leptopilina boulardi), viral particles (LbFV) modify the host acceptance behaviour of infected females by increasing their tendency to superparasitize. This behavioural alteration allows for the horizontal transmission of the virus within superparasitized Drosophila larvae. To add support for or against the 'manipulation hypothesis', we investigated whether other behavioural components of the parasitoid are affected by viral infection, and whether other forms of horizontal transmission exist. Neither the ability of females to locate host kairomones nor their daily rhythm of locomotor activity was affected by viral infection. However, infected females showed a lower rate of locomotor activity, suggesting a physiological cost of infection. The searching paths of females were also unaffected. Males from infected and uninfected lines showed the same ability to locate females'sexual pheromones. Moreover, alternative modes of horizontal transmission (through food consumption and/or contact with the same Drosophila larvae) did not lead to viral contamination of the parasitoid. The overall specificity of behavioural alteration and of viral horizontal transmission is consistent with the hypothesis that the virus manipulates the behaviour of the parasitoid.",2006,"F Fleury, M Boulétreau, S Petit, J Varaldi"
Olfactory responses in a gustatory organ of the malaria vector mosquito Anopheles gambiae,16938890,10.1073/pnas.0601107103,"The proboscis is an important head appendage in insects that has primarily been thought to process gustatory information during food intake. Indeed, in Drosophila and other insects in which they have been identified, most gustatory receptors are expressed in proboscis neurons. Our previous characterization of the expression of AgOR7, a highly conserved odorant receptor (OR) of the Afrotropical malaria vector mosquito Anopheles gambiae in the labellum at the tip of the proboscis was suggestive of a potential olfactory function in this mosquito appendage. To test this hypothesis, we used electrophysiological recording and neuronal tracing, and carried out a molecular characterization of candidate OR expression in the labellum of A. gambiae. These studies have uncovered a set of labial olfactory responses to a small spectrum of human-related odorants, such as isovaleric acid, butylamine, and several ketones and oxocarboxylic acids. Molecular analyses indicated that at least 24 conventional OR genes are expressed throughout the proboscis. Furthermore, to more fully examine AgOR expression within this tissue, we characterized the AgOR profile within a single labial olfactory sensillum. This study provides compelling data to support the hypothesis that a cryptic set of olfactory neurons that respond to a small set of odorants are present in the mouth parts of hematophagous mosquitoes. This result is consistent with an important role for the labellum in the close-range discrimination of bloodmeal hosts that directly impacts the ability of A. gambiae to transmit malaria and other diseases.",2006,"Laurence J Zwiebel, Tan Lu, Hyung-Wook Kwon, Michael Rützler"
Hsp90 and the quantitative variation of wing shape in Drosophila melanogaster,17263114,,"The molecular chaperone protein Hsp90 has been widely discussed as a candidate gene for developmental buffering. We used the methods of geometric morphometrics to analyze its effects on the variation among individuals and fluctuating asymmetry of wing shape in Drosophila melanogaster. Three different experimental approaches were used to reduce Hsp90 activity. In the first experiment, developing larvae were reared in food containing a specific inhibitor of Hsp90, geldanamycin, but neither individual variation nor fluctuating asymmetry was altered. Two further experiments generated lines of genetically identical flies carrying mutations of Hsp83, the gene encoding the Hsp90 protein, in heterozygous condition in nine different genetic backgrounds. The first of these, introducing entire chromosomes carrying either of two Hsp83 mutations, did not increase shape variation or asymmetry over a wild-type control in any of the nine genetic backgrounds. In contrast, the third experiment, in which one of these Hsp83 alleles was introgressed into the wild-type background that served as the control, induced an increase in both individual variation and fluctuating asymmetry within each of the nine genetic backgrounds. No effect of Hsp90 on the difference among lines was detected, pro,iding no evidence for cryptic genetic variation of wing shape. Overall, these results suggest that Hsp90 contributes to, but is not controlling, the buffering of phenotypic variation in wing shape.",2006,"Suzannah Rutherford, Claire C Milton, Vincent Debat, Ary A Hoffmann, Christian Peter Klingenberg"
The genetics of mental retardation,16987873,10.1093/hmg/ddl189,"Genetic abnormalities frequently give rise to a mental retardation phenotype. Recent advances in resolution of comparative genomic hybridization and genomic sequence annotation has identified new syndromes at chromosome 3q29 and 9q34. The finding of a significant number of copy number polymorphisms in the genome in the normal population, means that assigning pathogenicity to deletions and duplications in patients with mental retardation can be difficult but has been identified for duplications of MECP2 and L1CAM. Novel autosomal genes that cause mental retardation have been identified recently including CC2D1A identified by homozygosity mapping. Several new genes and pathways have been identified in the field of X-linked mental retardation but many more still await identification. Analysis of families where only a single male is affected reveals that the chance of this being due to a single X-linked gene abnormality is significantly less than would be expected if the excess of males in the population is entirely due to X-linked disease. Recent identification of novel X-linked mental retardation genes has identified components of the post-synaptic density and multiple zinc finger transcription factors as disease causing suggesting new mechanisms of disease causation. The first therapeutic treatments of animal models of mental retardation have been reported, a Drosophila model of Fragile X syndrome has been treated with lithium or metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) antagonists and a mouse model of NF1 has been treated with the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor lavastatin, which improves the learning and memory skills in these models.",2006,"Patrick Tarpey, F Lucy Raymond"
Identifying neuropeptide and protein hormone receptors in Drosophila melanogaster by exploiting genomic data,17202123,10.1093/bfgp/eli003,"Most neuropeptide and protein hormone receptors belong to the large superfamily of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs).

About 50 of these receptors were predicted to have neuropeptides or protein hormones as their ligands.

Cytoplasmic activated protein kinase Akt regulates lipid-droplet accumulation in Drosophila nurse cells,17079271,10.1242/dev.02659,"The insulin/insulin-like growth factor signalling (IIS) cascade performs a broad range of evolutionarily conserved functions, including the regulation of growth, developmental timing and lifespan, and the control of sugar, protein and lipid metabolism. Recently, these functions have been genetically dissected in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, revealing a crucial role for cell-surface activation of the downstream effector kinase Akt in many of these processes. However, the mechanisms regulating lipid metabolism and the storage of lipid during development are less well characterized. Here, we use the nutrient-storing nurse cells of the fly ovary to study the cellular effects of intracellular IIS components on lipid accumulation. These cells normally store lipid in a perinuclear pool of small neutral triglyceride-containing droplets. We find that loss of the IIS signalling antagonist PTEN, which stimulates cell growth in most developing tissues, produces a very different phenotype in nurse cells, inducing formation of highly enlarged lipid droplets. Furthermore, we show that the accumulation of activated Akt in the cytoplasm is responsible for this phenotype and leads to a much higher expression of LSD2, the fly homologue of the vertebrate lipid-storage protein perilipin. Our work therefore reveals a signalling mechanism by which the effect of insulin on lipid metabolism could be regulated independently of some of its other functions during development and adulthood. We speculate that this mechanism could be important in explaining the well-established link between obesity and insulin resistance that is observed in Type 2 diabetes.",2006,"Clive Wilson, Natalia Vereshchagina"
Lepidopteran ortholog of Drosophila breathless is a receptor for the baculovirus fibroblast growth factor,16699027,10.1128/JVI.00248-06,"The Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) encodes a gene homologous to the mammalian fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family. We report the cloning of B. mori and Spodoptera frugiperda orthologous genes (Bmbtl and Sfbtl, respectively) of Drosophila melanogaster breathless (btl) encoding a receptor for Branchless/FGF and show that these genes encode the receptor for a baculovirus-encoded FGF (vFGF). Sequence analysis showed that BmBtl is composed of 856 amino acid residues, which potentially encodes a 97.3-kDa polypeptide and shares structural features and sequence similarities with the FGF receptor family. Reverse transcription-PCR experiments showed that Bmbtl was abundantly expressed in the trachea and midgut in B. mori larvae, with moderate expression observed in the hemocytes and the B. mori cultured cell line BmN. We generated Sf-9 cells that stably expressed His-tagged BmBtl. Western blot analysis revealed that BmBtl was an approximately 110-kDa protein. Immunoprecipitation experiments showed that BmNPV vFGF markedly phosphorylated BmBtl in Sf-9 cells. In addition, we found that BmBtl overexpression enhanced the migration activity for BmNPV vFGF. Furthermore, we generated Sf-9 cells in which Sfbtl was knocked down by transfection with double-strand RNA-expressing plasmids. In these cells, cell motility triggered by vFGF was markedly reduced. These results strongly suggest that the Btl orthologs, BmBtl and SfBtl, are the receptors for vFGF, which mediate vFGF-induced host cell chemotaxis.",2006,"Susumu Katsuma, Takaaki Daimon, Kazuei Mita, Toru Shimada"
Rolling blackout is required for synaptic vesicle exocytosis,16510714,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3770-05.2006,"Rolling blackout (RBO) is a putative transmembrane lipase required for phospholipase C-dependent phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate-diacylglycerol signaling in Drosophila neurons. Conditional temperature-sensitive (TS) rbo mutants display complete, reversible paralysis within minutes, demonstrating that RBO is acutely required for movement. RBO protein is localized predominantly in presynaptic boutons at neuromuscular junction (NMJ) synapses and throughout central synaptic neuropil, and rbo TS mutants display a complete, reversible block of both central and peripheral synaptic transmission within minutes. This phenotype appears limited to adults, because larval NMJs do not manifest the acute blockade. Electron microscopy of adult rbo TS mutant boutons reveals an increase in total synaptic vesicle (SV) content, with a concomitant shrinkage of presynaptic bouton size and an accumulation of docked SVs at presynaptic active zones within minutes. Genetic tests reveal a synergistic interaction between rbo and syntaxin1A TS mutants, suggesting that RBO is required in the mechanism of N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE)-mediated SV exocytosis, or in a parallel pathway necessary for SV fusion. The rbo TS mutation does not detectably alter SNARE complex assembly, suggesting a downstream requirement in SV fusion. We conclude that RBO plays an essential role in neurotransmitter release, downstream of SV docking, likely mediating SV fusion.",2006,"Kendal Broadie, Ralf Mohrmann, Elvin Woodruff, Fu-De Huang"
Mutations of a Drosophila NPC1 gene confer sterol and ecdysone metabolic defects,16079224,10.1534/genetics.105.046565,"The molecular mechanisms by which dietary cholesterol is trafficked within cells are poorly understood. Previous work indicates that the NPC1 family of proteins plays an important role in this process, although the precise functions performed by this protein family remain elusive. We have taken a genetic approach to further explore the NPC1 family in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. The Drosophila genome encodes two NPC1 homologs, designated NPC1a and NPC1b, that exhibit 42% and 35% identity to the human NPC1 protein, respectively. Here we describe the results of mutational analysis of the NPC1a gene. The NPC1a gene is ubiquitously expressed, and a null allele of NPC1a confers early larval lethality. The recessive lethal phenotype of NPC1a mutants can be partially rescued on a diet of high cholesterol or one that includes the insect steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone. We also find that expression of NPC1a in the ring gland is sufficient to rescue the lethality associated with the loss of NPC1a and that cholesterol levels in NPC1a mutant larvae are unchanged relative to controls. Our results suggest that NPC1a promotes efficient intracellular trafficking of sterols in many Drosophila tissues including the ring gland where sterols must be delivered to sites of ecdysone synthesis.",2006,"Tracey J Parker, Megan L Fluegel, Leo J Pallanck"
Molecular and bioinformatic analysis of the FB-NOF transposable element,16478650,10.1016/j.gene.2005.11.020,"The Drosophila melanogaster transposable element FB-NOF is known to play a role in genome plasticity through the generation of all sort of genomic rearrangements. Moreover, several insertional mutants due to FB mobilizations have been reported. Its structure and sequence, however, have been poorly studied mainly as a consequence of the long, complex and repetitive sequence of FB inverted repeats. This repetitive region is composed of several 154 bp blocks, each with five almost identical repeats. In this paper, we report the sequencing process of 2 kb long FB inverted repeats of a complete FB-NOF element, with high precision and reliability. This achievement has been possible using a new map of the FB repetitive region, which identifies unambiguously each repeat with new features that can be used as landmarks. With this new vision of the element, a list of FB-NOF in the D. melanogaster genomic clones has been done, improving previous works that used only bioinformatic algorithms. The availability of many FB and FB-NOF sequences allowed an analysis of the FB insertion sequences that showed no sequence specificity, but a preference for A/T rich sequences. The position of NOF into FB is also studied, revealing that it is always located after a second repeat in a random block. With the results of this analysis, we propose a model of transposition in which NOF jumps from FB to FB, using an unidentified transposase enzyme that should specifically recognize the second repeat end of the FB blocks.",2006,"Anna Portela, Noel Xamena, Martí Badal, Oriol Cabré"

Neo-nicotinoid metabolic activation and inactivation established with coupled nicotinic receptor-CYP3A4 and -aldehyde oxidase systems,16153789,10.1016/j.toxlet.2005.08.004,"Two important enzymes in metabolism of the principal neo-nicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid are liver microsomal CYP3 A4 and cytosolic aldehyde oxidase (AOX). CYP3A4 oxidation at several molecular sites and AOX reduction at the nitro substituent result in either an increase (activation) or decrease (inactivation) of agonist potency at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), both insect and vertebrate alpha 4beta 2. This study evaluates activation or inactivation of 11 neo-nicotinoids in a continuous two-step system coupling metabolism and receptor binding. For metabolism, the neo-nicotinoid is incubated with CYP3A4 and NADPH or AOX with the cosubstrate N-methyl-nicotinamide, terminating the reaction with ketoconazole or menadione, respectively, to inhibit further conversion. For receptor assay, either the Drosophila nAChR and [(3)H]imidacloprid or the alpha4 beta2 nicotinic receptor and [(3)H](-)-nicotine are added to determine changes in neo-nicotinoid potency. With the Drosophila nAChR assay, the N-methyl compounds N-methyl-imidacloprid and thiamethoxam are activated 4.5-29-fold by CYP3 A4 whereas nine other neo-nicotinoids are not changed in potency. With the vertebrate alpha4 beta2 nAChR, AOX enhances imidacloprid potency but CYP3 A4 does not. The AOX system coupled with the Drosophila receptor strongly inactivates clothianidin, dinotefuran, imidacloprid, desmethyl-thiamethoxam, and thiamethoxam with some inactivation of nitenpyram and nithiazine, and little or no effect on four other compounds.",2006,"John E Casida, Motohiro Tomizawa, Hideo Honda"

Despite the extensive characterization of the ionic currents at work in cardiac pacemakers, the precise mechanisms initiating spontaneous rhythmic activity and, particularly, those responsible for the specific control of the pacemaker frequency are still matters of debate and have not been entirely elucidated. By using Drosophila as a model animal to analyze automatic cardiac activity, we have investigated the function of a K+ channel, ORK1 (outwardly rectifying K+ channel-1) in cardiac automatic activity. ORK1 is a two-pore domain K+ (K2P) channel, which belongs to a diverse and highly regulated superfamily of potassium-selective leak channels thought to provide baseline regulation of membrane excitability. Cardiac-specific inactivation of Ork1 led to an increase in heart rhythm. By contrast, when overexpressed, ORK1 completely prevented heart beating. In addition, by recording action potentials, we showed that the level of Ork1 activity sets the cardiac rhythm by controlling the duration of the slow diastolic depolarization phase.

We show here that Ubx regulates the activity of the Decapentaplegic (Dpp) signaling pathway at different levels, and that this regulation is instrumental in establishing the size difference. Ubx downregulates dpp transcription and reduces Dpp diffusion by repressing the expression of master of thick veins and division abnormally delayed and by increasing the levels of thick veins, one of the Dpp receptors.

Drosophila Dok is required for embryonic dorsal closure,16339186,10.1242/dev.02198,"Embryonic dorsal closure (DC) in Drosophila is a series of morphogenetic movements involving the bilateral dorsal movement of the epidermis (cell stretching) and dorsal suturing of the leading edge (LE) cells to enclose the viscera. The Syk family tyrosine kinase Shark plays a crucial role in this Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK)-dependent process, where it acts upstream of JNK in LE cells. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, the unique Drosophila homolog of the downstream of kinase (Dok) family, Ddok, was identified by its ability to bind Shark SH2 domains in a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent fashion. In cultured S2 embryonic cells, Ddok tyrosine phosphorylation is Src dependent; Shark associates with Ddok and Ddok localizes at the cell cortex, together with a portion of the Shark protein. The embryonic expression pattern of Ddok resembles the expression pattern of Shark. Ddok loss-of-function mutant (Ddok(PG155)) germ-line clones possess DC defects, including the loss of JNK-dependent expression of dpp mRNA in LE cells, and decreased epidermal F-actin staining and LE actin cable formation. Epistatic analysis indicates that Ddok functions upstream of shark to activate JNK signaling during DC. Consistent with these observations, Ddok mutant embryos exhibit decreased levels of tyrosine phosphorylated Shark at the cell periphery of LE and epidermal cells. As there are six mammalian Dok family members that exhibit some functional redundancy, analysis of the regulation of DC by Ddok is expected to provide novel insights into the function of the Dok adapter proteins.",2006,"E Richard Stanley, Romi Biswas, David Stein"
Planar polarity is positively regulated by casein kinase Iepsilon in Drosophila,16824921,10.1016/j.cub.2006.04.041,"Members of the casein kinase I (CKI) family have been implicated in regulating canonical Wnt/Wingless (Wg) signaling by phosphorylating multiple pathway components. Overexpression of CKI in vertebrate embryos activates Wg signaling, and one target is thought to be the cytoplasmic effector Dishevelled (Dsh), which is an in vitro target of CKI phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of Dsh by CKI has also been suggested to switch its activity from noncanonical to canonical Wingless signaling. However, in vivo loss-of-function experiments have failed to identify a clear role for CKI in positive regulation of Wg signaling. By examining hypomorphic mutations of the Drosophila CKIepsilon homolog discs overgrown (dco)/double-time, we now show that it is an essential component of the noncanonical/planar cell polarity pathway. Genetic interactions indicate that dco acts positively in planar polarity signaling, demonstrating that it does not act as a switch between canonical and noncanonical pathways. Mutations in dco result in a reduced level of Dishevelled phosphorylation in vivo. Furthermore, in these mutants, Dishevelled fails to adopt its characteristic asymmetric subcellular localisation at the distal end of pupal wing cells, and the site of hair outgrowth is disrupted. Finally, we also find that dco function in polarity is partially redundant with CKIalpha.",2006,"David Strutt, Helen Strutt, Mary Ann Price"

Based on our results, we propose a model wherein E4-ORF1 binding to Dlg1 triggers the resulting complex to translocate to the plasma membrane and, at this site, to promote Ras-mediated PI3K activation.

Use of time-lapse imaging and dominant negative receptors to dissect the steroid receptor control of neuronal remodeling in Drosophila,16354717,10.1242/dev.02191,"During metamorphosis, the reorganization of the nervous system of Drosophila melanogaster proceeds in part through remodeling of larval neurons. In this study, we used in-vitro imaging techniques and immunocytochemistry to track the remodeling of the thoracic ventral neurosecretory cells. Axons of these neurons prune their larval arbors early in metamorphosis and a larger, more extensive adult arbor is established via branch outgrowth. Expression of EcR dominant negative constructs and an EcR inverted repeat construct resulted in pruning defects of larval axon arbors and a lack of filopodia during pruning, but showed variable effects on outgrowth depending on the construct expressed. Cells expressing either UAS-EcR-B1(W650A) or UAS-EcR-A(W650A) lacked filopodia during the outgrowth period and formed a poorly branched, larval-like arbor in the adult. Cells expressing UAS-EcR-B1(F645A), UAS-EcR-B2(W650A) or UAS-IR-EcR (core) showed moderate filopodial activity and normal, albeit reduced, adult-like branching during outgrowth.

It is widely believed that exchange of lipids between the plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is required to restore lipid homeostasis during PLC signalling, yet the mechanism remains unresolved. RDGBα (hereafter RDGB) is a multi-domain protein with a PtdIns transfer protein (PITP) domain (RDGB-PITPd). We find that, in vitro, the RDGB-PITPd binds and transfers both PtdOH and PtdIns. In Drosophila photoreceptors, which experience high rates of PLC activity, RDGB function is essential for phototransduction. We show that binding of PtdIns to RDGB-PITPd is essential for normal phototransduction; however, this property is insufficient to explain the in vivo function because another Drosophila PITP (encoded by vib) that also binds PtdIns cannot rescue the phenotypes of RDGB deletion. In RDGB mutants, PtdIns(4,5)P2 resynthesis at the plasma membrane following PLC activation is delayed and PtdOH levels elevate.

To discover small molecule agonists for DrmSPR, a compound library based on a pyrazolodiazepine scaffold, which was previously reported as a potential privileged structure, was screened. Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies of the hit compounds, which exhibited weak agonistic effects (69-72% activation at 100μM), were explored through the synthesis of various analogs with substituents at the R1, R2, R3 and R4 positions of the pyrazolodiazepine skeleton. As a result, compounds 21 and 31 of the 6-benzyl pyrazolodiazepine derivative series were found to be small molecule agonists for DrmSPR with EC50 values of 3-4μM.",2015,"Jae-Hyuk Lee, Joeng-Hyun Kim, Pyeong-Hwa Jeong, Yong-Chul Kim, Ju-Yeon Lee, Young-Joon Kim"
Functional specialization of chordate CDK1 paralogs during oogenic meiosis,25714331,10.1080/15384101.2015.1006000,"Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are central regulators of eukaryotic cell cycle progression. In contrast to interphase CDKs, the mitotic phase CDK1 is the only CDK capable of driving the entire cell cycle and it can do so from yeast to mammals. Interestingly, plants and the marine chordate, Oikopleura dioica, possess paralogs of the highly conserved CDK1 regulator. However, whereas in plants the 2 CDK1 paralogs replace interphase CDK functions, O. dioica has a full complement of interphase CDKs in addition to its 5 odCDK1 paralogs. Here we show specific sub-functionalization of odCDK1 paralogs during oogenesis. Differential spatiotemporal dynamics of the odCDK1a, d and e paralogs and the meiotic polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) and aurora kinase determine the subset of meiotic nuclei in prophase I arrest that will seed growing oocytes and complete meiosis. Whereas we find odCDK1e to be non-essential, knockdown of the odCDK1a paralog resulted in the spawning of non-viable oocytes of reduced size. Knockdown of odCDK1d also resulted in the spawning of non-viable oocytes. In this case, the oocytes were of normal size, but were unable to extrude polar bodies upon exposure to sperm, because they were unable to resume meiosis from prophase I arrest, a classical function of the sole CDK1 during meiosis in other organisms. Thus, we reveal specific sub-functionalization of CDK1 paralogs, during the meiotic oogenic program.",2015,"Coen Campsteijn, Harald Hausen, Ioannis Kourtesis, Jan Inge Øvrebø, Eric M Thompson, Martina Raasholm"
The two SAMP repeats and their phosphorylation state in Drosophila Adenomatous polyposis coli-2 play mechanistically distinct roles in negatively regulating Wnt signaling,26446838,10.1091/mbc.E15-07-0515,"The tumor suppressor Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) plays a key role in regulating the canonical Wnt signaling pathway as an essential component of the β-catenin destruction complex. C-terminal truncations of APC are strongly implicated in both sporadic and familial forms of colorectal cancer. However, many questions remain as to how these mutations interfere with APC's tumor suppressor activity. One set of motifs frequently lost in these cancer-associated truncations is the SAMP repeats that mediate interactions between APC and Axin. APC proteins in both vertebrates and Drosophila contain multiple SAMP repeats that lack high sequence conservation outside of the Axin-binding motif. In this study, we tested the functional redundancy between different SAMPs and how these domains are regulated, using Drosophila APC2 and its two SAMP repeats as our model. Consistent with sequence conservation-based predictions, we show that SAMP2 has stronger binding activity to Axin in vitro, but SAMP1 also plays an essential role in the Wnt destruction complex in vivo. In addition, we demonstrate that the phosphorylation of SAMP repeats is a potential mechanism to regulate their activity. Overall our findings support a model in which each SAMP repeat plays a mechanistically distinct role but they cooperate for maximal destruction complex function.",2015,"Brooke M McCartney, Ryan A Von Kleeck, David M Roberts, Bradford D Greaves, David Vinson, Ezgi Kunttas-Tatli"
Spindle-F Is the Central Mediator of Ik2 Kinase-Dependent Dendrite Pruning in Drosophila Sensory Neurons,26540204,10.1371/journal.pgen.1005642,"During development, certain Drosophila sensory neurons undergo dendrite pruning that selectively eliminates their dendrites but leaves the axons intact. How these neurons regulate pruning activity in the dendrites remains unknown. Here, we identify a coiled-coil protein Spindle-F (Spn-F) that is required for dendrite pruning in Drosophila sensory neurons. Spn-F acts downstream of IKK-related kinase Ik2 in the same pathway for dendrite pruning. Spn-F exhibits a punctate pattern in larval neurons, whereas these Spn-F puncta become redistributed in pupal neurons, a step that is essential for dendrite pruning. The redistribution of Spn-F from puncta in pupal neurons requires the phosphorylation of Spn-F by Ik2 kinase to decrease Spn-F self-association, and depends on the function of microtubule motor dynein complex. Spn-F is a key component to link Ik2 kinase to dynein motor complex, and the formation of Ik2/Spn-F/dynein complex is critical for Spn-F redistribution and for dendrite pruning. Our findings reveal a novel regulatory mechanism for dendrite pruning achieved by temporal activation of Ik2 kinase and dynein-mediated redistribution of Ik2/Spn-F complex in neurons.",2015,"Po-Yuan Pan, Hsueh-Tzu Shih, Yi-Ping Wu, Hsiu-Hsiang Lee, June-Tai Wu, Tzu Lin, Shih-Sian Liao, Hsin-Lun Hsieh, Jian-Ming Ke, Hsu-Chen Cheng, Yu-Ting Lai, Chiou-Yang Tang, Myong-Chol Lee, Shi-Bing Yang, Yuh-Nung Jan, Kai-Wen Chiang"

The evolution of reproductive isolation in the Drosophila yakuba complex of species,25611516,10.1111/jeb.12588,"In the Drosophila melanogaster subgroup, the yakuba species complex, D. yakuba, D. santomea and D. teissieri have identical mitochondrial genomes in spite of nuclear differentiation. The first two species can be readily hybridized in the laboratory and produce fertile females and sterile males. They also form hybrids in natural conditions. Nonetheless, the third species, D. teissieri, was thought to be unable to produce hybrids with either D. yakuba or D. santomea. This in turn posed the conundrum of why the three species shared a single mitochondrial genome. In this report, we show that D. teissieri can indeed hybridize with both D. yakuba and D. santomea. The resulting female hybrids from both crosses are fertile, whereas the hybrid males are sterile. We also characterize six isolating mechanisms that might be involved in keeping the three species apart. Our results open the possibility of studying the history of introgression in the yakuba species complex and dissecting the genetic basis of interspecific differences between these three species by genetic mapping.",2015,"D R Matute, G Liu, D A Turissini, J R David"

H2Aub is essential for viability and required for efficient histone H3 Lys27 trimethylation by PRC2 early in embryogenesis.

Control of neural stem cell self-renewal and differentiation in Drosophila,24902665,10.1007/s00441-014-1914-9,"The neural stem cells of Drosophila, called neuroblasts, have the ability to self-renew and at the same time produce many different types of neurons and glial cells. In the central brain and ventral ganglia, neuroblasts are specified and delaminate from the neuroectoderm during embryonic development under the control of proneural and neurogenic genes. In contrast, in the optic lobes, neuroepithelial cells are transformed into neuroblasts postembryonically by a spatial wave of proneural gene expression. Central brain and ventral nerve cord neuroblasts manifest a short embryonic proliferation period followed by a stage of quiescence and then undergo a prolonged postembryonic proliferation period during which most of the differentiated neurons of the adult CNS are generated. While most neuroblasts belong to a type I class that produces neuronal lineages through non-self-renewing ganglion mother cells, a small subset of type II neuroblasts generates exceptionally large neuronal lineages through self-renewing intermediate progenitor cells that have a transit amplifying function. All neuroblasts in the CNS generate their neural progeny through an asymmetric cell division mode in which the interplay of apical complex and basal complex molecules in the mitotically active progenitor results in the segregation of cell fate determinants into the smaller more differentiated daughter cell. Defects in this molecular control of asymmetric cell division in neuroblasts can result in brain tumor formation. Proliferating neuroblast lineages in the developing CNS utilize transcription factor cascades as a generic mechanism for temporal patterning and birth order-dependent determination of differential neural cell fate. This contributes to the generation of a remarkable diversity of cell types in the developing CNS from a surprisingly small set of neural stem cell-like precursors.",2015,"Heinrich Reichert, Kyung Hwa Kang"
A Stochastic Burst Follows the Periodic Morning Peak in Individual Drosophila Locomotion,26528813,10.1371/journal.pone.0140481,"Coupling between cyclically varying external light and an endogenous biochemical oscillator known as the circadian clock, modulates a rhythmic pattern with two prominent peaks in the locomotion of Drosophila melanogaster. A morning peak appears around the time lights turn on and an evening peak appears just before lights turn off. The close association between the peaks and the external 12:12 hour light/dark photoperiod means that respective morning and evening peaks of individual flies are well-synchronized in time and, consequently, feature prominently in population-averaged data. Here, we report on a brief but strong stochastic burst in fly activity that, in contrast to morning and evening peaks, is detectable only in single fly recordings. This burst was observed across 3 wild-type strains of Drosophila melanogaster. In a single fly recording, the burst is likely to appear once randomly within 0.5-5 hours after lights turn on, last for only 2-3 minutes and yet show 5 times greater activity compared to the maximum of morning peak with data binned in 3 minutes. Owing to its variable timing and short duration, the burst is virtually undetectable in population-averaged data. We use a locally-built illumination system to study the burst and find that its incidence in a population correlates with light intensity, with ~85% of control flies showing the behavior at 8000 lux (1942 μW/cm2). Consistent with that finding, several mutant flies with impaired vision show substantially reduced frequency of the burst. Additionally, we find that genetic ablation of the clock has insignificant effect on burst frequency. Together, these data suggest that the pronounced burst is likely generated by a light-activated circuit that is independent of the circadian clock.",2015,"Paul Levy, Stanislav Lazopulo, Sheyum Syed, Juan A Lopez"
"Functional characterization and expression analysis of the myoinhibiting peptide receptor in the Chagas disease vector, Rhodnius prolixus",25218475,10.1016/j.mce.2014.09.004,"Myoinhibiting peptides (MIPs), which are also known as B-type allatostatins, are a family of neuropeptides found in protostomes. Their primary structure is characterized by an amidated carboxyl-terminal motif consisting of a conserved pair of tryptophan residues normally separated by six non-conserved amino acids (W(X6)Wamide). In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, MIPs are likely the ancestral ligands of the sex peptide receptor, which plays an important role in courtship and reproduction. Recently, several endogenous MIPs were discovered in the Chagas disease vector, Rhodnius prolixus, having both conserved (W(X6)Wamide) and atypical (W(X7)Wamide) carboxyl-terminal motifs. Physiological functions of MIPs are plentiful and include inhibition of visceral muscle activity; a role that has been illustrated on hindgut in R. prolixus. In order to identify novel physiological targets and elucidate biological actions for the MIPs in R. prolixus, we have isolated and examined the spatial expression profile of the MIP receptor transcript in various fifth instar tissues and have additionally determined the expression profile in reproductive tissues of fifth instar as well as adult insects. The most abundant MIP receptor transcript expression was found in the salivary glands and central nervous system, which corroborates roles previously determined for MIPs in other insects. We functionally-characterized the endogenous MIP receptor and examined its activation by R. prolixus MIPs containing the typical W(X6)Wamide and atypical W(X7)Wamide carboxyl-terminal motifs. These peptides dose-dependently activated the MIP receptor (RhoprMIPr1) with EC50 values in the mid-nanomolar range. We also examined the activity of these RhoprMIPs on spontaneous muscle contractions of oviducts from female adult R. prolixus. Our findings confirm the myoinhibitory nature of the MIP peptides, which dose-dependently reduced spontaneous oviduct contractions by nearly 70%, again having mid-nanomolar EC50 values. Finally, we utilized a heterologous receptor assay and oviduct bioassay to examine the activity of several MIP structural analogs, which independently confirmed the requirement of the highly conserved tryptophan residues as well as the amidated C-terminus for retaining full biological activity.",2015,"Ian Orchard, Laura Sedra, Amir Saleem Haddad, Jean-Paul V Paluzzi, Angela B Lange"
Visualizing Molecular Functions and Cross-Species Activity of Sex-Peptide in Drosophila,26022240,10.1534/genetics.115.177550,"The Drosophila melanogaster sex-peptide (melSP) is a seminal fluid component that induces postmating responses (PMR) of females via the sex-peptide receptor (SPR) . Although SP orthologs are found in many Drosophila species, their functions remain poorly characterized. It is unknown whether SP functions are conserved across species or rather specific to each species. Here, we developed a GFP-tagged melSP (G-SP) and used it to visualize cross-species binding activity to the female reproductive system of various species. First we demonstrated that ectopically expressed G-SP induced PMR in D. melanogaster females and bound to the female reproductive system, most notably to the common oviduct. No binding occurred in the females lacking SPR, indicating that G-SP binding was dependent on SPR. Next we tested whether G-SP binds to the common oviducts from 11 Drosophila species using dissected reproductive tracts. The binding was observed in six species belonging to the D. melanogaster species group, but not to those outside the group. Injection of melSP reduced the receptivity of females belonging to the D. melanogaster species group, but not of those outside the group, being consistent with the ability to bind G-SP. Thus the SP-mediated PMR appears to be limited to this species group. SPR was expressed in the oviducts at high levels in this group; therefore, we speculate that an enhanced expression of SPR in the oviduct was critical to establish the SP-mediated PMR during evolution.",2015,"Tsunaki Asano, Jean-Baptiste Peyre, Manabu Tsuda, Toshiro Aigaki"
Intrinsic dorsoventral patterning and extrinsic EGFR signaling genes control glial cell development in the Drosophila nervous system,26318336,10.1016/j.neuroscience.2015.08.049,"Dorsoventral patterning and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling genes are essential for determining neural identity and differentiation of the Drosophila nervous system.

Our study demonstrated that the dorsoventral patterning genes, vnd, ind, and msh, are intrinsically essential for the proper expression of a master glial cell regulator, gcm, and a differentiation gene, repo, in the lateral glia. In addition, we showed that esg is particularly required for their expression in the peripheral glia. These results indicate that the dorsoventral patterning and EGFR signaling genes are essential for identity determination and differentiation of the lateral glia by regulating proper expression of gcm and repo in the lateral glia from the early glial development. In contrast, overexpression of vnd, msh, spi, and Egfr genes repressed the expression of Repo in the ventral neuroectoderm, indicating that maintenance of correct columnar identity along the dorsoventral axis by proper expression of these genes is essential for restrictive formation of glial precursor cells in the lateral neuroectoderm.

Here, we quantified the cytotoxicity and potential genotoxicity of CPF using the alkaline comet assay, γH2AX foci formation, and the DNA laddering assay in order to detect DNA damage and apoptosis in human HeLa and HEK293 cells in vitro. Drosophila S2 cells were used as a positive control. The alkaline comet assay showed that sublethal concentrations of CPF induced significant concentration-dependent increases in single-strand DNA breaks in the treated cells compared with the control. The percentage of γH2AX-positive HeLa cells revealed that CPF also causes DNA double-strand breaks in a time-dependent manner. Moreover, DNA fragmentation analysis demonstrated that exposure to CPF induced a significant concentration- and time-dependent increase in cell apoptosis. We conclude that CPF is a strongly genotoxic agent that induces DNA damage and cell apoptosis.",2015,"Zhichuan Yang, Liming Tao, Diqiu Li, Qingchun Huang, Mimi Zong, Miaoqing Lu, Lei Zhang"

In light of considerable limitations of previous studies proposing that the late chronotypes exhibit weakly stable rhythms, we employed outbred Drosophila populations exhibiting early and late emergence chronotypes to re-visit such associations. Contrary to previous reports, we observed that the late chronotypes consistently exhibit higher stability in emergence and activity-rest rhythms as compared to the early chronotypes, both under laboratory and semi-natural conditions, which is not associated with higher precision of circadian clocks, thus demonstrating the existence of genetic correlations between accuracy of entrainment and chronotype.

There are numerous negative feedback regulators of Wnt signaling, but two stand out as constitutive and obligate Wnt-induced regulators: Axin2 and Nkd1. Whereas Axin2 behaves similarly to Axin in the destruction complex, Nkd1 is more enigmatic. Here we use zebrafish blastula cells that are responsive Wnt signaling to demonstrate that Nkd1 activity is specifically dependent on Wnt ligand activation of the receptor. Furthermore, our results support the hypothesis that Nkd1 is recruited to the Wnt signalosome with Dvl2, where it becomes activated to move into the cytoplasm to interact with β-catenin, inhibiting its nuclear accumulation. Comparison of these results with Nkd function in Drosophila generates a unified and conserved model for the role of this negative feedback regulator in the modulation of Wnt signaling.",2015,"Daniel J Pasula, Roman Kondra, Rasmeet S Dhaliwal, Terence J Van Raay, Jahdiel Larraguibel, Alexander R E Weiss"

Transcriptome analyses of Drosophila S2 cells and adult flies revealed strong induction of the heat shock response upon RNA virus infection. Dynamic induction patterns of heat shock pathway components were characterized in vitro and in vivo following infection with different classes of viruses. The heat shock transcription factor (Hsf), as well as active viral replication, were necessary for the induction of the response. Hsf-deficient adult flies were hypersensitive to virus infection, indicating a role of the heat shock response in antiviral defence. In accordance, transgenic activation of the heat shock response prolonged survival time after infection and enabled long-term control of virus replication to undetectable levels.

Here we show the first molecular structure of an endogenous Drosophila centromere and the ability of the C-rich dodeca satellite strand to form dimeric i-motifs.

A Drosophila model for mito-nuclear diseases generated by an incompatible interaction between tRNA and tRNA synthetase,26035388,10.1242/dmm.019323,"Communication between the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes is vital for cellular function. The assembly of mitochondrial enzyme complexes, which produce the majority of cellular energy, requires the coordinated expression and translation of both mitochondrially and nuclear-encoded proteins. The joint genetic architecture of this system complicates the basis of mitochondrial diseases, and mutations both in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)- and nuclear-encoded genes have been implicated in mitochondrial dysfunction. Previously, in a set of mitochondrial-nuclear introgression strains, we characterized a dual genome epistasis in which a naturally occurring mutation in the Drosophila simulans simw(501) mtDNA-encoded transfer RNA (tRNA) for tyrosine (tRNA(Tyr)) interacts with a mutation in the nuclear-encoded mitochondrially localized tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase from Drosophila melanogaster. Here, we show that the incompatible mitochondrial-nuclear combination results in locomotor defects, reduced mitochondrial respiratory capacity, decreased oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) enzyme activity and severe alterations in mitochondrial morphology. Transgenic rescue strains containing nuclear variants of the tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase are sufficient to rescue many of the deleterious phenotypes identified when paired with the simw(501) mtDNA. However, the severity of this defective mito-nuclear interaction varies across traits and genetic backgrounds, suggesting that the impact of mitochondrial dysfunction might be tissue specific. Because mutations in mitochondrial tRNA(Tyr) are associated with exercise intolerance in humans, this mitochondrial-nuclear introgression model in Drosophila provides a means to dissect the molecular basis of these, and other, mitochondrial diseases that are a consequence of the joint genetic architecture of mitochondrial function.",2015,"Eugenia Villa-Cuesta, Marissa A Holmbeck, David M Rand, Julia R Donner"

Here, we report the design and experimental characterization of a α-helix-mediated homodimer with C2 symmetry based on a monomeric Drosophila engrailed homeodomain scaffold. A solution NMR structure shows that the homodimer exhibits parallel helical packing similar to the design model. Because the mutations leading to dimer formation resulted in poor thermostability of the system, design success was facilitated by the introduction of independent thermostabilizing mutations into the scaffold.

Here, we have investigated the potential roles and underlying mechanisms of Shh signaling in murine placentation. Immunostaining revealed the abundant expression of the main components of Shh pathway in both the trophectoderm of blastocysts and developing placentas. Disruption of Shh led to impaired vascularogenesis of yolk sac, less branching and malformation of placental labyrinth, thereby leading to a robust decrease in capacity of transplacental passages. Moreover, placenta-specific gene incorporation by lentiviral transduction of mouse blastocysts and blastocyst transplantation robustly knocked down the expression of Gli3 and Gli2 in placenta but not in embryos. Finally, Gli3 knockdown in Shh(-/-) placentas partially rescued the defects of both yolk sac and placental labyrinth, and robustly restored the capacity of transplacental passages. Gli2 knockdown in Shh(+/)(-) placentas affected neither the capacity of tranplacental passages nor the vascularogenesis of yolk sac, however, it partially phenocopied the labyrinthine defects of Shh(-/-) placentas.

Metal body burden was significantly lower in females (0.25 µgg(-1) dry weight) than in males (3.03 µgg(-1) dry weight), suggesting that females may have more effective mechanisms controlling the uptake of metal, via the digestive tract, or its elimination from the body.

In midgut gland cells, the level of DNA damage was higher for males than females, while in haemocytes the genotoxic effect of cadmium was greater in females. The obtained results indicate that in spiders cadmium displays strong genotoxic effects and may cause DNA damage even at low concentrations, however the severity of damage seems to be sex- and internal organ-dependent. The comet assay can be considered a sensitive tool for measuring the deleterious effect of cadmium on DNA integrity in spiders.",2015,"Monika Mędrzak, Monika Stalmach, Piotr Wilczek, Magdalena Skowronek, Grażyna Wilczek"
Antennal mechanosensory neurons mediate wing motor reflexes in flying Drosophila,25995481,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0034-15.2015,"Although many behavioral studies have shown the importance of antennal mechanosensation in various aspects of insect flight control, the identities of the mechanosensory neurons responsible for these functions are still unknown. One candidate is the Johnston's organ (JO) neurons that are located in the second antennal segment and detect phasic and tonic rotations of the third antennal segment relative to the second segment. To investigate how different classes of JO neurons respond to different types of antennal movement during flight, we combined 2-photon calcium imaging with a machine vision system to simultaneously record JO neuron activity and the antennal movement from tethered flying fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster). We found that most classes of JO neurons respond strongly to antennal oscillation at the wing beat frequency, but not to the tonic deflections of the antennae. To study how flies use input from the JO neurons during flight, we genetically ablated specific classes of JO neurons and examined their effect on the wing motion. Tethered flies flying in the dark require JO neurons to generate slow antiphasic oscillation of the left and right wing stroke amplitudes. However, JO neurons are not necessary for this antiphasic oscillation when visual feedback is available, indicating that there are multiple pathways for generating antiphasic movement of the wings. Collectively, our results are consistent with a model in which flying flies use JO neurons to detect increases in the wing-induced airflow and that JO neurons are involved in a response that decreases contralateral wing stoke amplitude.",2015,"Michael H Dickinson, Akira Mamiya"
Endocannabinoids are conserved inhibitors of the Hedgehog pathway,25733905,10.1073/pnas.1416463112,"Hedgehog ligands control tissue development and homeostasis by alleviating repression of Smoothened, a seven-pass transmembrane protein. The Hedgehog receptor, Patched, is thought to regulate the availability of small lipophilic Smoothened repressors whose identity is unknown. Lipoproteins contain lipids required to repress Smoothened signaling in vivo. Here, using biochemical fractionation and lipid mass spectrometry, we identify these repressors as endocannabinoids. Endocannabinoids circulate in human and Drosophila lipoproteins and act directly on Smoothened at physiological concentrations to repress signaling in Drosophila and mammalian assays. Phytocannabinoids are also potent Smo inhibitors. These findings link organismal metabolism to local Hedgehog signaling and suggest previously unsuspected mechanisms for the physiological activities of cannabinoids.",2015,"Suzanne Eaton, Andrej Shevchenko, Helena Khaliullina, Julio L Sampaio, Mesut Bilgin"

A Galleria cDNA clone was isolated that encoded a complete DNA-binding domain composed of two zinc fingers and designated GmE75A. Its deduced amino acid sequence showed 100% and 85% identities within the DNA-binding and ligand-binding domains of Drosophila E75A, respectively. The Galleria genomic clone did not encode the N-terminal zinc finger, but included a sequence similar to the B1 exon, which is unique to the B isoform of E75. Thus, the cDNA and genomic DNA sequences indicated that the Galleria gene E75 encoded at least two isoforms, GmE75A and GmE75B, which differed in their N-termini. Probes specific for GmE75A and B hybridized to two distinct transcripts of 2.6 kb. Both GmE75A and B mRNA levels correlated closely with the ecdysteroid titer during development. At the onset of larval/pupal transformation, both transcripts appeared in high amounts within 4 h of the ecdysteroid rise, then declined concurrently with the hormone titer decline. At the time of pupal ecdysis, there was another peak of GmE75A expression but not GmE75B expression, coincident with a minor ecdysteroid pulse. In isolated abdomens of final instar larvae, GmE75A mRNA was induced by 20-hydroxyecdysone within 20 min of the injection; the mRNA levels were maximal at 1 h and declined by 3 h following the treatment.",1994,"F Sehnal, M Jindra, L M Riddiford"
Tight genetic linkage between the kdr insecticide resistance trait and a voltage-sensitive sodium channel gene in the house fly,8146143,10.1073/pnas.91.7.2483,"The kdr insecticide resistance trait in the house fly, Musca domestica, confers resistance to the rapid paralysis (knockdown) and lethal effects of 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDT) and pyrethroids. Flies with the kdr trait exhibit reduced neuronal sensitivity to these compounds, which are known to act at voltage-sensitive sodium channels of nerve membranes. To test the hypothesis that a mutation in a voltage-sensitive sodium channel gene confers the kdr phenotype, we have cloned genomic DNA corresponding to a segment of the house fly homologue of the para sodium channel gene of Drosophila melanogaster, identified restriction-site polymorphisms within this segment between the kdr strain 538ge and an inbred insecticide-susceptible lab stain, and developed a sensitive polymerase chain reaction-based diagnostic procedure to determine the sodium channel genotype of individual flies. A genetic linkage analysis performed with these molecular markers shows that the kdr trait is tightly linked (within about 1 map unit) to the voltage-sensitive sodium channel gene segment exhibiting the DNA sequence polymorphism. These findings provide genetic evidence for a mutation at or near a voltage-sensitive sodium channel gene as the basis for kdr resistance.",1994,"K E Doyle, D M Soderlund, P A Marsella-Herrick, D C Knipple"
Hairy function as a DNA-binding helix-loop-helix repressor of Drosophila sensory organ formation,7958930,10.1101/gad.8.22.2743,"Sensory organ formation in Drosophila is activated by proneural genes that encode basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors. These genes are antagonized by hairy and other proline-bHLH proteins. hairy has not been shown to bind to DNA and has been proposed to form inactive heterodimers with proneural activator proteins. Here, we show that hairy does bind to DNA and has novel DNA-binding activity: hairy prefers a noncanonical site, CACGCG, although it also binds to related sites. Mutation of a single CACGCG site in the achaete (ac) proneural gene blocks hairy-mediated repression of ac transcription in cultured Drosophila cells. Moreover, the same CACGCG mutation in an ac minigene transformed into Drosophila creates ectopic sensory hair organs like those seen in hairy mutants. Together these results indicate that hairy represses sensory organ formation by directly repressing transcription of the ac proneural gene.",1994,"S Ohsako, M Caudy, I Oliver, J Hyer, G Panganiban"
"Suppression of yeast RNA polymerase III mutations by FHL1, a gene coding for a fork head protein involved in rRNA processing",8164651,10.1128/mcb.14.5.2905,"The FHL1 gene was isolated by screening for high-copy-number suppressors of conditional RNA polymerase III mutations. This gene is unique on the yeast genome and was located close to RPC40 and PRE2 on the right arm of chromosome XVI. It codes for a 936-amino-acid protein containing a domain similar to the fork head DNA-binding domain, initially found in the developmental fork head protein of Drosophila melanogaster and in the HNF-3 family of hepatocyte mammalian transcription factors. Null mutations caused a severe reduction in growth rate and a lower rRNA content that resulted from defective rRNA processing. There was no detectable effect on mRNA splicing. Thus, the Fhl1p protein plays a key role in the control of rRNA processing, presumably by acting as a transcriptional regulator of genes specifically involved in that process. Moreover, mutants carrying the RNA polymerase III mutations were slightly defective in rRNA processing. This accounts for the isolation of FHL1 as a dosage-dependent suppressor and suggests that rRNA processing depends on a still-unidentified RNA polymerase III transcript.",1994,"S Hermann-Le Denmat, A Sentenac, M Werner, P Thuriaux"

These results are not in agreement either with the predictions of the antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis proposed by Williams, nor with the opposite hypothesis suggested by Lints.

Cloning and functional expression of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cDNA from Sarcophaga peregrina,8125121,10.1111/j.1432-1033.1994.tb18662.x,"A cDNA spanning the entire coding region for poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) of Sarcophaga peregrina was isolated and the nucleotide sequence was determined. The longest open reading frame encodes a polypeptide of 996 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 113,033 Da. The similarities to the human PARP in amino acid sequence were relatively low in the DNA-binding and auto-modification domains, but very high in the C-terminal catalytic domain: identity of amino acids is 34% in the N-terminal DNA-binding domain (residues 1-369), 27% in the auto-modification domain (residues 370-507), and 56% in the C-terminal NAD-binding domain (residues 508-996). Two zinc-fingers (C-X2-C-X28-H-X2-C and C-X2-C-X31-H-X2-C)2 and a basic region in the N-terminal DNA-binding domain recognized in other PARP are conserved. Downstream of the basic region, another cysteine-rich motif (C-X2-C-X13-C-X9-C), a putative zinc-finger, was found to be well conserved in the PARP of Sarcophaga, Drosophila and human. A leucine-zipper motif (L-X6-L-X6-L-X6-L) which was found in the auto-modification domain of Drosophila PARP, is disrupted in the Sarcophaga enzyme: the second leucine is replaced by proline, and the third leucine by valine. Full-length cDNA for Sarcophaga PARP was cloned into an expression plasmid and expressed in Escherichia coli. A lysate of E. coli cells containing expressed protein reacted with antibody against Sarcophaga PARP, and PARP activity was detected.

Regulation of scute function by extramacrochaete in vitro and in vivo,7821225,,"The pattern of adult sensilla in Drosophila is established by the dosage-sensitive interaction of two antagonistic groups of genes. Sensilla development is promoted by members of the achaete-scute complex and the daughterless gene whereas it is suppressed by whereas extramacrochaete (emc) and hairy. All these genes encode helix-loop-helix proteins. The products of the achaete-scute complex and daughterless interact to form heterodimers able to activate transcription. In this report, we show that (1) extra-macrochaete forms heterodimers with the achaete, scute, lethal of scute and daughterless products; (2) extramacrochaete inhibits DNA-binding of Achaete, Scute and Lethal of Scute/Daughterless heterodimers and Daughterless homodimers and (3) extramacrochaete inhibits transcription activation by heterodimers in a yeast assay system. In addition, we have studied the expression patterns of scute in wild-type and extramacrochaete mutant imaginal discs. Expression of scute RNA during imaginal development occurs in groups of cells, but high levels of protein accumulate in the nuclei of only a subset of the RNA-expressing cells. The pattern is dynamic and results in a small number of protein-containing cells that correspond to sensillum precursors. extramacrochaete loss-of-function alleles develop extra sensilla and correspondingly display a larger number of cells with scute protein. These cells appear to arise from those that in the wild type already express scute RNA; hence, extramacrochaete is a repressor of scute function whose action may take place post-transcriptionally.",1994,"C V Cabrera, H Huikeshoven, M C Alonso"

A region was defined which drives Delta-lacZ RNA expression in clusters of neuroectodermal cells preceding and during SI neuroblast segregation. This pattern is regulated by genes of the AS-C (achaete-scute complex). To identify regulatory regions necessary for normal function of Delta during neural-epidermal lineage segregation, five minigenes consisting of fragments of the 5' genomic DNA fused to a cDNA encoding the entire protein sequence were tested for their ability to rescue the neural hyperplasia caused by a deletion of the Delta locus.

Mammalian homologs of Drosophila ELAV localized to a neuronal subset can bind in vitro to the 3' UTR of mRNA encoding the Id transcriptional repressor,8158249,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.14-04-01943.1994,"Mammalian cDNAs encoding a rat (Rel-N1) and a human (Hel-N1) neuronal RNA-binding protein have been cloned and characterized with respect to tissue specificity, neuroanatomical localization, and RNA binding specificity. Both proteins are highly similar to the product of the Drosophila elav gene, which is expressed in all neurons of the fly and is required for development of the nervous system. However, in situ hybridization of rat tissues demonstrated more restricted expression of Rel-N1 mRNA within a subset of neurons of the hippocampus, cortex, and other regions of the gray matter, but not in glial cells or white matter. In vitro RNA binding experiments demonstrated that Hel-N1 can bind to the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) of Id mRNA, a transcript that encodes a helix-loop-helix transcriptional repressor that is abundantly expressed in undifferentiated neural precursors. Sequences characterized for Hel-N1 binding were also abundantly present in the 3' UTR of the Drosophila extramacrochaetae mRNA, which encodes an Id homolog. Thus, we have identified a potential link between a neuronal 3' UTR RNA-binding protein and regulatory transcription factors involved in neural development.

Large-scale mutagenesis in the zebrafish: in search of genes controlling development in a vertebrate,7922324,10.1016/s0960-9822(00)00048-8,"Background: In Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans, the elucidation of developmental mechanisms has relied primarily on the systematic induction and isolation of mutations in genes with specific functions in development. Such an approach has not yet been possible in a vertebrate species, owing to the difficulty of analyzing and keeping a sufficiently high number of mutagenized lines of animals. Results: We have developed the methods necessary to perform large-scale saturation screens for mutations affecting embryogenesis in the zebrafish, Danio (Brachydanio) rerio. Firstly, a new aquarium system was developed to raise and keep large numbers of strains of genetically different fish safely and with little maintenance care. Secondly, by placing adult male fish in water containing the chemical mutagen, ethylnitrosourea, we induced point mutations in premeiotic germ cells with a rate of one to three mutations per locus per 1,000 mutagenized haploid genomes. This rate, which is similar to the mutagenesis rates produced by ethylmethanesulfonate in Drosophila, was determined for alleles at four different pigmentation genes. Finally, in a pilot screen in which mutagenized fish were inbred for two generations and scored for embryonic mutants, we isolated 100 recessive mutations with phenotypes visible in the homozygous embryos. Conclusion: The high rate of induction and recovery of point mutations, in addition to an efficient aquarium system to house large numbers of mutagenized lines, means that it is now possible to perform saturation mutagenesis screens in a vertebrate, similar to those done in invertebrates.",1994,"M C Mullins, M Hammerschmidt, P Haffter, C Nüsslein-Volhard"

Targeted expression of activated Raf (Rafgof) within follicle cells is sufficient to dorsalize both the eggshell and the embryo, whereas reduced Raf activity ventralizes the eggshell.

The numbers of full length (2.9 kb) P elements per haploid genome of NP280 (P), AK194 (weak P) and WY113 (Q) were at least four, five and one, respectively. However, the 2.9 kb P element of WY113 was thought to be defective since this strain has no transposase activity. In our previous work, we demonstrated that the ORF 3-deleted P element is essential for P cytotype determination in WY113. A similar P element also exists in NP280, and this may have an important role for P cytotype determination in this strain. Two and one copies of the KP element, a deletion derivative of the P element, were found in NP280 and AK194, respectively. One of four complete P elements in NP280 was fully sequenced, and the base sequence was completely identical to that of p pi 25.1 originally derived from the U.S.A.

Our results define the ancient, conserved SWAP protein family whose members share a colinearly arrayed series of novel sequence motifs. Further, we describe evidence that the CeSWAP protein autoregulates its levels by feedback control of splicing of its own pre-mRNA analogously to the DmSWAP protein and as expected of a splicing regulator. The second nematode gene, Ceprp21, encodes an abundant nuclear cognate of the constitutive yeast splicing protein, prp21, on the basis of several lines of evidence. Our analysis defines prp21 as a second novel, ancient protein family. One of the motifs conserved in prp21 proteins--designated surp--is shared with SWAP proteins.

The variance among lines increased significantly for all traits except male mating ability and weight. The rate of increase in variance was similar to that found in previous studies of egg-to-adult viability, when calculated relative to trait means. The mutational correlations among traits were all strongly positive. Many correlations were significantly different from 0, while none was significantly different from 1.

Assembly of recombinant TFIID reveals differential coactivator requirements for distinct transcriptional activators,7923382,10.1016/0092-8674(94)90403-0,"We previously reported that transcriptional regulators can bind selected TAF subunits of the TFIID complex.

A minimal complex containing TBP and TAFII250 directs basal but not activator-responsive transcription. By contrast, reconstituted holo-TFIID supports activation by an assortment of activators. The activator NTF-1, which binds TAFII150, stimulates transcription with a complex containing only TBP, TAFII250, and TAFII150, whereas Sp1 binds and additionally requires TAFII110 for activation.

We searched the genomes of several eukaryotic species for receptors similar to the mammalian trace amine (TA) receptor subfamily. We identified 18 new receptors in rodents that are orthologous to the previously known TA-receptors. Remarkably, we found 57 receptors (and 40 pseudogenes) of this type in the zebrafish (Danio rerio), while fugu (Takifugu rubripes) had only eight receptors (and seven pseudogenes). We mapped 47 of the zebrafish TA-receptors on chromosomes using radiation hybrid panels and meiotic mapping. The results, together with the degree of conservation and phylogenetic relationships displayed among the zebrafish receptors suggest that the family arose through several different mechanisms involving tetraploidization, block duplications, and local duplication events. Interestingly, these vertebrate TA-receptors do not show a close evolutionary relationship to the invertebrate TA-binding receptors in fruitfly (Drosophila melanogaster), indicating that the ability to bind TA have evolved at least twice in animal evolution. We collected in total over 100 vertebrate TA-receptor sequences, and our phylogenetic analysis shows that several TA-receptors have evolved rapidly with remarkable species variation and that the common ancestor of vertebrate TA-receptors arose before the split of the ray-finned and lobe-finned fishes. The evolutionary history of the TA-receptors is more complex than for most other GPCR families and here we suggest a mechanism by which they may have arisen.",2005,"Yi-Lin Yan, John H Postlethwait, Helgi B Schiöth, David E I Gloriam, Robert Fredriksson, Thóra K Bjarnadóttir"

Non-canonical functions of hunchback in segment patterning of the intermediate germ cricket Gryllus bimaculatus,15788457,10.1242/dev.01784,"In short and intermediate germ insects, only the anterior segments are specified during the blastoderm stage, leaving the posterior segments to be specified later, during embryogenesis, which differs from the segmentation process in Drosophila, a long germ insect. To elucidate the segmentation mechanisms of short and intermediate germ insects, we have investigated the orthologs of the Drosophila segmentation genes in a phylogenetically basal, intermediate germ insect, Gryllus bimaculatus (Gb). Here, we have focused on its hunchback ortholog (Gb'hb), because Drosophila hb functions as a gap gene during anterior segmentation, referred as a canonical function. Gb'hb is expressed in a gap pattern during the early stages of embryogenesis, and later in the posterior growth zone. By means of embryonic and parental RNA interference for Gb'hb, we found the following: (1) Gb'hb regulates Hox gene expression to specify regional identity in the anterior region, as observed in Drosophila and Oncopeltus; (2) Gb'hb controls germband morphogenesis and segmentation of the anterior region, probably through the pair-rule gene, even-skipped at least; (3) Gb'hb may act as a gap gene in a limited region between the posterior of the prothoracic segment and the anterior of the mesothoracic segment; and (4) Gb'hb is involved in the formation of at least seven abdominal segments, probably through its expression in the posterior growth zone, which is not conserved in Drosophila. These findings suggest that Gb'hb functions in a non-canonical manner in segment patterning. A comparison of our results with the results for other derived species revealed that the canonical hb function may have evolved from the non-canonical hb functions during evolution.",2005,"Sumihare Noji, Akihiro Iwahashi, Taro Mito, Hongjie Zhang, Isao Sarashina, Katsuyuki Miyawaki, Hideyo Ohuchi, Yohei Shinmyo, Haruko Okamoto"
Sequential learning of pheromonal cues modulates memory consolidation in trainer-specific associative courtship conditioning,15694302,10.1016/j.cub.2005.01.035,"Background: Associative memory formation requires that animals choose predictors for experiences they need to remember. When an artificial odor is paired with an aversive experience, that odor becomes the predictor. In more natural settings, however, animals can have multiple salient experiences that need to be remembered and prioritized. The mechanisms by which animals deal with multiple experiences are incompletely understood. Results: Here we show that Drosophila males can be trained to discriminate between different types of female pheromones; they suppress courtship specifically to the type of female that was associated with unsuccessful courtship. Such ""trainer-specific"" learning is mediated by hydrocarbon olfactory cues and modifies the male's processing of those cues. Animals that are unable to use olfactory cues can still learn by using other sensory modalities, but memory in this case is not specific to the trainer female's maturation state. Concurrent and serial presentation of different pheromones demonstrates that the ability to consolidate memory of pheromonal cues can be modified by the temporal order in which they appear. Conclusion: Suppression of memory by new learning demonstrates that the dynamics of memory consolidation are subject to plasticity in Drosophila. This type of metaplasticity is essential for navigation of experience-rich natural environments.",2005,"Joel D Levine, Aki Ejima, Christophe Lucas, Leslie C Griffith, Benjamin P C Smith"
Amyloid formation of a protein in the absence of initial unfolding and destabilization of the native state,16169977,10.1529/biophysj.105.067538,"In 5% (v/v) trifluoroethanol, pH 5.5, 25 degrees C one of the acylphosphatases from Drosophila melanogaster (AcPDro2) forms fibrillar aggregates that bind thioflavin T and Congo red and have an extensive beta-sheet structure, as revealed by circular dichroism. Atomic force microscopy indicates that the fibrils and their constituent protofilaments have diameters compatible with those of natural amyloid fibrils. Spectroscopic and biochemical investigation, carried out using near- and far-UV circular dichroism, intrinsic and 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonic acid-derived fluorescence, dynamic light scattering, and enzymatic activity assays, shows that AcPDro2 has, before aggregation, a secondary structure content packing around aromatic and hydrophobic residues, hydrodynamic diameter, and catalytic activity indistinguishable from those of the native protein. The native protein was found to have the same conformational stability under native and aggregating conditions, as determined from urea-induced unfolding. The kinetic analysis supports models in which AcPDro2 aggregates initially without need to unfold and subsequently undergoes a conformational change into amyloid-like structures. Although fully or partially unfolded states have a higher propensity to aggregate, the residual aggregation potential that proteins maintain upon complete folding can be physiologically relevant and be directly involved in the pathogenesis of some protein deposition diseases.",2005,"Matteo Ramazzotti, Francesco Bemporad, Annalisa Relini, Fabrizio Chiti, Gemma Soldi, Niccolò Taddei, Silvia Torrassa"
Molecular cloning and functional characterization of a neuronal choline transporter from Trichoplusia ni,15607656,10.1016/j.ibmb.2004.10.005,"A cDNA encoding a high-affinity Na(+)-dependent choline transporter (TrnCHT) was isolated from the CNS of the cabbage looper Trichoplusia ni using an RT-PCR-based approach. The deduced amino acid sequence of the CHT cDNA predicts a 594 amino acid protein of 64.74 kDa prior to glycosylation. TrnCHT has 80%, 79%, 76%, and 58% amino acid identity to putative CHTs from Anopheles gambiae, Drosophila melanogaster and Apis mellifera, and a cloned CHT from Limulus polyphemus, respectively. In situ hybridization of TrnCHT cRNA in whole-mount preparations of caterpillar CNS revealed that TrnCHT mRNA is expressed by hundreds of presumably cholinergic neurons present in both the brain and cortex of all segmental ganglia. Na(+)-dependent [(3)H]-choline uptake was induced in Sf9 cells in vitro following infection with a TrnCHT-expressing recombinant baculovirus. Virally induced [(3)H]-choline uptake was found to approximately equal the endogenous rate of choline uptake in insect cells, seen either after infection with a control virus or in TrnCHT-infected cells exposed to [(3)H]-choline in the absence of Na(+). The Na(+)-dependent component of [(3)H]-choline uptake by TrnCHT-infected cells was saturable with a K(m) for choline transport of 8.4 microM. Several compounds reported to be potent blockers of [(3)H]-choline uptake by cloned vertebrate choline transporters proved to be relatively weak inhibitors of choline uptake by Sf9 cells expressing TrnCHT. Hemicholinium-3 (K(i)=4.1 microM) and two oxoquinuclidium analogues of choline, quireston-A (K(i) approximately 10 microM) and quireston (K(i) approximately 100 microM) inhibited 50% of control uptake only at micromolar concentrations.

The apical determinants aPKC and dPatj regulate Frizzled-dependent planar cell polarity in the Drosophila eye,15907474,10.1016/j.cell.2005.03.014,"Planar cell polarity (PCP) is a common feature of many vertebrate and invertebrate epithelia and is perpendicular to their apical/basal (A/B) polarity axis. While apical localization of PCP determinants such as Frizzled (Fz1) is critical for their function, the link between A/B polarity and PCP is poorly understood. Here, we describe a direct molecular link between A/B determinants and Fz1-mediated PCP establishment in the Drosophila eye. We demonstrate that dPatj binds the cytoplasmic tail of Fz1 and propose that it recruits aPKC, which in turn phosphorylates and inhibits Fz1. Accordingly, components of the aPKC complex and dPatj produce PCP defects in the eye. We also show that during PCP signaling, aPKC and dPatj are downregulated, while Bazooka is upregulated, suggesting an antagonistic effect of Bazooka on dPatj/aPKC. We propose a model whereby the dPatj/aPKC complex regulates PCP by inhibiting Fz1 in cells where it should not be active.",2005,"Shaul Yogev, Marek Mlodzik, Alexandre Djiane"
The Drosophila meiotic mutant mei-352 is an allele of klp3A and reveals a role for a kinesin-like protein in crossover distribution,15965253,10.1534/genetics.105.041194,"The semisterile meiotic mutant mei-352 alters the distribution of meiotic exchanges without greatly affecting their total frequency. We show that the mei-352 mutation is an allele of the klp3A gene, which encodes a kinesin-like protein of the Kinesin-4 family. The semisterility observed in mei-352 females results from a known defect of klp3A oocytes in mediating pronuclear fusion. Interestingly, other klp3A alleles also exhibit defects in meiotic recombination similar to those of mei-352. Finally, we show that the Klp3A protein localizes within the oocyte nucleus during meiotic prophase, the time at which exchange distribution is established, and extensively colocalizes with DNA. The parallel of the klp3A phenotype with a meiotic defect observed for kar3 mutants in yeast suggests a role for kinesins in early meiosis and might reflect a previously suggested role for this class of kinesins in chromosome condensation.",2005,"Scott L Page, R Scott Hawley"
The histone H3.3 chaperone HIRA is essential for chromatin assembly in the male pronucleus,16251970,10.1038/nature04059,"In sexually reproducing animals, a crucial step in zygote formation is the decondensation of the fertilizing sperm nucleus into a DNA replication-competent male pronucleus. Genome-wide nucleosome assembly on paternal DNA implies the replacement of sperm chromosomal proteins, such as protamines, by maternally provided histones. This fundamental process is specifically impaired in sésame (ssm), a unique Drosophila maternal effect mutant that prevents male pronucleus formation. Here we show that ssm is a point mutation in the Hira gene, thus demonstrating that the histone chaperone protein HIRA is required for nucleosome assembly during sperm nucleus decondensation. In vertebrates, HIRA has recently been shown to be critical for a nucleosome assembly pathway independent of DNA synthesis that specifically involves the H3.3 histone variant. We also show that nucleosomes containing H3.3, and not H3, are specifically assembled in paternal Drosophila chromatin before the first round of DNA replication. The exclusive marking of paternal chromosomes with H3.3 represents a primary epigenetic distinction between parental genomes in the zygote, and underlines an important consequence of the critical and highly specialized function of HIRA at fertilization.",2005,"Timothy L Karr, Anne Laurençon, Caroline Anselme, Benjamin Loppin, Pierre Couble, Emilie Bonnefoy"
Drosophila DPM neurons form a delayed and branch-specific memory trace after olfactory classical conditioning,16325586,10.1016/j.cell.2005.09.037,"Formation of normal olfactory memory requires the expression of the wild-type amnesiac gene in the dorsal paired medial (DPM) neurons. Imaging the activity in the processes of DPM neurons revealed that the neurons respond when the fly is stimulated with electric shock or with any odor that was tested. Pairing odor and electric-shock stimulation increases odor-evoked calcium signals and synaptic release from DPM neurons. These memory traces form in only one of the two branches of the DPM neuron process. Moreover, trace formation requires the expression of the wild-type amnesiac gene in the DPM neurons. The cellular memory traces first appear at 30 min after conditioning and persist for at least 1 hr, a time window during which DPM neuron synaptic transmission is required for normal memory. DPM neurons are therefore ""odor generalists"" and form a delayed, branch-specific, and amnesiac-dependent memory trace that may guide behavior after acquisition.",2005,"Alex C Keene, Anjana Srivatsan, Ronald L Davis, Dinghui Yu, Scott Waddell"

Inferring the pattern of spontaneous mutation from the pattern of substitution in unitary pseudogenes of Mycobacterium leprae and a comparison of mutation patterns among distantly related organisms,16315108,10.1007/s00239-004-0235-0,"The pattern of spontaneous mutation can be inferred from the pattern of substitution in pseudogenes, which are known to be under very weak or no selective constraint. We modified an existing method (Gojobori T, et al., J Mol Evol 18:360, 1982) to infer the pattern of mutation in bacteria by using 569 pseudogenes from Mycobacterium leprae. In Gojobori et al.'s method, the pattern is inferred by using comparisons involving a pseudogene, a conspecific functional paralog, and an outgroup functional ortholog. Because pseudogenes in M. leprae are unitary, we replaced the missing paralogs by functional orthologs from M. tuberculosis. Functional orthologs from Streptomyces coelicolor served as outgroups. We compiled a database consisting of 69,378 inferred mutations. Transitional mutations were found to constitute more than 56% of all mutations. The transitional bias was mainly due to C-->T and G-->A, which were also the most frequent mutations on the leading strand and the only ones that were significantly more frequent than the random expectation. The least frequent mutations on the leading strand were A-->T and T-->A, each with a relative frequency of less than 3%. The mutation pattern was found to differ between the leading and the lagging strands. This asymmetry is thought to be the cause for the typical chirochoric structure of bacterial genomes. The physical distance of the pseudogene from the origin of replication (ori) was found to have almost no effect on the pattern of mutation. A surprising similarity was found between the mutation pattern in M. leprae and previously inferred patterns for such distant taxa as human and Drosophila. The mutation pattern on the leading strand of M. leprae was also found to share some common features with the pattern inferred for the heavy strand of the human mitochondrial genome. These findings indicate that taxon-specific factors may only play secondary roles in determining patterns of mutation.",2005,"Amir Mitchell, Dan Graur"
Fission yeast MO25 protein is localized at SPB and septum and is essential for cell morphogenesis,16096637,10.1038/sj.emboj.7600782,"Cell morphogenesis is of fundamental significance in all eukaryotes for development, differentiation, and cell proliferation. In fission yeast, Drosophila Furry-like Mor2 plays an essential role in cell morphogenesis in concert with the NDR/Tricornered kinase Orb6.

Here we show that the conserved proteins, MO25-like Pmo25, GC kinase Nak1, Mor2, and Orb6, constitute a morphogenesis network that is important for polarity control and cell separation. Intriguingly, Pmo25 was localized at the mitotic spindle pole bodies (SPBs) and then underwent translocation to the dividing medial region upon cytokinesis. Pmo25 formed a complex with Nak1 and was required for both the localization and kinase activity of Nak1. Pmo25 and Nak1 in turn were essential for Orb6 kinase activity. Further, the Pmo25 localization at the SPBs and the Nak1-Orb6 kinase activities during interphase were under the control of the Cdc7 and Sid1 kinases in the septation initiation network (SIN), suggesting a functional linkage between SIN and the network for cell morphogenesis/separation following cytokinesis.",2005,"David J Wiley, Muneyoshi Kanai, Keisuke Sakai, Klaus Leonhard, Kohji Miyahara, Dai Hirata, Takashi Toda, Fulvia Verde, Kazunori Kume, Keigo Nakamura"

"Geographic variation in diapause incidence, life-history traits, and climatic adaptation in Drosophila melanogaster",16331839,,"In Drosophila melanogaster, exposure of females to low temperature and shortened photoperiod can induce the expression of reproductive quiescence or diapause. Diapause expression is highly variable within and among natural populations and has significant effects on life-history profiles, including patterns of longevity, fecundity, and stress resistance. We hypothesized that if diapause expression is associated with overwintering mechanisms and adaptation to temperate environments, the frequency of diapause incidence would exhibit a latitudinal cline among natural populations. Because stress resistance and reproductive traits are also clinal in this species, we also examined how patterns of fecundity and longevity varied with geography and how stress resistance and associated traits differed constitutively between diapause and nondiapause lines. Diapause incidence was shown to vary predictably with latitude, ranging from 35% to 90% among natural populations in the eastern United States Survivorship under starvation stress differed between diapause and nondiapause lines; diapause phenotypes were also distinct for total body triglyceride content and the developmental distribution of oocytes in the ovary following stress exposure. Patterns of longevity, fecundity, and ovariole number also varied with geography. The data suggest that, for North American populations, diapause expression is functionally associated with overwintering mechanisms and may be an integral life-history component in natural populations.",2005,"Walter F Eanes, Paul S Schmidt, Michael Ippolito, Luciano Matzkin"
Identification and characterization of a Drosophila proteasome regulatory network,15899868,10.1128/MCB.25.11.4662-4675.2005,"Maintaining adequate proteasomal proteolytic activity is essential for eukaryotic cells. For metazoan cells, little is known about the composition of genes that are regulated in the proteasome network or the mechanisms that modulate the levels of proteasome genes. Previously, two distinct treatments have been observed to induce 26S proteasome levels in Drosophila melanogaster cell lines, RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated inhibition of the 26S proteasome subunit Rpn10/S5a and suppression of proteasome activity through treatment with active-site inhibitors. We have carried out genome array profiles from cells with decreased Rpn10/S5a levels using RNAi or from cells treated with proteasome inhibitor MG132 and have thereby identified candidate genes that are regulated as part of a metazoan proteasome network. The profiles reveal that the majority of genes that were identified to be under the control of the regulatory network consisted of 26S proteasome subunits. The 26S proteasome genes, including three new subunits, Ubp6p, Uch-L3, and Sem1p, were found to be up-regulated. A number of genes known to have proteasome-related functions, including Rad23, isopeptidase T, sequestosome, and the genes for the segregase complex TER94/VCP-Ufd1-Npl4 were also found to be up-regulated. RNAi-mediated inhibition against the segregase complex genes demonstrated pronounced stabilization of proteasome substrates throughout the Drosophila cell. Finally, transcriptional reporter assays and deletion mapping studies in Drosophila demonstrate that proteasome mRNA induction is dependent upon the 5' untranslated regions (UTRs). Transfer of the 5' UTR from the proteasome subunit Rpn1/S2 to a noninducible promoter was sufficient to confer transcriptional upregulation of the reporter mRNA after proteasome inhibition.",2005,"Josefin Lundgren, Zahra Mirzaei, Patrick Masson, Patrick Young"
Structure and Notch receptor binding of the tandem WWE domain of Deltex,16271883,10.1016/j.str.2005.07.015,"Deltex is a cytosolic effector of Notch signaling thought to bind through its N-terminal domain to the Notch receptor. Here we report the structure of the Drosophila Deltex N-terminal domain, which contains two tandem WWE sequence repeats. The WWE repeats, which adopt a novel fold, are related by an approximate two-fold axis of rotation. Although the WWE repeats are structurally distinct, they interact extensively and form a deep cleft at their junction that appears well suited for ligand binding. The two repeats are thermodynamically coupled; this coupling is mediated in part by a conserved segment that is immediately C-terminal to the second WWE domain. We demonstrate that although the Deltex WWE tandem is monomeric in solution, it forms a heterodimer with the ankyrin domain of the Notch receptor. These results provide structural and functional insight into how Deltex modulates Notch signaling, and how WWE modules recognize targets for ubiquitination.",2005,"Daniel J Leahy, Mark E Zweifel, Doug Barrick"
The pathophysiology of HOX genes and their role in cancer,15643670,10.1002/path.1710,"The HOM-C clustered prototype homeobox genes of Drosophila, and their counterparts, the HOX genes in humans, are highly conserved at the genomic level. These master regulators of development continue to be expressed throughout adulthood in various tissues and organs. The physiological and patho-physiological functions of this network of genes are being avidly pursued within the scientific community, but defined roles for them remain elusive. The order of expression of HOX genes within a cluster is co-ordinated during development, so that the 3' genes are expressed more anteriorly and earlier than the 5' genes. Mutations in HOXA13 and HOXD13 are associated with disorders of limb formation such as hand-foot-genital syndrome (HFGS), synpolydactyly (SPD), and brachydactyly. Haematopoietic progenitors express HOX genes in a pattern characteristic of the lineage and stage of differentiation of the cells. In leukaemia, dysregulated HOX gene expression can occur due to chromosomal translocations involving upstream regulators such as the MLL gene, or the fusion of a HOX gene to another gene such as the nucleoporin, NUP98. Recent investigations of HOX gene expression in leukaemia are providing important insights into disease classification and prediction of clinical outcome. Whereas the oncogenic potential of certain HOX genes in leukaemia has already been defined, their role in other neoplasms is currently being studied. Progress has been hampered by the experimental approach used in many studies in which the expression of small subsets of HOX genes was analysed, and complicated by the functional redundancy implicit in the HOX gene system. Attempts to elucidate the function of HOX genes in malignant transformation will be enhanced by a better understanding of their upstream regulators and downstream target genes.",2005,"A Kwasniewska, T R Lappin, A Thompson, H L Halliday, D G Grier, G J McGonigle"
The ESC-E(Z) complex participates in the hedgehog signaling pathway,15652519,10.1016/j.bbrc.2004.12.125,"Polycomb group (PcG) genes are required for stable inheritance of epigenetic states throughout development, a phenomenon termed cellular memory.

It has been argued that this methylation sets the stage for appropriate repression of certain genes. Here, we report the isolation of a well-conserved homolog of E(z), olezh2, in medaka. Hypomorphic knock-down of olezh2 resulted in a cyclopia phenotype and markedly perturbed hedgehog signaling, consistent with our previous report on oleed, a medaka esc. We also found cyclopia in embryos treated with trichostatin A, an inhibitor of histone deacetylase, which is a transient component of the ESC-E(Z) complex. The level of tri-methylation at lysine 27 of histone H3 was substantially decreased in both olezh2 and oleed knock-down embryos, and in embryos with hedgehog signaling perturbed by forskolin.

Breakdown of abdominal patterning in the Tribolium Kruppel mutant jaws,16280347,10.1242/dev.02154,"During Drosophila segmentation, gap genes function as short-range gradients that determine the boundaries of pair-rule stripes. A classical example is Drosophila Krüppel (Dm'Kr) which is expressed in the middle of the syncytial blastoderm embryo. Patterning defects in Dm'Kr mutants are centred symmetrically around its bell-shaped expression profile. We have analysed the role of Krüppel in the short-germ beetle Tribolium castaneum where the pair-rule stripes corresponding to the 10 abdominal segments arise during growth stages subsequent to the blastoderm. We show that the previously described mutation jaws is an amorphic Tc'Kr allele. Pair-rule gene expression in the blastoderm is affected neither in the amorphic mutant nor in Tc'Kr RNAi embryos. Only during subsequent growth of the germ band does pair-rule patterning become disrupted. However, only segments arising posterior to the Tc'Kr expression domain are affected, i.e. the deletion profile is asymmetric relative to the expression domain. Moreover, stripe formation does not recover in posterior abdominal segments, i.e. the Tc'Kr(jaws) phenotype does not constitute a gap in segment formation but results from a breakdown of segmentation past the 5th eve stripe. Alteration of pair-rule gene expression in Tc'Kr(jaws) mutants does not suggest a direct role of Tc'Kr in defining specific stripe boundaries as in Drosophila. Together, these findings show that the segmentation function of Krüppel in this short-germ insect is fundamentally different from its role in the long-germ embryo of Drosophila. The role of Tc'Kr in Hox gene regulation, however, is in better accordance to the Drosophila paradigm.",2005,"Alexander C Cerny, Reinhard Schröder, Gregor Bucher, Martin Klingler"
Role of the neuropeptide CCAP in Drosophila cardiac function,15898062,10.1002/neu.20136,"The heartbeat of adult Drosophila melanogaster displays two cardiac phases, the anterograde and retrograde beat, which occur in cyclic alternation. Previous work demonstrated that the abdominal heart becomes segmentally innervated during metamorphosis by peripheral neurons that express crustacean cardioactive peptide (CCAP). CCAP has a cardioacceleratory effect when it is applied in vitro. The role of CCAP in adult cardiac function was studied in intact adult flies using targeted cell ablation and RNA interference (RNAi). Optical detection of heart activity showed that targeted ablation of CCAP neurons selectively altered the anterograde beat, without apparently altering the cyclic cardiac reversal. Normal development of the abdominal heart and of the remainder of cardiac innervation in flies lacking CCAP neurons was confirmed by immunocytochemistry. Thus, in addition to its important role in ecdysis behavior (the behavior used by insects to shed the remains of the old cuticle at the end of the molt), CCAP may control the level of activity of the anterograde cardiac pacemaker in the adult fly. Expression of double stranded CCAP RNA in the CCAP neurons (targeted CCAP RNAi) caused a significant reduction in CCAP expression. However, this reduction was not sufficient to compromise CCAP's function in ecdysis behavior and heartbeat regulation.",2005,"Davide Dulcis, Richard B Levine, John Ewer"

Each Acp has multiple targets and is unique in its pattern of localization. Within the reproductive tract, Acps target to the uterus, oviduct, sperm storage organs, ovary and oocytes. Some Acps also leave the reproductive tract, to enter the hemolymph. Some Acps are detected on the surface of eggs laid by mated females but were not detectable within those eggs.

This chimeric gene, named siren, consists of a tandem duplicate of Adh and a retroposed fragment of CG11779 containing the promoter and a partial intron in addition to the first exon.

A transient luminal chitinous matrix is required to model epithelial tube diameter in the Drosophila trachea,16139230,10.1016/j.devcel.2005.07.012,"Epithelial tubes are found in many vital organs and require uniform and correct tube diameters for optimal function. Tube size depends on apical membrane growth and subapical cytoskeletal reorganization, but the cues that coordinate these events to ensure functional tube shape remain elusive. We find that epithelial tubes in the Drosophila trachea require luminal chitin polysaccharides to attain the correct diameter. Tracheal chitin forms a broad transient filament within the tubes during the restricted period of expansion. Loss of chitin causes tubular constrictions and cysts associated with irregular subapical cytoskeletal organization, without affecting epithelial integrity and polarity. Analysis of previously identified tube expansion mutants in genes encoding septate junction proteins further suggests that septate junction components may function in tubulogenesis through their role in luminal matrix assembly. We propose that the transient luminal protein/polysaccharide matrix is sensed by the epithelial cells and coordinates cytoskeletal organization to ensure uniform lumen diameter.",2005,"Anna Tonning, Christos Samakovlis, Erika Tång, Johanna Hemphälä, Anne Uv, Ulf Nannmark"

Pacemaker neurons respond to visual system inputs for clock resetting, but, unlike other neurons, have not been reported to transmit rapid signals to their targets. Here we show that pacemaker neurons are required to mediate a rapid behavior. The Drosophila larval visual system, Bolwig's organ (BO), projects to larval pacemaker neurons to entrain their clock. BO also mediates larval photophobic behavior. We found that ablation or electrical silencing of larval pacemaker neurons abolished light avoidance. Thus, circadian pacemaker neurons receive input from BO not only to reset the clock but also to transmit rapid photophobic signals. Furthermore, as clock gene mutations also affect photophobicity, the pacemaker neurons modulate the sensitivity of larvae to light, generating a circadian rhythm in visual sensitivity.",2005,"Justin Blau, Claude Desplan, Esteban O Mazzoni"
Functional analyses in the milkweed bug Oncopeltus fasciatus (Hemiptera) support a role for Wnt signaling in body segmentation but not appendage development,15939417,10.1016/j.ydbio.2005.04.034,"Specification of the proximal-distal (PD) axis of insect appendages is best understood in Drosophila melanogaster, where conserved signaling molecules encoded by the genes decapentaplegic (dpp) and wingless (wg) play key roles. However, the development of appendages from imaginal discs as in Drosophila is a derived state, while more basal insects produce appendages from embryonic limb buds. Therefore, the universality of the Drosophila limb PD axis specification mechanism has been debated since dpp expression in more basal insect species differs dramatically from Drosophila. Here, we test the function of Wnt signaling in the development of the milkweed bug Oncopeltus fasciatus, a species with the basal state of appendage development from limb buds. RNA interference of wg and pangolin (pan) produce defects in the germband and eyes, but not in the appendages. Distal-less and dachshund, two genes regulated by Wg signaling in Drosophila and expressed in specific PD domains along the limbs of both species, are expressed normally in the limbs of pan-depleted Oncopeltus embryos. Despite these apparently paradoxical results, Armadillo protein, the transducer of Wnt signaling, does not accumulate properly in the nuclei of cells in the legs of pan-depleted embryos. In contrast, engrailed RNAi in Oncopeltus produces cuticular and appendage defects similar to Drosophila. Therefore, our data suggest that Wg signaling is functionally conserved in the development of the germband, while it is not essential in the specification of the limb PD axis in Oncopeltus and perhaps basal insects.",2005,"David R Angelini, Thomas C Kaufman"
"Expression of mouse dchs1, fjx1, and fat-j suggests conservation of the planar cell polarity pathway identified in Drosophila",16059920,10.1002/dvdy.20515,"The dachsous (ds), fat (ft), and four-jointed (fj) genes have been identified in Drosophila as part of a signaling pathway that regulates planar cell polarity (PCP). A homologous PCP signaling pathway has also been identified in vertebrates, but nothing is known thus far about the conservation of Ds/Ft/Fj signaling. Here we analyzed and compared for the first time the expression patterns of all ds, ft and fj homologs in the mouse. During embryogenesis, expression analysis was performed by RNA in situ hybridization and in adult organs by real time PCR. As in Drosophila, we detected a complementary expression of fjx1 and dchs1 in organs like kidney, lung, and intestine. The ubiquitous expression of ft in several tissues in Drosophila appears to be split into an epithelial expression of fat1/fat3 and a mesenchymal expression of fat-j. These data are compatible with a conservation and sub-functionalization of the Drosophila Ds, Fj, and Fat signaling in higher vertebrates.",2005,"Manfred Gessler, Sabrina Schrauth, Rebecca Rock"
An inactive X specific replication origin associated with a matrix attachment region in the human X linked HPRT gene,15779006,10.1002/jcb.20425,"Early in female mammalian embryogenesis, one of the two X chromosomes is inactivated to compensate the gene dosage between males and females. One of the features of X chromosome inactivation (XCI) is the late replication of the inactivated X chromosome. This study reports the identification, by competitive PCR of nascent DNA, of a replication origin in intron 2 of the human X-linked HPRT gene, that is functional only on the inactive X. Features frequently associated with replication origins, including a peak of enhanced DNA flexibility, a perfect match to the yeast ACS sequence, a 14/15 match to the Drosophila topoisomerase II consensus, and a 20/21 match to an initiation region consensus sequence, were identified close to the replication origin.

But is there any specificity? This review tries to make a case for a non-redundant function of individual TLE/Grg proteins. The specificity may be brought about by a tightly controlled temporo-spatial expression pattern, post-translational modifications, and subtle structural differences leading to distinct preferences for interacting transcription factors. A confirmation of this concept will ultimately need to come from genetic experiments.",2005,"Florian Otto, Malgorzata Gasperowicz"
Isolation of a myoinhibitory peptide from Leishmania major (Kinetoplastida: Trypanosomatidae) and its function in the vector sand fly Phlebotomus papatasi (Diptera: Psychodidae),15799523,10.1093/jmedent/42.2.142,"Protozoan parasites in the genus Leishmania are ingested by sand flies with blood and multiply in the gut until they are transmitted to a vertebrate host when the sand fly blood feeds again. Infections of the enzootic vector Phlebotomus papatasi Scopoli result in distended midguts with no spontaneous gut contractions. Using a P. papatasi hindgut contraction bioassay, a paralytic factor sensitive to trypsin, chymotrypsin, proteinase-K, and heating at 56 degrees C was detected in crude lysates of Leishmania major promastigotes. Application of parasite lysate to isolated hindguts resulted in reversible, dose-dependent inhibition of spontaneous contractions. Mean volume of isolated midguts and hindguts increased by 50-60% after application of L. major lysate. L. major paralytic factor was purified 10(4)-fold over the total protein preparation and yielded a hydrophobic 12-kDa peptide. Myoinhibitory activity eluted as a single peak in reverse phase-high-pressure liquid chromatography. Tandem mass spectrometry resulted in 15 amino acid sequences, three of them sharing 45-73% homology with short hypothetical gene products of undefined function from Pseudomonas, Halobacterium, and Drosophila. This unique protozoan peptide mimics the function of endogenous insect neuropeptides that control visceral muscle contractions. By this novel mechanism, parasites persist in the expanded, relaxed midgut after blood meal and peritrophic matrix digestion. This allows time for development and migration of infective forms, facilitating sand fly vector competence and parasite transmission.",2005,Rajeev Vaidyanathan
Mechanisms of translational regulation in Drosophila,15762846,10.1042/BC20040097,"Translational regulation plays an essential role in many phases of the Drosophila life cycle. During embryogenesis, specification of the developing body pattern requires co-ordination of the translation of oskar, gurken and nanos mRNAs with their subcellular localization. In addition, dosage compensation is controlled by Sex-lethal-mediated translational regulation while dFMR1 (the Drosophila homologue of the fragile X mental retardation protein) controls translation of various mRNAs which function in the nervous system. Here we describe some of the mechanisms that are utilized to regulate these various processes.

The coevolution of insect muscle TpnT and TpnI gene isoforms,16049195,10.1093/molbev/msi223,"In bilaterians, the main regulator of muscle contraction is the troponin (Tpn) complex, comprising three closely interacting subunits (C, T, and I). To understand how evolutionary forces drive molecular change in protein complexes, we have compared the gene structures and expression patterns of Tpn genes in insects. In this class, while TpnC is encoded by multiple genes, TpnT and TpnI are encoded by single genes. Their isoform expression pattern is highly conserved within the Drosophilidae, and single orthologous genes were identified in the sequenced genomes of Drosophila pseudoobscura, Anopheles gambiae, and Apis mellifera. Apis expression patterns also support the equivalence of their exon organization throughout holometabolous insects. All TpnT genes include a previously unidentified indirect flight muscle (IFM)-specific exon (10A) that has evolved an expression pattern similar to that of exon 9 in TpnI. Thus, expression patterns, sequence evolution trends, and structural data indicate that Tpn genes and their isoforms have coevolved, building species- and muscle-specific troponin complexes. Furthermore, a clear case can be made for independent evolution of the IFM-specific isoforms containing alanine/proline-rich sequences. Dipteran genomes contain one tropomyosin gene that encodes one or two high-molecular weight isoforms (TmH) incorporating APPAEGA-rich sequences, specifically expressed in IFM. Corresponding exons do not exist in the Apis tropomyosin gene, but equivalent sequences occur in a high-molecular weight Apis IFM-specific TpnI isoform (TnH). Overall, our approach to comparatively analyze supramolecular complexes reveals coevolutionary trends not only in gene families but in isoforms generated by alternative splicing.",2005,"Margarita Cervera, Elena García-Zaragoza, Raúl Herranz, Roberto Marco, Jesús Mateos, José A Mas"
Quantitative trait loci for aggressive behavior in Drosophila melanogaster,19414563,10.1534/genetics.109.101691,"Aggressive behavior is observed across animal taxa and is likely to be evolutionarily conserved. Although potentially advantageous, aggression can have social and health consequences in humans, and is a component of a number of psychiatric disorders. As a complex genetic trait, it is modulated by numerous quantitative trait loci (QTL) with allelic effects that can vary in direction and magnitude and that are sensitive to environmental perturbations. Assays to quantify aggressive behavior in Drosophila melanogaster have been developed, making this an ideal model system in which to dissect the genomic architecture underlying manifestation of and variation in aggressive behavior. Here, we map QTL affecting variation in aggression between two wild-type Drosophila strains. We identified a minimum of five QTL in a genomewide scan: two on chromosome 2 and three on chromosome 3. At least three and possibly all five of these QTL interact epistatically. We used deficiency complementation mapping to subdivide two linked, epistatically interacting QTL of large effect on chromosome 3 into at least six QTL, and complementation tests to mutations identified four candidate quantitative trait genes.

dXNP/DATRX increases apoptosis via the JNK and dFOXO pathway in Drosophila neurons,19406101,10.1016/j.bbrc.2009.04.112,"Mutation of the XNP/ATRX gene, which encodes an SNF2 family ATPase/helicase protein, leads to ATR-X syndrome and several other X-linked mental retardation syndromes. Although XNP/ATRX is a chromatin remodeler, the molecular mechanism by which mental retardation occurs in patients with ATR-X has yet to be determined. To better understand the role of XNP/ATRX in neuronal development, we expressed Drosophila XNP (dXNP/DATRX) ectopically in Drosophila neurons. Neuronal expression of dXNP/DATRX resulted in various developmental defects and induced strong apoptosis. These defects and apoptosis were suppressed by Drosophila inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1. Expression of dXNP/DATRX also increased JNK activity and the levels of reaper and hid transcripts, which are pro-apoptotic factors that activate caspase. Furthermore, dXNP/DATRX-induced rough eye phenotype and apoptosis were suppressed by dFOXO deficiency. These results suggest that dXNP/DATRX is involved in caspase-dependent apoptosis in Drosophila neurons via regulation of the JNK and dFOXO pathway.",2009,"Nam Gon Lee, Min Jung Lee, Yoon Seak Suh, Yoon Ki Hong, Soojin Hwang, Gilsang Jeong, Seung Yeop Han, Min Soo Park, Kyoung Sang Cho, Gahee Choi"
Allele-specific expression assays using Solexa,19740431,10.1186/1471-2164-10-422,"Background: Allele-specific expression (ASE) assays can be used to identify cis, trans, and cis-by-trans regulatory variation. Understanding the source of expression variation has important implications for disease susceptibility, phenotypic diversity, and adaptation. While ASE is commonly measured via relative fluorescence at a SNP, next generation sequencing provides an opportunity to measure ASE in an accurate and high-throughput manner using read counts. Results: We introduce a Solexa-based method to perform large numbers of ASE assays using only a single lane of a Solexa flowcell. In brief, transcripts of interest, which contain a known SNP, are PCR enriched and barcoded to enable multiplexing. Then high-throughput sequencing is used to estimate allele-specific expression using sequencing counts. To validate this method, we measured the allelic bias in a dilution series and found high correlations between measured and expected values (r>0.9, p < 0.001). We applied this method to a set of 5 genes in a Drosophila simulans parental mix, F1 and introgression and found that for these genes the majority of expression divergence can be explained by cis-regulatory variation. Conclusion: We present a new method with the capacity to measure ASE for large numbers of assays using as little as one lane of a Solexa flowcell.

Mitochondrial impacts of insecticidal formate esters in insecticide-resistant and insecticide-susceptible Drosophila melanogaster,19278021,10.1002/ps.1747,"Background: Previous research on insecticidal formate esters in flies and mosquitoes has documented toxicity profiles, metabolism characteristics and neurological impacts. The research presented here investigated mitochondrial impacts of insecticidal formate esters and their hydrolyzed metabolite formic acid in the model dipteran insect Drosophila melanogaster Meig. These studies compared two Drosophila strains: an insecticide-susceptible strain (Canton-S) and a strain resistant by cytochrome P450 overexpression (Hikone-R). Results: In initial studies investigating inhibition of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase, two proven insecticidal materials (hydramethylnon and sodium cyanide) caused significant inhibition. However, for insecticidal formate esters and formic acid, no significant inhibition was identified in either fly strain. Mitochondrial impacts of formate esters were then investigated further by tracking toxicant-induced cytochrome c release from mitochondria into the cytoplasm, a biomarker of apoptosis and neurological dysfunction. Formic acid and three positive control treatments (rotenone, antimycin A and sodium cyanide) induced cytochrome c release, verifying that formic acid is capable of causing mitochondrial disruption. However, when comparing formate ester hydrolysis and cytochrome c release between Drosophila strains, formic acid liberation was only weakly correlated with cytochrome c release in the susceptible Canton-S strain (r(2) = 0.70). The resistant Hikone-R strain showed no correlation (r(2) < 0.0001) between formate ester hydrolysis and cytochrome c release. Conclusion: The findings of this study provide confirmation of mitochondrial impacts by insecticidal formate esters and suggest links between mitochondrial disruption, respiratory inhibition, apoptosis and formate-ester-induced neurotoxicity.",2009,"Michael E Scharf, Cheol Song"

The absence in these organisms of mechanisms that promote muscle regeneration, and substantially different hormonal environment, warrant caution when extrapolating experimental data from studies conducted in invertebrates to mammalian species.

Select Drosophila glomeruli mediate innate olfactory attraction and aversion,19396157,10.1038/nature07983,"Fruitflies show robust attraction to food odours, which usually excite several glomeruli. To understand how the representation of such odours leads to behaviour, we used genetic tools to dissect the contribution of each activated glomerulus. Apple cider vinegar triggers robust innate attraction at a relatively low concentration, which activates six glomeruli. By silencing individual glomeruli, here we show that the absence of activity in two glomeruli, DM1 and VA2, markedly reduces attraction. Conversely, when each of these two glomeruli was selectively activated, flies showed as robust an attraction to vinegar as wild-type flies. Notably, a higher concentration of vinegar excites an additional glomerulus and is less attractive to flies. We show that activation of the extra glomerulus is necessary and sufficient to mediate the behavioural switch. Together, these results indicate that individual glomeruli, rather than the entire pattern of active glomeruli, mediate innate behavioural output.",2009,"Jing W Wang, Julia L Semmelhack"
"Alternative splicing in the voltage-gated sodium channel DmNav regulates activation, inactivation, and persistent current",19625535,10.1152/jn.00613.2009,"Diversity in neuronal signaling is a product not only of differential gene expression, but also of alternative splicing. However, although recognized, the precise contribution of alternative splicing in ion channel transcripts to channel kinetics remains poorly understood. Invertebrates, with their smaller genomes, offer attractive models to examine the contribution of splicing to neuronal function. In this study we report the sequencing and biophysical characterization of alternative splice variants of the sole voltage-gated Na+ gene (DmNav, paralytic), in late-stage embryos of Drosophila melanogaster. We identify 27 unique splice variants, based on the presence of 15 alternative exons. Heterologous expression, in Xenopus oocytes, shows that alternative exons j, e, and f primarily influence activation kinetics: when present, exon f confers a hyperpolarizing shift in half-activation voltage (V1/2), whereas j and e result in a depolarizing shift. The presence of exon h is sufficient to produce a depolarizing shift in the V1/2 of steady-state inactivation. The magnitude of the persistent Na+ current, but not the fast-inactivating current, in both oocytes and Drosophila motoneurons in vivo is directly influenced by the presence of either one of a pair of mutually exclusive, membrane-spanning exons, termed k and L. Transcripts containing k have significantly smaller persistent currents compared with those containing L. Finally, we show that transcripts lacking all cytoplasmic alternatively spliced exons still produce functional channels, indicating that splicing may influence channel kinetics not only through change to protein structure, but also by allowing differential modification (i.e., phosphorylation, binding of cofactors, etc.). Our results provide a functional basis for understanding how alternative splicing of a voltage-gated Na+ channel results in diversity in neuronal signaling.",2009,"Richard A Baines, Nara I Muraro, Duncan E Wright, Wei-Hsiang Lin"

In addition, Drosophila S2 cultured cells, when pre-exposed to mild ER stress, are protected from H(2)O(2), cycloheximide- or ultraviolet-induced cell death.

Mutations in GATA4, the mammalian homolog of pnr, have also been implicated in causing human cardiac disease in a haploinsufficient manner. Mouse models of Gata4 loss-of-function and gain-of-function studies underscored the importance of Gata4 in regulating cardiac progenitor cells specification and differentiation. However, it is not known whether pnr/Gata4 is directly involved in establishing and maintaining adult heart physiology because of the lethality associated with defective heart function and redundancy among various GATA factors in vertebrates. Here, we took advantage of the Drosophila heart model to examine the function of pnr in adult heart physiology. We found that pnr heterozygous mutants result in defective cardiac performance in response to electrical pacing of the heart as well as in elevated arrhythmias. Adult-specific disruption of pnr function using a dominant-negative form pnrEnR revealed a cardiac autonomous requirement of pnr in regulating heart physiology. Moreover, we identified Tbx20/neuromancer (nmr) as a potential downstream mediator of pnr in regulating cardiac performance and rhythm regularity, based on the observation that overexpression of nmr genes, but not of tinman, partially rescues the adult defects in pnr mutants. We conclude that pnr is not only essential for early cardiac progenitor formation, along with tinman and T-box factors, but also plays an important role in establishing and/or maintaining proper heart function, which is partially through another key regulator Tbx20/nmr.",2009,"Li Qian, Rolf Bodmer"
Origins of correlated activity in an olfactory circuit,19684589,10.1038/nn.2376,"Multineuronal recordings often reveal synchronized spikes in different neurons. The manner in which correlated spike timing affects neural codes depends on the statistics of correlations, which in turn reflects the connectivity that gives rise to correlations. However, determining the connectivity of neurons recorded in vivo can be difficult. We investigated the origins of correlated activity in genetically labeled neurons of the Drosophila antennal lobe. Dual recordings showed synchronized spontaneous spikes in projection neurons (PNs) postsynaptic to the same type of olfactory receptor neuron (ORN). Odors increased these correlations. The primary origin of correlations lies in the divergence of each ORN onto every PN in its glomerulus. Reciprocal PN-PN connections make a smaller contribution to correlations and PN spike trains in different glomeruli were only weakly correlated. PN axons from the same glomerulus reconverge in the lateral horn, where pooling redundant signals may allow lateral horn neurons to average out noise that arises independently in these PNs.",2009,"Hokto Kazama, Rachel I Wilson"

The nAChR agonist-binding site is formed by loops A-C present in alpha subunits together with loops D-F present in either non-alpha subunits or homomer-forming alpha subunits. A new non-alpha subunit was cloned from Nilaparvata lugens, a major rice pest in many parts of Asia, showing very high amino acid identity to other insect beta1 subunits, and was denoted as N. lugens beta1 (Nlbeta1). Six A-to-I RNA editing sites were found in Nlbeta1 N-terminal domain, in which only one site was previously reported in Drosophila melanogaster Dbeta1 and the other five were newly identified. Among the six editing sites, four caused amino acid changes, in which the site 2 (E2) and site 5 (E5) caused an N to D change in loop D (N73D) and loop E (N133D) respectively. E2 frequency was high in Sus (susceptible) strain and E5 frequency was high in Res (resistant) strain. By expressing in Xenopus oocytes, N73D editing was found to reduce the agonist potency of both ACh and imidacloprid, and the influence on ACh was more significant than on imidacloprid. By contrast, N133D editing only affected imidacloprid potency.

A Drosophila gustatory receptor essential for aversive taste and inhibiting male-to-male courtship,19765987,10.1016/j.cub.2009.07.061,"Contact chemosensation is required for several behaviors that promote insect survival. These include evasive behaviors such as suppression of feeding on repellent compounds, known as antifeedants, and inhibition of male-to-male courtship. However, the gustatory receptors (GRs) required for responding to nonvolatile avoidance chemicals are largely unknown. Exceptions include Drosophila GR66a and GR93a, which are required to prevent ingestion of caffeine, and GR32a, which is necessary for inhibiting male-to-male courtship. However, GR32a is dispensable for normal taste. Thus, distinct GRs may function in sensing avoidance pheromones and antifeedants. Here, we describe the requirements for GR33a, which is expressed widely in gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs) that respond to aversive chemicals. Gr33a mutant flies were impaired in avoiding all nonvolatile repellents tested, ranging from quinine to denatonium, lobeline, and caffeine. Gr33a mutant males also displayed increased male-to-male courtship, implying that it functioned in the detection of a repulsive male pheromone. In contrast to the broadly required olfactory receptor (OR) OR83b, which is essential for trafficking other ORs, GR66a and GR93a are localized normally in Gr33a mutant GRNs. Thus, rather than regulating GR trafficking, GR33a may be a coreceptor required for sensing all nonvolatile repulsive chemicals, including tastants and pheromones.",2009,"Youngseok Lee, Yuchen Jiao, Seok Jun Moon, Craig Montell"

Two genes were identified, named hebe (CG1623) and magu (CG2264), that when over-expressed in adult flies could increase life span by approximately 5-30% in both sexes and increase female fecundity at late ages. Transcripts for magu are enriched in the Drosophila stem cell niche region, and magu encodes a protein related to the human SMOC2 regulator of angiogenesis. While moderate over-expression of magu in adult females increased fecundity at late ages, high-level over-expression of magu was maternal-effect lethal.

The archipelago tumor suppressor gene limits rb/e2f-regulated apoptosis in developing Drosophila tissues,19733076,10.1016/j.cub.2009.07.068,"Background: The Drosophila archipelago gene (ago) encodes the specificity component of a ubiquitin ligase that targets the cyclin E and dMyc proteins for degradation. Its human ortholog, Fbw7, is commonly lost in cancers, suggesting that failure to degrade ago/Fbw7 targets drives excess tissue growth. Results: We find that ago loss induces hyperplasia of some organs but paradoxically reduces the size of the adult eye. This reflects a requirement for ago to restrict apoptotic activity of the rbf1/de2f1 pathway adjacent to the eye-specific morphogenetic furrow (MF): ago mutant cells display elevated de2f1 activity, express the prodeath dE2f1 targets hid and rpr, and undergo high rates of apoptosis. These phenotypes are dependent on rbf1, de2f1, hid, and the rbf1/de2f1 regulators cyclin E and dacapo but are independent of dp53. A transactivation-deficient de2f1 allele blocks MF-associated apoptosis of ago mutant cells but does not retard their clonal overgrowth, indicating that intact de2f1 function is required for the death but not overproliferation of ago cells. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and wingless (wg) alleles also modify the ago apoptotic phenotype, indicating that these pathways may modulate the underlying sensitivity of ago mutant cells to apoptotic signals. Conclusions: These data show that ago loss requires a collaborating block in cell death to efficiently drive tissue overgrowth and that this conditional phenotype reflects a role for ago in restricting apoptotic output of the rbf1/de2f1 pathway. Moreover, the susceptibility of ago mutant cells to succumb to this apoptotic program appears to depend on local variations in extracellular signaling that could thus determine tissue-specific fates of ago mutant cells.",2009,"M Melissa Gilbert, Brandon N Nicolay, Sarah C Nicholson, Maxim V Frolov, Kenneth H Moberg"

This gene was the only SLC6 gene induced by lithium, and was thus designated as Lithium-inducible SLC6 transporter or List. Either RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown or complete deletion of List resulted in a remarkable increase in the susceptibility of adult flies to lithium's toxic effects, whereas transgenic expression of wild-type List significantly suppressed the lithium hypersensitive phenotype of List-deficient flies. Other ions such as sodium, potassium and chloride did not induce List upregulation, nor did they affect the viability of flies with suppressed List expression. These results indicate that lithium's biochemical or physical properties, rather than general osmotic responses, are responsible for the lithium-induced upregulation of List, as well as for the lithium-susceptible phenotype observed in List knockdown flies. Interestingly, flies became significantly more susceptible to lithium toxicity when List RNAi was specifically expressed in glia than when it was expressed in neurons or muscles, which is consistent with potential glial expression of List. These results show that the List transporter confers resistance to lithium toxicity, possibly as a consequence of its amino acid transporter activity in CNS glia. Our results have provided a new avenue of investigation toward a better understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms that underlie lithium-responsive neurobiological process.",2009,"J Kasuya, T Kitamoto, G A Kaas"
The single NTPase gene of Drosophila melanogaster encodes an intracellular nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 6 (NTPDase6),19467631,10.1016/j.abb.2009.01.005,"I report here the cloning and characterization of a nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 6 (NTPDase6) encoded by the single Dmel/NTPase gene of Drosophila melanogaster. S2 cells stably transfected with the Drosophila NTPDase6 cDNA displayed strong UDPase activity only after addition of NP-40, indicating the intracellular location of the enzyme. The enzyme hydrolyzed UDP, GDP, and IDP equally well whereas other NDP and NTP were poor substrates. It was not or only partially inhibited by several modulators of the cell surface NTPDases, but was strongly inhibited upon oxidative cross-linking by copper phenanthroline. The decrease of activity correlated with dimer formation. Mutagenesis studies indicated that dimer formation required C42 in the transmembrane domain and C447 in the exoplasmic domain. Fluorescence microscopy revealed that the protein was located primarily in the ER. The substrate specificity and cellular localization of the Drosophila NTPDase6 suggest that it participates in Drosophila glycoprotein processing.",2009,Aileen F Knowles
Pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration: insights from a Drosophila model,19602483,10.1093/hmg/ddp314,"Pantothenate-Kinase-Associated-Neurodegeneration (PKAN) is a devastating disease, resulting from mutations in pantothenate kinase 2 (PANK2), one of the four human pantothenate kinase genes (PANK1-4). Interestingly, PanK2 appears to be the only mitochondria-targeted human PanK. It is unknown whether the mitochondria-targeted PanK is associated with any unique function, nor whether PKAN is due solely to the loss of pantothenate kinase activity. Drosophila PANK [fumble (fbl)] encodes several isoforms of pantothenate kinase products, one of which localizes to mitochondria and the others cytosol. fbl flies exhibit many characteristic features reminiscent of PKAN patients. Various forms of Drosophila fbl and human PANK2 were introduced into fbl flies to study their in vivo functions. Only mitochondria-targeted Fbl or human PanK2 was able to rescue fbl mutation, with the rescuing ability sensitive to the expression level of the transgene. Transgenic lines with low expression of normal Fbl or PanK2 displayed similar phenotypes as PANK2 mutant transgenic flies. These PanK2 mutants all showed reduced and phenotype severity-correlated in vitro pantothenate kinase activities. Amazingly, cytosolic PanK3 and PanK4 could mostly, but not fully, rescue fbl defects except the male sterility. Therefore, fbl appears to be the orthologue of human PANK2, and PanK2 is functionally more potent than PanK3 and PanK4 in vivo. We suggest that mitochondria-located pantothenate kinase is required to achieve the maximal enzymatic activity to fulfill the most challenging task such as maintaining male fertility and optimal neuronal functions, and PKAN features are mainly due to the reduction of the total cellular pantothenate kinase activity in the most susceptible regions.",2009,"Zhihao Wu, Shan Lv, Bing Zhou, Chenghua Li"
Genetic interactions between the Drosophila tumor suppressor gene ept and the stat92E transcription factor,19787055,10.1371/journal.pone.0007083,"Background: Tumor Susceptibility Gene-101 (TSG101) promotes the endocytic degradation of transmembrane proteins and is implicated as a mutational target in cancer, yet the effect of TSG101 loss on cell proliferation in vertebrates is uncertain. By contrast, Drosophila epithelial tissues lacking the TSG101 ortholog erupted (ept) develop as enlarged undifferentiated tumors, indicating that the gene can have anti-growth properties in a simple metazoan. A full understanding of pathways deregulated by loss of Drosophila ept will aid in understanding potential links between mammalian TSG101 and growth control. Principal findings: We have taken a genetic approach to the identification of pathways required for excess growth of Drosophila eye-antennal imaginal discs lacking ept. We find that this phenotype is very sensitive to the genetic dose of stat92E, the transcriptional effector of the Jak-Stat signaling pathway, and that this pathway undergoes strong activation in ept mutant cells. Genetic evidence indicates that stat92E contributes to cell cycle deregulation and excess cell size phenotypes that are observed among ept mutant cells. In addition, autonomous Stat92E hyper-activation is associated with altered tissue architecture in ept tumors and an effect on expression of the apical polarity determinant crumbs. Conclusions: These findings identify ept as a cell-autonomous inhibitor of the Jak-Stat pathway and suggest that excess Jak-Stat signaling makes a significant contribution to proliferative and tissue architectural phenotypes that occur in ept mutant tissues.",2009,"Kenneth H Moberg, Carolyn K Beam, M Melissa Gilbert, Brian S Robinson"
A quantitative RNAi screen for JNK modifiers identifies Pvr as a novel regulator of Drosophila immune signaling,19893628,10.1371/journal.ppat.1000655,"Drosophila melanogaster responds to gram-negative bacterial challenges through the IMD pathway, a signal transduction cassette that is driven by the coordinated activities of JNK, NF-kappaB and caspase modules. While many modifiers of NF-kappaB activity were identified in cell culture and in vivo assays, the regulatory apparatus that determines JNK inputs into the IMD pathway is relatively unexplored. In this manuscript, we present the first quantitative screen of the entire genome of Drosophila for novel regulators of JNK activity in the IMD pathway. We identified a large number of gene products that negatively or positively impact on JNK activation in the IMD pathway. In particular, we identified the Pvr receptor tyrosine kinase as a potent inhibitor of JNK activation. In a series of in vivo and cell culture assays, we demonstrated that activation of the IMD pathway drives JNK-dependent expression of the Pvr ligands, Pvf2 and Pvf3, which in turn act through the Pvr/ERK MAP kinase pathway to attenuate the JNK and NF-kappaB arms of the IMD pathway. Our data illuminate a poorly understood arm of a critical and evolutionarily conserved innate immune response. Furthermore, given the pleiotropic involvement of JNK in eukaryotic cell biology, we believe that many of the novel regulators identified in this screen are of interest beyond immune signaling.",2009,"Edan Foley, David Bond"
Molecular evolution of piRNA and transposon control pathways in Drosophila,20453205,10.1101/sqb.2009.74.052,"The mere prevalence and potential mobilization of transposable elements in eukaryotic genomes present challenges at both the organismal and population levels. Not only is transposition able to alter gene function and chromosomal structure, but loss of control over even a single active element in the germline can create an evolutionary dead end. Despite the dangers of coexistence, transposons and their activity have been shown to drive the evolution of gene function, chromosomal organization, and even population dynamics (Kazazian 2004). This implies that organisms have adopted elaborate means to balance both the positive and detrimental consequences of transposon activity. In this chapter, we focus on the fruit fly to explore some of the molecular clues into the long- and short-term adaptation to transposon colonization and persistence within eukaryotic genomes.",2009,"C D Malone, G J Hannon"
The TP53INP2 protein is required for autophagy in mammalian cells,19056683,10.1091/mbc.e08-07-0671,"Using a bioinformatic approach, we identified a TP53INP1-related gene encoding a protein with 30% identity with tumor protein 53-induced nuclear protein 1 (TP53INP1), which was named TP53INP2. TP53INP1 and TP53INP2 sequences were found in several species ranging from Homo sapiens to Drosophila melanogaster, but orthologues were found neither in earlier eukaryotes nor in prokaryotes. To gain insight into the function of the TP53INP2 protein, we carried out a yeast two-hybrid screening that showed that TP53INP2 binds to the LC3-related proteins GABARAP and GABARAP-like2, and then we demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation that TP53INP2 interacts with these proteins, as well as with LC3 and with the autophagosome transmembrane protein VMP1. TP53INP2 translocates from the nucleus to the autophagosome structures after activation of autophagy by rapamycin or starvation. Also, we showed that TP53INP2 expression is necessary for autophagosome development because its small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown strongly decreases sensitivity of mammalian cells to autophagy. Finally, we found that interactions between TP53INP2 and LC3 or the LC3-related proteins GABARAP and GABARAP-like2 require autophagy and are modulated by wortmannin as judged by bioluminescence resonance energy transfer assays. We suggest that TP53INP2 is a scaffold protein that recruits LC3 and/or LC3-related proteins to the autophagosome membrane by interacting with the transmembrane protein VMP1. It is concluded that TP53INP2 is a novel gene involved in the autophagy of mammalian cells.",2009,"Joël Tardivel-Lacombe, Guillermo Velasco, Jean-Charles Dagorn, Cendrine Archange, Marie-Josèphe Pébusque, Pierre Pontarotti, Maria Inés Vaccaro, Jonathan Nowak, Juan Lucio Iovanna"

Duplicated proteasome subunit genes in Drosophila and their roles in spermatogenesis,19277057,10.1038/hdy.2009.23,"The proteasome is a large, multisubunit complex that acts as the cell's 'protein-degrading machine' in the ubiquitin-mediated proteolytic pathway for regulated protein turnover. Although proteasomes are usually thought of as being homogeneous structures, recent studies have revealed their more dynamic and heterogeneous nature. For example, in a number of plant and animal species, multiple isoforms of several proteasome subunits, encoded by paralogous genes, have been discovered, and in some cases, these alternative isoforms have been shown to be functionally distinct from their conventional counterparts. A particularly striking example of this phenomenon is seen in Drosophila melanogaster, where 12 of the 33 subunits that make up the 26S proteasome holoenzyme are represented in the genome by multiple paralogous genes. Remarkably, in every case, the 'extra' genes are expressed in a testis-specific manner. Here, we describe the extent and nature of these testis-specific gene duplications and discuss their functional significance, and speculate on why this situation might have evolved.",2009,"L Zhong, J M Belote"
hPOC5 is a centrin-binding protein required for assembly of full-length centrioles,19349582,10.1083/jcb.200808082,"Centrin has been shown to be involved in centrosome biogenesis in a variety of eukaryotes. In this study, we characterize hPOC5, a conserved centrin-binding protein that contains Sfi1p-like repeats. hPOC5 is localized, like centrin, in the distal portion of human centrioles. hPOC5 recruitment to procentrioles occurs during G2/M, a process that continues up to the full maturation of the centriole during the next cell cycle and is correlated with hyperphosphorylation of the protein. In the absence of hPOC5, RPE1 cells arrest in G1 phase, whereas HeLa cells show an extended S phase followed by cell death. We show that hPOC5 is not required for the initiation of procentriole assembly but is essential for building the distal half of centrioles. Interestingly, the hPOC5 family reveals an evolutionary divergence between vertebrates and organisms like Drosophila melanogaster or Caenorhabditis elegans, in which the loss of hPOC5 may correlate with the conspicuous differences in centriolar structure.",2009,"Alexey Khodjakov, Polla Hergert, Ursula Euteneuer, Etienne Formstecher, Michel Bornens, Juliette Azimzadeh, Annie Delouvée"

We have cloned and characterized the gastrulation defective gene and determined that it encodes a protein structurally related to the serine protease superfamily, which also includes the Snake, Easter, and Nudel proteins.

"Motor nerve terminals on abdominal muscles in larval flesh flies, Sarcophaga bullata: comparisons with Drosophila",9845243,,"Motor nerve terminals on abdominal body-wall muscles 6A and 7A in larval flesh flies were investigated to establish their general structural features with confocal microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and freeze-fracture procedures. As in Drosophila and other dipterans, two motor axons supply these muscles, and two morphologically different terminals were discerned with confocal microscopy: thin terminals with relatively small varicosities (Type Is), and thicker terminals with larger varicosities (Type Ib). In serial electron micrographs, Type Ib terminals were distinguished from Type Is terminals by their larger cross-sectional area, more extensive subsynaptic reticulum, more mitochondrial profiles, and more clear synaptic vesicles. Type Ib terminals possessed larger synapses and more synaptic contact area per unit terminal length. Although presynaptic dense bars of active zones were similar in mean length for the two terminal types, there were almost twice as many dense bars per synapse for Type Ib terminals. Freeze-fractures through the presynaptic membrane showed particle-free areas indicative of synapses on the P-face, within which were localized aggregations of large intramembranous particles indicative of active zones. These particles were similar in number to those found at active zones of several other arthropod neuromuscular junctions. In general, synaptic structural parameters strongly paralleled those of the anatomically homologous muscles in Drosophila melanogaster. In live preparations, simultaneous focal recording from identified varicosities and intracellular recording indicated that the two terminals produced excitatory junction potentials of similar amplitude in a physiological solution similar to that used for Drosophila.",1998,"J Pearce, H L Atwood, C K Govind, C J Feeney, S Karunanithi"

Studies of coracle, a Drosophila Protein 4.1 homologue, provide an opportunity to examine the genetic functions of this gene family. coracle was originally identified as a dominant suppressor of EgfrElp, a hypermorphic form of the Drosophila Epidermal growth factor receptor gene. In this article, we present a phenotypic analysis of coracle, one of the first for a member of the Protein 4. 1 superfamily. Screens for new coracle alleles confirm the null coracle phenotype of embryonic lethality and failure in dorsal closure, and they identify additional defects in the embryonic epidermis and salivary glands. Hypomorphic coracle alleles reveal functions in many imaginal tissues. Analysis of coracle mutant cells indicates that Coracle is a necessary structural component of the septate junction required for the maintenance of the transepithelial barrier but is not necessary for apical-basal polarity, epithelial integrity, or cytoskeletal integrity. In addition, coracle phenotypes suggest a specific role in cell signaling events.

Sequential roles for Otx2 in visceral endoderm and neuroectoderm for forebrain and midbrain induction and specification,9449667,,"The homeobox gene Otx2 is a mouse cognate of the Drosophila orthodenticle gene, which is required for development of the brain, rostral to rhombomere three. We have investigated the mechanisms involved in this neural function and specifically the requirement for Otx2 in the visceral endoderm and the neuroectoderm using chimeric analysis in mice and explant recombination assay. Analyses of chimeric embryos composed of more than 90% of Otx2-/- ES cells identified an essential function for Otx2 in the visceral endoderm for induction of the forebrain and midbrain. The chimeric studies also demonstrated that an anterior neural plate can form without expressing Otx2. However, in the absence of Otx2, expression of important regulatory genes, such as Hesx1/Rpx, Six3, Pax2, Wnt1 and En, fail to be initiated or maintained in the neural plate. Using explant-recombination assay, we could further demonstrate that Otx2 is required in the neuroectodem for expression of En. Altogether, these results demonstrate that Otx2 is first required in the visceral endoderm for the induction, and subsequently in the neuroectoderm for the specification of forebrain and midbrain territories.",1998,"A Dierich, W Shawlot, M Le Meur, S L Ang, R R Behringer, M Rhinn"

Truncation mutations in the transactivation region of PAX6 result in dominant-negative mutants,9705283,10.1074/jbc.273.34.21531,"PAX6 is a transcription factor with two DNA-binding domains (paired box and homeobox) and a proline-serine-threonine (PST)-rich transactivation domain. PAX6 regulates eye development in animals ranging from jellyfish to Drosophila to humans. Heterozygous mutations in the human PAX6 gene result in various phenotypes, including aniridia, Peter's anomaly, autosomal dominant keratitis, and familial foveal dysplasia. It is believed that the mutated allele of PAX6 produces an inactive protein and aniridia is caused due to genetic haploinsufficiency. However, several truncation mutations have been found to occur in the C-terminal half of PAX6 in patients with Aniridia resulting in mutant proteins that retain the DNA-binding domains but have lost most of the transactivation domain. It is not clear whether such mutants really behave as loss-of-function mutants as predicted by haploinsufficiency. Contrary to this theory, our data showed that these mutants are dominant-negative in transient transfection assays when they are coexpressed with wild-type PAX6. We found that the dominant-negative effects result from the enhanced DNA binding ability of these mutants. Kinetic studies of binding and dissociation revealed that various truncation mutants have 3-5-fold higher affinity to various DNA-binding sites when compared with the wild-type PAX6. These results provide a new insight into the role of mutant PAX6 in causing aniridia.",1998,"G F Saunders, J Y Lee, H K Tang, S Singh"

We found almost equivalent expression of these two splicing variants in most human tissues; however, in skeletal muscle the transcript with the 99-bp insertion was predominant, and in the brain, that without the 99-bp insertion was expressed predominantly. We also examined alternative splicing in the region between the SH3 and GUK domains where two different sizes of insertions, 34 nucleotides (I2) or 100 nucleotides (I3), had been reported, and found various splicing patterns among the tissues examined. In brain we detected six different, alternatively spliced transcripts, two of which included a novel, 36-bp, brain-specific exon encoding a peptide bearing significant homology to a portion of rat synapse-associated protein, SAP97/PSD95. Subsequently, we investigated the splicing patterns of the hDLG1 gene in 24 neuroblastoma cell lines. In two-thirds of these lines, the splicing patterns were altered from those observed in normal brain tissue. As one-third retained the normal brain-splicing pattern, the loss of normal splicing of hDLG1 may not in itself cause formation of tumors, but it might reflect the biological character of individual neuroblastomas.",1998,"K Kofu, K Mori, Y Nakamura, T Akiyama, A Nakagawara, K Iwao, N Arita, T Hayakawa, Y Miyoshi"

The traditional hypothesis is that older males have proven their viability and therefore produce offspring of superior genetic quality. This hypothesis is often evoked as an explanation for female preference for older mates. In contrast, we have recently argued that older fathers may produce offspring of inferior genetic quality. Here, we present results from an experiment designed to measure the genetic quality of offspring produced by 2 day old, 2 week old and 5 week old male D. melanogaster. We found a statistically significant small reduction in larval viability and a similar but statistically non-significant reduction in son mating ability among the offspring of the 5 week old males. Daughter fecundity showed no apparent trend for a reduction nor an increase in performance with increasing age of the fathers. There was no evidence of a difference between the 2 day old and the 2 week old males for any of these three fitness components. These results are in somewhat better accordance with our alternative hypothesis, but the relatively weak and late occurring effects indicate that mate choice based on age may not be a viable strategy in this population.",1998,"T F Hansen, D K Price"

As a first step in elucidating the genetic control of the differences between these species, we examined the mating and aggressive behaviour of their reciprocal F1 hybrids. The latency to the first wing vibration and the latency to copulate did not differ significantly between the parental species. However, D. heteroneura females had a very low tendency to copulate with D. silvestris males, rarely mating during the observation period. The duration of copulation also differed significantly; same-species pairs of D. silvestris had copulations that lasted about 50% longer than those of same-species pairs of D. heteroneura. The hybrids were intermediate between the parental species for both the tendency to copulate with D. silvestris males and the duration of copulation, suggesting codominance or polygenic inheritance for those traits. The aggression traits that we scored were the leg posture and wing extension during early aggression, and the leg posture and head position during escalated aggression. The parental species showed clear differences for each of these traits. The F1 hybrids resembled one parent or the other, without showing intermediate values, suggesting single-gene dominance or threshold expression of many genes for those traits. None of the courtship or aggressive traits showed X-chromosomal effects, although the head shape of hybrids is influenced by genes on the X chromosome.

In autosomally identical heterozygous combination, the substitution of a large segment of the D. virilis X chromosome with a double or a triple inversion from the sister taxa decreased male sterility from 96.4% (Xvirilis) to 11% (Xvirilis/novamexicana), 19% (Xvirilis/americana) and 34% (Xvirilis/lummei). This result shows that the Xvirilis interaction with D. novamexicana elements (Y and/or autosomes) is a major component in the F1 sterility observed. When males with a substituted Ylummei in otherwise pure D. novamexicana were crossed with D. virilis females, all the F1 males were fertile. We constructed combinations of intact Xvirilis, recombinant Xvirilis/novamexicana, Ynovamexicana and Ylummei chromosomes in homozygous D. virilis and heterozygous D. virilis/D. novamexicana autosomal backgrounds. In such combinations, the Y chromosome interacted strongly not only with the nonconspecific X chromosome, but with several autosomes. Autosomal hybrid sterility contributions tend to be recessive and not present in the F1. In this species group, the role of the Y chromosome is central in contributing to the phenomenon called Haldane's rule of sterility, but the Y chromosomal incompatibility factor of D. novamexicana is the most divergent one.",1998,"J Lumme, E Heikkinen"
"[A genetic factor, suppressing DNA underreplication in Drosophila melanogaster polytene chromosomes]",9719924,,"The Drosophila melanogaster line carrying the In(I)scv2 was found to exhibit unique cytological phenotype distinguished by the lack of ""weak"" points in the intercalary heterochromatin of the salivary gland polytene chromosomes, the absence of ectopic contacts between the chromosome regions, and the occurrence of additional intercalary heterochromatin in the centromeric regions. Southern blot hybridization revealed the absence of DNA underreplication in the intercalary heterochromatin region 39E carrying the histone gene cluster. This phenotype may have arisen under the influence of a genetic factor, Su(UR), which suppressed DNA underreplication in polytene chromosomes. Genetic analysis of the inheritance of the ""suppression of DNA underreplication"" phenotype showed that this factor was located in the third chromosome and was expressed in a semidominant manner. Discovery of Su(UR) suggested existence of common mechanisms regulating DNA underreplication in the centromeric and intercalary heterochromatin regions containing genes that were completely inactivated during ontogeny. These results confirm the assumption of common mechanisms of epigenetic repression of highly repetitive, somewhat repetitive, and unique sequences of the Drosophila genome.",1998,"D E Koriakov, E S Beliaeva, A A Alekseenko, Iu M Moshkin, I F Zhimulev"
Sexual selection related to developmental stability in Drosophila buzzatii,9652230,10.1111/j.1601-5223.1998.00115.x,"Relationships among developmental stability, sexual selection, and body size were examined in the cactophilic fly Drosophila buzzatii. Developmental stability, as measured in terms of fluctuating asymmetry (FA) of wing length, was positively associated to male's copulatory success in a mass-mating experiment with wild-reared flies. Previous studies showed that body size is positively correlated with mating success and other fitness components in this species, but no phenotypic correlation between wing asymmetry and size was found in the present study. Thus, wing asymmetry does not indicate male quality in terms of phenotypic variation in body size. This study suggests that sexual selection against wing asymmetry may be mediated through unknown factors related to developmental stability rather than body size.",1998,"J C Vilardi, F M Norry, E Hasson"
"The Drosophila LIM-only gene, dLMO, is mutated in Beadex alleles and might represent an evolutionarily conserved function in appendage development",9724756,10.1073/pnas.95.18.10637,"The process of wing patterning involves precise molecular mechanisms to establish an organizing center at the dorsal-ventral boundary, which functions to direct the development of the Drosophila wing. We report that misexpression of dLMO, a Drosophila LIM-only protein, in specific patterns in the developing wing imaginal disc, disrupts the dorsal-ventral (D-V) boundary and causes errors in wing patterning. When dLMO is misexpressed along the anterior-posterior boundary, extra wing outgrowth occurs, similar to the phenotype seen when mutant clones lacking Apterous, a LIM homeodomain protein known to be essential for normal D-V patterning of the wing, are made in the wing disc. When dLMO is misexpressed along the D-V boundary in third instar larvae, loss of the wing margin is observed. This phenotype is very similar to the phenotype of Beadex, a long-studied dominant mutation that we show disrupts the dLMO transcript in the 3' untranslated region. dLMO normally is expressed in the wing pouch of the third instar wing imaginal disc during patterning. A mammalian homolog of dLMO is expressed in the developing limb bud of the mouse. This indicates that LMO proteins might function in an evolutionarily conserved mechanism involved in patterning the appendages.",1998,"N J Justice, L Y Jan, C Zeng, Y M Chan, Y N Jan, S Abdelilah"

"A second maternally expressed Drosophila gene encodes a putative RNA helicase of the ""DEAD box"" family",1900936,10.1073/pnas.88.6.2113,"Recently, a family of proteins containing the conserved motif Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp, the ""DEAD box"" proteins, has been identified. This family is typified by the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF4A, and its members are believed to share the functional property of ATP-dependent RNA unwinding. One of the previously identified members of this family (vasa) is the product of a maternally expressed gene from Drosophila melanogaster that is known to play a role in the formation of the embryonic body plan. We report here the isolation of a Drosophila gene that has an mRNA expression pattern somewhat similar to that of vasa and also encodes a DEAD box protein. We have termed this gene ME31B to reflect its maternal (ovarian germ-line) expression and its location within the 31B chromosome region. Comparisons with the other members of this family reveal that although ME31B is most like the protein Tif1/Tif2, which probably represents the Saccharomyces cerevisiae version of eIF4A, it is unlikely that ME31B represents the Drosophila eIF4A protein per se. A search for mutations in the ME31B gene has established that the P element which causes the female-sterile mutation flipper lies in the 3' flank of the ME31B gene.",1991,"L A Camp, M A Tucker, K Beckingham, T de Valoir, E J Belikoff, C Bolduc"

The eggshell of the cherry fly Rhagoletis cerasi,18621185,10.1016/0040-8166(91)90027-q,"One of the major pests in Greek cherry orchards is the cherry fly Rhagoletis cerasi (Diptera: Tephritidae). In order to complete our comparative work on the chorion assembly of other representatives of the fruit flies (e.g. Ceratitis capitata and Dacus oleae) we studied eggshell morphogenesis in the cherry fly. The oocyte is surrounded by several distinct layers which are produced during choriogenesis. The eggshell consists of the vitelline membrane, a fibrous layer of possible water-proofing function, an innermost chorionic layer, endochorionic and exochorionic layers. The endochorion shows a branched configuration with irregular cavities, and the exochorion consists of inner and outer layers for better embryo protection. At the anterior region of the follicle, the hexagonal borders of the follicle cells are created by endochorionic material, covered by both inner and outer exochorion. This area resembles the D. melanogaster chorionic appendages and therefore can serve for plastron respiration. The structural results support the phylogenetic relationships among the tephritids (Rhagoletis is closer to Ceratitis than Dacus). The presence of peroxidase in the endochorion, detected by diaminobenzidine, is consistent with the eggshell hardening at the end of choriogenesis, following the same pattern with the other fruit flies studied so far. Two major chorionic proteins are found both in R. cerasi and in C. capitata and therefore general conclusions can be drawn from this study, concerning the pattern of choriogenesis, which all dipteran insects follow, in order to create a resistant and functional eggshell, and the high conservation of the proteinaceous components of the chorion among species in the order.",1991,"L H Margaritis, D G Mouzaki"

Evaluation of Drosophila for screening developmental toxicants: test results with eighteen chemicals and presentation of a new Drosophila bioassay,1686822,10.1002/tcm.1770110304,"The objective of this study was to generate a comprehensive data set of chemically induced malformations in Drosophila using a detailed morphological examination of the entire fly (phase one). These data were analyzed, in blind, with the goal of developing a standardized set of criteria which could be used in a new, rapid, and economical Drosophila bioassay useful in the preliminary screening for potential developmental toxicants. After 32 chemicals were tested, formalized criteria were developed to form the basis of a new Drosophila bioassay. These criteria were then applied to the data from the same 32 chemicals (phase two). The data from only 18 of these chemicals met all requirements for evaluation, e.g., statistical significance, minimum fly numbers, sufficient challenge concentration administered, etc. In the new bioassay, rather than the detailed and time-consuming examination of the entire fly for a multitude of morphological defects, only two specific anatomical sites are examined. These sites are the humeral bristle and the wing blade, with focus placed on two structural defects--a bent bristle and a notch in the wing. These defects were the only two external malformations among the multitude of defects observed in flies treated in the first phase with the 32 chemicals which demonstrated the following characteristics: 1) A consistent concentration-response in flies treated with a variety of developmental toxicants; 2) a lack of response with most presumptive non-developmental toxicants; and 3) consistently low-background incidences in control flies. In both phases, developing Drosophila were exposed to the test agents from the egg through three larval stages by incorporating a range of concentrations of each chemical into the culture medium. Emerging adults were examined for an array of defects as part of a detailed morphological examination in the first phase, including bent bristles and wing notches. In the second phase, only bent bristle and wing notch data were evaluated. The incidences of bent humeral bristles and wing notches from flies exposed to each of the 18 chemicals were compared with those of concurrent controls. Of the 18 chemicals that could be evaluated using the new bioassay, 13 were known developmental toxicants while the remaining 5 were presumptive negative agents. Ten of the 13 mammalian developmental toxicants were correctly identified with this test (false negative rate of 23%).

Regulation of doublesex pre-mRNA processing occurs by 3'-splice site activation,1936994,10.1101/gad.5.11.2071,"Sex-specific alternative processing of the doublesex (dsx) pre-mRNA controls somatic sexual differentiation in Drosophila melanogaster. Processing in the female-specific pattern results from the utilization of an upstream 3'-terminal exon and requires the activities of both the transformer (tra) and transformer-2 (tra-2) genes. Use of the more downstream male-specific terminal exons does not require the activities of these genes and is thus considered the default dsx-processing pattern. Here, we used transient expression of dsx pre-mRNAs in the presence or absence of tra and tra-2 gene products in Drosophila tissue culture cells to investigate the molecular mechanism controlling this alternative RNA-processing decision. These studies reveal that female-specific processing of dsx pre-mRNA is controlled by tra and tra-2 through the positive regulation of female-specific alternative 3'-terminal exon use. Delineation of cis-acting sequences necessary for regulation shows that a 540-nucleotide region from within the female exon is both necessary and sufficient for regulation. In addition, utilization of the female-specific 3'-splice site (3'SS) is regulated independently of female-specific polyadenylation. Regulated polyadenylation was obtained only in the presence of splicing, suggesting that activation of female-specific exon use occurs by 3'SS activation.",1991,"L C Ryner, B S Baker"
"Inhalation exposure in Drosophila mutagenesis assays: experiments with aliphatic halogenated hydrocarbons, with emphasis on the genetic activity profile of 1,2-dichloroethane",1996129,10.1016/0165-1161(91)90248-7,"A series of mutation experiments was carried out with Drosophila melanogaster using inhalation exposure. 1,2-Dichloroethane (DCE) and 1,2-dibromoethane (DBE) were active in the sex-linked recessive lethal assay (SLRLT), whereas dichloromethane, dibromomethane, 1,2-dichloropropane and 1,3-dichloropropane were not. Compared to DBE, DCE is a less potent mutagen in the SLRL system. For both compounds, there is no evidence of a clear-cut dose-rate effect. DCE and dichloromethane were also investigated in the somatic mutation and recombination test (SMART), with results similar to those from the SLRLT. For DCE the genetic activity profile was further analyzed by carrying out a sex-chromosome loss assay and a complementation analysis of a series of induced recessive lethal mutations. A review of the use of inhalation in mutagenicity assays with Drosophila shows that this route of exposure is an effective one. Especially with chronic exposure times, rather low exposure concentrations can be detected. With compounds of intermediate volatility inhalation is not superior to other modes of administration; nor is it likely to be sensitive enough for in situ monitoring.",1991,"H C Mout, C R Mulder, B Bissumbhar, P G Kramers"

We now report the isolation of a family of genes encoding a set of Drosophila protein kinases that appear to code for G protein-coupled receptor kinases.

Heat shock-regulated transcription in vitro from a reconstituted chromatin template,2034656,10.1073/pnas.88.10.4109,"To investigate the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation of Drosophila heat shock genes we studied the activity of a heat shock promoter in vitro after reconstitution into chromatin. Increasing the duration of nucleosome assembly progressively inactivated a plasmid template when it was transcribed with extracts of either unshocked or heat-shocked Drosophila embryos, despite induction of the transcriptional activator heat shock factor. Addition of the general transcription factor IID (TFIID) before nucleosome assembly did not significantly relieve nucleosomal inhibition, but TFIID potentiated the promoter to be responsive to activation by heat shock factor in the heat shock transcription extract. The potentiation by TFIID could be related to the nucleosome-free, hypersensitive state of heat shock promoters previously observed in vivo before heat shock induction and may be necessitated by the need to expedite activation of heat shock genes in response to environmental stress.",1991,"P B Becker, C Wu, S K Rabindran"
Lack of polymorphism on the Drosophila fourth chromosome resulting from selection,1686006,,"Evolutionary processes can be inferred from comparisons of intraspecific polymorphism and interspecific divergence.

We found no polymorphism within D. melanogaster and a single polymorphism within D. simulans; divergence between the species was about 5%. Comparison with the alcohol dehydrogenase gene and its two flanking regions in D. melanogaster, for which comparable data are available, revealed a statistically significant departure from neutrality in all three tests. This lack of polymorphism in the ciD locus may reflect recent positive selective sweeps on the fourth chromosome with extreme hitchhiking generated by the lack of recombination.

An ultrastructural analysis of the ecdysoneless (l(3)ecd1ts) ring gland during the third larval instar of Drosophila melanogaster,1786592,10.1007/BF00340866,"In the late third larval instar of Drosophila melanogaster, the prothoracic gland, an endocrine portion of the ring gland, synthesizes ecdysteroids at an accelerated rate. The resultant ecdysteroid titer peak initiates the events associated with metamorphosis. The normal prothoracic gland displays several ultrastructural features at this developmental stage that reflect increased steroidogenic activity, including extensive infoldings of the plasma membrane (membrane invaginations) and an increase in both the concentration of smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) (or transitional ER) and elongated mitochondria. By contrast, the prothoracic glands of larvae homozygous for a conditional larval lethal mutation, l(3)ecd1ts, not only fail to produce ecdysteroids at normal levels at the restrictive temperature (29 degrees C), but also acquire abnormal morphological features that reflect the disruptive effects of the mutation. These abnormalities include an accumulation of lipid droplets presumed to contain sterol precursors of ecdysteroids, a disappearance of SER and a drastic reduction of membrane invaginations in the peripheral area of the cell. These morphological defects are observed in prothoracic glands dissected from larvae transferred from 18 degrees C to 29 degrees C approximately 24 h before observation and also within 4 h of an in vitro transfer to 29 degrees C following dissection from wandering third instar larvae reared at 18 degrees C. No ultrastructural abnormalities were noted in the corpus allatum portion of mutant ring glands. These observations further indicate the direct involvement of the ecd gene product in ecdysteroid synthesis and suggest a role for the gene in the proper transport of precursors to the site where they can be utilized in ecdysteroid biosynthesis.",1991,"V C Henrich, J D Dai, L I Gilbert"
Characterization of the catalytic subunit of casein kinase II expressed in Escherichia coli and regulation of activity,1900838,,"The catalytic (alpha) subunit of casein kinase II from Drosophila, cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli (Saxena, A., Padmanabha, R., and Glover, C. V. C., (1987) Mol. Cell. Biol. 7, 3409-3417), has been purified and characterized, and the properties have been compared to those of the holoenzyme. The catalytic subunit exhibits protein kinase activity with casein as substrate and is autophosphorylated. The specific activity of the purified subunit is 6% of the activity of the holoenzyme from reticulocytes or from Drosophila. The alpha subunit is a monomer, eluting at Mr = 40,000 upon gel filtration in high salt, but as part of an aggregate in low salt. The alpha subunit has been purified to apparent homogeneity by sequential chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, Mono S, and Mono Q. A single band, Mr = 37,000, is detected by silver staining following polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The isolated alpha subunit displays apparent Km values for beta casein, ATP, and GTP similar to those of the holoenzyme. The activity of the alpha subunit is inhibited by heparin with an I50 of 0.1-0.3 micrograms/ml, a value similar to that observed for the holoenzyme; autophosphorylation is also inhibited by heparin. Polylysine has no stimulatory effect on the activity of the catalytic subunit, as measured with casein and by autophosphorylation, but stimulates both activities with the holoenzyme. When physiological substrates for casein kinase II are examined, glycogen synthase and eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF-3) (p120) are phosphorylated by the alpha subunit at a rate equivalent to that of the holoenzyme, while phosphorylation of eIF-3 (p67) is reduced 9-fold and eIF-2 beta is not modified. From these data, it can be concluded that the alpha subunit of casein kinase II is sufficient for catalysis, is autophosphorylated, and can be directly inhibited by heparin, whereas the beta subunit mediates the effects of basic stimulatory compounds and is involved in recognition and/or binding to specific physiological substrates.",1991,"W J Lin, P T Tuazon, J A Traugh"

Pem mRNA is increased in EC cells differentiated towards parietal or visceral endoderm, consistent with the abundant Pem expression in embryonic yolk sac. In 10T mesenchymal stem cells committed to muscle cell differentiation, Pem mRNA expression is dramatically increased. The elevation in Pem expression preceded the induction of the muscle master regulatory gene, myoD.

Requirement for cell-proliferation control genes in Drosophila oogenesis,2016052,,"Genes that are required for cell proliferation control in Drosophila imaginal discs were tested for function in the female germ-line and follicle cells. Chimeras and mosaics were produced in which developing oocytes and nurse cells were mutant at one of five imaginal disc overgrowth loci (fat, lgd, lgl, c43 and dco) while the enveloping follicle cells were normal. The chimeras were produced by transplantation of pole cells and the mosaics were produced by X-ray-induced mitotic recombination using the dominant female-sterile technique. The results show that each of the genes tested plays an essential role in the development or function of the female germ line. The fat, lgl and c43 homozygous germ-line clones fail to produce eggs, indicating a germ-line requirement for the corresponding genes. Perdurance of the fat+ gene product in mitotic recombination clones allows the formation of a few infertile eggs from fat homozygous germ-line cells. The lgd homozygous germ-line clones give rise to a few eggs with abnormal chorionic appendages, a defect thought to result from defective cell communication between the mutant germ-line and the nonmutant follicle cells. One allele of dco (dcole88) prevents egg development when homozygous in the germ line, whereas the dco18 allele has no effect on germ-line development. Fs(2)Ugra, a recently described follicle cell-dependent dominant female-sterile mutation, allowed the analysis of egg primordia in which fat, lgd or lgl homozygous mutant follicle cells surrounded normal oocytes.

Two receptors, Drosophila neurokinin receptor (NKD) and Drosophila tachykinin receptor (DTKR), with sequence similarities to mammalian tachykinin receptors have previously been cloned in Drosophila. In this study we have isolated a cockroach (Leucophaea maderae) cDNA clone by screening a brain cDNA library with a degenerate oligonucleotide probe based on a conserved sequence within the seventh transmembrane region of the Drosophila tachykinin receptors. This clone, Leucophaea tachykinin receptor (LTKR), encodes a portion of a putative receptor which could be aligned with the C-terminal half of members of the tachykinin receptor subfamily. In the fifth, sixth and seventh transmembrane regions the deduced amino acid sequence of LTKR exhibits 79% sequence identity to the DTKR receptor and 54% to that of NKD. This suggests that LTKR is orthologous to the DTKR receptor. To study the distribution of the predicted LTKR protein by immunocytochemistry, antisera were raised against synthetic peptides corresponding to a region of the third intracellular loop of LTKR. In the cockroach brain immunoreactive neuronal processes were seen in several synaptic neuropils of the protocerebrum and tritocerebrum as well as in the frontal ganglion. Some immunoreactive neuronal cell bodies were detected in the protocerebrum.

Induction of direct antimicrobial activity through mammalian toll-like receptors,11222859,10.1126/science.291.5508.1544,"The mammalian innate immune system retains from Drosophila a family of homologous Toll-like receptors (TLRs) that mediate responses to microbial ligands. Here, we show that TLR2 activation leads to killing of intracellular Mycobacterium tuberculosis in both mouse and human macrophages, through distinct mechanisms. In mouse macrophages, bacterial lipoprotein activation of TLR2 leads to a nitric oxide-dependent killing of intracellular tubercle bacilli, but in human monocytes and alveolar macrophages, this pathway was nitric oxide-independent. Thus, mammalian TLRs respond (as Drosophila Toll receptors do) to microbial ligands and also have the ability to activate antimicrobial effector pathways at the site of infection.",2001,"S Akira, J T Belisle, S Thoma-Uszynski, M Wagner, P J Godowski, R L Modlin, P F Barnes, B R Bloom, P L Bolcskei, M V Norgard, S Stenger, P A Sieling, M Engele, O Takeuchi, M Rollinghoff, M T Ochoa"
Mesodermal patterning defect in mice lacking the Ste20 NCK interacting kinase (NIK),11290295,,"We have previously shown that the Drosophila Ste20 kinase encoded by misshapen (msn) is an essential gene in Drosophila development. msn function is required to activate the Drosophila c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), basket (Bsk), to promote dorsal closure of the Drosophila embryo. Later in development, msn expression is required in photoreceptors in order for their axons to project normally. A mammalian homolog of msn, the NCK-interacting kinase (NIK) (recently renamed to mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase 4; Map4k4), has been shown to activate JNK and to bind the SH3 domains of the SH2/SH3 adapter NCK. To determine whether NIK also plays an essential role in mammalian development, we created mice deficient in NIK by homologous recombination at the Nik gene. Nik(-/-) mice die postgastrulation between embryonic day (E) 9.5 and E10.5. The most striking phenotype in Nik(-/-) embryos is the failure of mesodermal and endodermal cells that arise from the anterior end of the primitive streak (PS) to migrate to their correct location. As a result Nik(-/- )embryos fail to develop somites or a hindgut and are truncated posteriorly. Interestingly, chimeric analysis demonstrated that NIK has a cell nonautonomous function in stimulating migration of presomitic mesodermal cells away from the PS and a second cell autonomous function in stimulating the differentiation of presomitic mesoderm into dermomyotome. These findings indicate that despite the large number of Ste20 kinases in mammalian cells, members of this family play essential nonredundant function in regulating specific signaling pathways. In addition, these studies provide evidence that the signaling pathways regulated by these kinases are diverse and not limited to the activation of JNK because mesodermal and somite development are not perturbed in JNK1-, and JNK2-deficient mice.",2001,"Y Xue, X Wang, N Gotoh, Z Li, D Chapman, E Y Skolnik"
The paralogous Hox genes Hoxa10 and Hoxd10 interact to pattern the mouse hindlimb peripheral nervous system and skeleton,11180954,10.1006/dbio.2000.0130,"The most 5' mouse Hoxa and Hoxd genes, which occupy positions 9-13 and which are related to the Drosophila AbdB gene, are all active in patterning developing limbs. Inactivation of individual genes produces alterations in skeletal elements of both forelimb and hindlimb; inactivation of some of these genes also alters hindlimb innervation. Simultaneous inactivation of paralogous or nonparalogous Hoxa and Hoxd genes produces more widespread alterations, suggesting that combinatorial interactions between these genes are required for proper limb patterning. We have examined the effects of simultaneous inactivation of Hoxa10 and Hoxd10 on mouse hindlimb skeletal and nervous system development. These paralogous genes are expressed at lumbar and sacral levels of the developing neural tube and surrounding axial mesoderm as well as in developing forelimb and hindlimb buds. Double-mutant animals demonstrated impaired locomotor behavior and altered development of posterior vertebrae and hindlimb skeletal elements. Alterations in hindlimb innervation were also observed, including truncations and deletions of the tibial and peroneal nerves. Animals carrying fewer mutant alleles show similar, but less extreme phenotypes. These observations suggest that Hoxa10 and Hoxd10 coordinately regulate skeletal development and innervation of the hindlimb.",2001,"E M Carpenter, S L Hostikka, G M Wahba"
"Gibberellins signal nuclear import of PHOR1, a photoperiod-responsive protein with homology to Drosophila armadillo",11509183,10.1016/s0092-8674(01)00445-7,"S. tuberosum ssp. andigena potato plants require short days (SD) for tuberization. We have isolated PHOR1 (photoperiod-responsive 1), which shows upregulated expression in induced leaves (SD). PHOR1 encodes an arm repeat protein with homology to the Drosophila segment polarity protein armadillo. Antisense inhibition of PHOR1 produces a semidwarf phenotype similar to that of GA-deficient plants, and the antisense lines show reduced GA responsiveness combined with a higher endogenous GA content than wild-type plants. Feedback regulation of GA biosynthetic genes is also altered in these lines. Conversely, transgenic lines overexpressing PHOR1 show an enhanced response to GA. GA application induces rapid migration of PHOR1-GFP protein to the nucleus. Thus, PHOR1 appears to be a general component of GA signaling pathways that relocalizes to the nucleus in the presence of GA.",2001,"S Prat, J L García-Martínez, E Monte, V Amador"
Siah-1 mediates a novel beta-catenin degradation pathway linking p53 to the adenomatous polyposis coli protein,11389840,10.1016/s1097-2765(01)00241-6,"The adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor-suppressor protein, together with Axin and GSK3beta, forms a Wnt-regulated signaling complex that mediates phosphorylation-dependent degradation of beta-catenin by the proteasome. Siah-1, the human homolog of Drosophila seven in absentia, is a p53-inducible mediator of cell cycle arrest, tumor suppression, and apoptosis. We have now found that Siah-1 interacts with the carboxyl terminus of APC and promotes degradation of beta-catenin in mammalian cells. The ability of Siah-1 to downregulate beta-catenin signaling was also demonstrated by hypodorsalization of Xenopus embryos. Unexpectedly, degradation of beta-catenin by Siah-1 was independent of GSK3beta-mediated phosphorylation and did not require the F box protein beta-TrCP. These results indicate that APC and Siah-1 mediate a novel beta-catenin degradation pathway linking p53 activation to cell cycle control.",2001,"Y Hu, N Matsunami, H J Yost, J Stevens, R L White, J Liu, K L Neufeld, C A Rote"
All Tcf HMG box transcription factors interact with Groucho-related co-repressors,11266540,10.1093/nar/29.7.1410,"Tcf/Lef family transcription factors are the downstream effectors of the Wingless/Wnt signal transduction pathway. Upon Wingless/Wnt signalling, beta-catenin translocates to the nucleus, interacts with Tcf (1-3) and thus activates transcription of target genes (4,5). Tcf factors also interact with members of the Groucho (Grg/TLE) family of transcriptional co-repressors (6). We have now tested all known mammalian Groucho family members for their ability to interact specifically with individual Tcf/Lef family members. Transcriptional activation by any Tcf could be repressed by Grg-1, Grg-2/TLE-2, Grg-3 and Grg-4 in a reporter assay. Specific interactions between Tcf and Grg proteins may be achieved in vivo by tissue- or cell type-limited expression. To address this, we determined the expression of all Tcf and Grg/TLE family members in a panel of cell lines. Within any cell line, several Tcfs and TLEs are co-expressed. Thus, redundancy in Tcf/Grg interactions appears to be the rule. The 'long' Groucho family members containing five domains are repressors of Tcf-mediated transactivation, whereas Grg-5, which only contains the first two domains, acts as a de-repressor. As previously shown for Drosophila Groucho, we show that long Grg proteins interact with histone deacetylase-1. Although Grg-5 contains the GP homology domain that mediates HDAC binding in long Grg proteins, Grg-5 fails to bind this co-repressor, explaining how it can de-repress transcription.",2001,"H Brantjes, M van De Wetering, J Roose, H Clevers"
Circadian photoreception in Drosophila: functions of cryptochrome in peripheral and central clocks,11407780,10.1177/074873040101600303,"In Drosophila melanogaster, disruption of night by even short light exposures results in degradation of the clock protein TIMELESS (TIM), leading to shifts in the fly molecular and behavioral rhythms. Several lines of evidence indicate that light entrainment of the brain clock involves the blue-light photoreceptor cryptochrome (CRY). In cryptochrome-depleted Drosophila (cry(b)), the entrainment of the brain clock by short light pulses is impaired but the clock is still entrainable by light-dark cycles, probably due to light input from the visual system. Whether cryptochrome and visual transduction pathways play a role in entrainment of noninnervated, directly photosensitive peripheral clocks is not known and the subject of this study. The authors monitored levels of the clock protein TIM in the lateral neurons (LNs) of larval brains and in the renal Malpighian tubules (MTs) of flies mutant for the cryptochrome gene (cry(b)) and in mutants that lack signaling from the visual photopigments (norpA(P41)). In cry(b) flies, light applied during the dark period failed to induce degradation of TIM both in MTs and in LNs, yet attenuated cycling of TIM was observed in both tissues in LD. This cycling was abolished in LNs, but persisted in MTs, of norpA(P41);cry(b) double mutants. Furthermore, the activity of the tim gene in the MTs of cry(b) flies, reported by luciferase, seemed stimulated by lights-on and suppressed by lights-off, suggesting that the absence of functional cryptochrome uncovered an additional light-sensitive pathway synchronizing the expression of TIM in this tissue. In constant darkness, cycling of TIM was abolished in MTs; however, it persisted in LNs of cry(b) flies. The authors conclude that cryptochrome is involved in TIM-mediated entrainment of both central LN and peripheral MT clocks. Cryptochrome is also an indispensable component of the endogenous clock mechanism in the examined peripheral tissue, but not in the brain. Thus, although neural and epithelial cells share the core clock mechanism, some clock components and light-entrainment pathways appear to have tissue-specific roles.",2001,"J M Giebultowicz, M Ivanchenko, R Stanewsky"

The metacentric neo-Y chromosome has one arm with a complete heterochromatic ancestral Y and the other arm with a euchromatic ancestral autosome 3. The transcription study has revealed that the X chromosome in D. n. nasuta is hyperactive, suggesting complete dosage compensation, while in the neo-X chromosome of D. n. albomicans the ancestral X chromosome is hyperactive and the ancestral autosome 3, which is part of the neo-sex chromosome, is similar to any other autosomes.

Loss of cell cycle checkpoint control in Drosophila Rfc4 mutants,11438670,10.1128/MCB.21.15.5156-5168.2001,"Two alleles of the Drosophila melanogaster Rfc4 (DmRfc4) gene, which encodes subunit 4 of the replication factor C (RFC) complex, cause striking defects in mitotic chromosome cohesion and condensation. These mutations produce larval phenotypes consistent with a role in DNA replication but also result in mitotic chromosomal defects appearing either as premature chromosome condensation-like or precocious sister chromatid separation figures. Though the DmRFC4 protein localizes to all replicating nuclei, it is dispersed from chromatin in mitosis. Thus the mitotic defects appear not to be the result of a direct role for RFC4 in chromosome structure. We also show that the mitotic defects in these two DmRfc4 alleles are the result of aberrant checkpoint control in response to DNA replication inhibition or damage to chromosomes. Not all surveillance function is compromised in these mutants, as the kinetochore attachment checkpoint is operative. Intriguingly, metaphase delay is frequently observed with the more severe of the two alleles, indicating that subsequent chromosome segregation may be inhibited. This is the first demonstration that subunit 4 of RFC functions in checkpoint control in any organism, and our findings additionally emphasize the conserved nature of RFC's involvement in checkpoint control in multicellular eukaryotes.",2001,"S A Krause, M L Loupart, M M Heck, S Schoenfelder, S Vass, S Harrison"

A rapid method to map mutations in Drosophila,11574055,10.1186/gb-2001-2-9-research0036,"Background: Genetic screens in Drosophila have provided a wealth of information about a variety of cellular and developmental processes. It is now possible to screen for mutant phenotypes in virtually any cell at any stage of development by performing clonal screens using the flp/FRT system. The rate-limiting step in the analysis of these mutants is often the identification of the mutated gene, however, because traditional mapping strategies rely mainly on genetic and cytological markers that are not easily linked to the molecular map. Results: Here we describe the development of a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) map for chromosome arm 3R. The map contains 73 polymorphisms between the standard FRT chromosome, and a mapping chromosome that carries several visible markers (rucuca), at an average density of one SNP per 370 kilobases (kb). Using this collection, we show that mutants can be mapped to a 400 kb interval in a single meiotic mapping cross, with only a few hundred SNP detection reactions. Discovery of further SNPs in the region of interest allows the mutation to be mapped with the same recombinants to a region of about 50 kb. Conclusion: The combined use of standard visible markers and molecular polymorphisms in a single mapping strategy greatly reduces both the time and cost of mapping mutations, because it requires at least four times fewer SNP detection reactions than a standard approach. The use of this map, or others developed along the same lines, will greatly facilitate the identification of the molecular lesions in mutants from clonal screens.",2001,"K C Dobi, D St Johnston, S G Martin"

Drosophila Brain Tumor is a translational repressor,11274060,10.1101/gad.870801,"The Drosophila brain tumor (brat) gene encodes a member of the conserved NHL family of proteins, which appear to regulate differentiation and growth in a variety of organisms. One of the founding family members, Caenorhabditis elegans LIN-41, is thought to control posttranscriptional gene expression. However, the mechanism by which LIN-41, or any other NHL protein, acts has not been clear. Using a yeast ""four-hybrid"" interaction assay, we show that Brain Tumor is recruited to hunchback (hb) mRNA through interactions with Nanos and Pumilio, which bind to the RNA to repress its translation. Interaction with the Nanos/Pumilio/RNA complex is mediated by the Brat NHL domain; single amino acid substitutions in this domain compromise quaternary complex assembly in vitro and hb regulation in vivo. Thus, recruitment of Brat is necessary for translational repression and the normal development of posterior embryonic pattern. In addition to regulating abdominal segmentation, previous genetic analysis has shown that Brat, Nanos, and Pumilio govern a variety of developmental processes. We examined the role of Brat in two of these processes-regulation of maternal Cyclin B mRNA in the embryo and regulation of imaginal disc development. The results of these experiments suggest that NHL domain proteins are recruited to various mRNAs by combinatorial protein-protein interactions.",2001,"J Sonoda, R P Wharton"
Detecting microsatellites within genomes: significant variation among algorithms,17442102,10.1186/1471-2105-8-125,"Background: Microsatellites are short, tandemly-repeated DNA sequences which are widely distributed among genomes. Their structure, role and evolution can be analyzed based on exhaustive extraction from sequenced genomes. Several dedicated algorithms have been developed for this purpose. Here, we compared the detection efficiency of five of them (TRF, Mreps, Sputnik, STAR, and RepeatMasker). Results: Our analysis was first conducted on the human X chromosome, and microsatellite distributions were characterized by microsatellite number, length, and divergence from a pure motif. The algorithms work with user-defined parameters, and we demonstrate that the parameter values chosen can strongly influence microsatellite distributions. The five algorithms were then compared by fixing parameters settings, and the analysis was extended to three other genomes (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Neurospora crassa and Drosophila melanogaster) spanning a wide range of size and structure. Significant differences for all characteristics of microsatellites were observed among algorithms, but not among genomes, for both perfect and imperfect microsatellites. Striking differences were detected for short microsatellites (below 20 bp), regardless of motif. Conclusion: Since the algorithm used strongly influences empirical distributions, studies analyzing microsatellite evolution based on a comparison between empirical and theoretical size distributions should therefore be considered with caution. We also discuss why a typological definition of microsatellites limits our capacity to capture their genomic distributions.",2007,"Eric Rivals, Sébastien Leclercq, Philippe Jarne"

Ah receptor orthologs have been demonstrated to mediate diverse endogenous functions in our close vertebrate relatives as well as our distant invertebrate ancestors.

Functional analysis of a Drosophila melanogaster olfactory receptor expressed in Sf9 cells,16919756,10.1016/j.jneumeth.2006.07.005,"Olfactory receptors (ORs) are seven transmembrane proteins that are responsible for the transduction of volatiles into neuronal signals. Their low sequence homology means that the prediction of ligands for ORs based on extrapolation from empirical data of other ORs is difficult, so an experimental approach must be used. Here, we report a functional assay for insect ORs using calcium-imaging in Sf9 cells. We find that the interaction of the odorant, ethyl butyrate, with the Drosophila melanogaster olfactory receptor Or22a is both dose-dependent and highly sensitive, with Or22a responding to ethyl butyrate with an EC(50) of (1.58+/-0.82)x10(-11)M. This degree of sensitivity does not require the addition of odorant binding proteins or downstream signal transduction elements. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Or22a expressed in Sf9 cells has a similar response profile to a range of odorants previously tested in vivo.

Dichlorvos (0.015-15.0 ppb) without or with inhibitors of Hsp70, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) were fed to the third instar larvae of Drosophila melanogaster transgenic for hsp70 (hsp70-lacZ) Bg(9) to examine Hsp70 expression, oxidative stress and apoptotic markers. A concentration- and time-dependent significant increase in ROS generation accompanied by a significant upregulation of Hsp70 preceded changes in antioxidant defense enzyme activities and contents of glutathione, malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl in the treated organisms. An inhibitory effect on SOD and CAT activities significantly upregulated ROS generation and Hsp70 expression in the exposed organism while inhibition of Hsp70 significantly affected oxidative stress markers induced by the test chemical. A comparison made among ROS generation, Hsp70 expression and apoptotic markers showed that ROS generation is positively correlated with Hsp70 expression and apoptotic cell death end points indicating involvement of ROS in the overall adversity caused by the test chemical to the organism.

"Complex regulation and multiple developmental functions of misfire, the Drosophila melanogaster ferlin gene",17386097,10.1186/1471-213X-7-21,"Background: Ferlins are membrane proteins with multiple C2 domains and proposed functions in Ca2+ mediated membrane-membrane interactions in animals. Caenorhabditis elegans has two ferlin genes, one of which is required for sperm function. Mammals have several ferlin genes and mutations in the human dysferlin (DYSF) and otoferlin (OTOF) genes result in muscular dystrophy and hearing loss, respectively. Drosophila melanogaster has a single ferlin gene called misfire (mfr). A previous study showed that a mfr mutation caused male sterility because of defects in fertilization. Here we analyze the expression and structure of the mfr gene and the consequences of multiple mutations to better understand the developmental function of ferlins. Results: We show that mfr is expressed in the testis and ovaries of adult flies, has tissue-specific promoters, and expresses alternatively spliced transcripts that are predicted to encode distinct protein isoforms. Studies of 11 male sterile mutations indicate that a predicted Mfr testis isoform with five C2 domains and a transmembrane (TM) domain is required for sperm plasma membrane breakdown (PMBD) and completion of sperm activation during fertilization. We demonstrate that Mfr is not required for localization of Sneaky, another membrane protein necessary for PMBD. The mfr mutations vary in their effects in females, with a subset disrupting egg patterning and causing a maternal effect delay in early embryonic development. Locations of these mutations indicate that a short Mfr protein isoform carries out ferlin activities during oogenesis. Conclusion: The mfr gene exhibits complex transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation and functions in three developmental processes: sperm activation, egg patterning, and early embryogenesis. These functions are in part due to the production of protein isoforms that vary in the number of C2 domains. These findings help establish D. melanogaster as model system for understanding ferlin function and dysfunction in animals, including humans.",2007,"Michelle K Smith, Barbara T Wakimoto"

Precise control of fasciclin II expression is required for adult mushroom body development in Drosophila,17394600,10.1111/j.1440-169X.2007.00922.x,"Fasciclin II (FASII) is a cell adhesion molecule that participates in axonal pathfinding, fasciculation and divergence in the Drosophila nervous system. Here, we examined spatio-temporal control of fasII expression during the development of adult mushroom body (MB) and found that suppression of fasII in alpha'/beta' neurons is essential for the formation of adult alpha'/beta' and alpha/beta lobes. Of gamma, alpha'/beta' and alpha/beta neurons, which are derived sequentially from the same four MB neuroblasts, only gamma and alpha/beta neurons expressed fasII. When fasII was misexpressed in developing MB neurons, defects resulted, including loss or misdirection of adult alpha'/beta' lobes and concurrent misdirection of alpha/beta lobes. Although no gross anatomical defects were apparent in the larval MB lobes, alpha'/beta' lobes collapsed at the pupal stage when the larval lobe of gamma neurons degenerated. In addition, alpha/beta lobes, which developed at this time, were misdirected in close relationship with the collapse of alpha'/beta' lobes. These defects did not occur when fasII was overexpressed in only gamma and alpha/beta neurons, indicating that ectopic expression of fasII in alpha'/beta' neurons is required for the defects. Our findings also suggest that the alpha'/beta' lobe play a role in guiding the pathfinding by alpha/beta axons.",2007,"Hidenobu Tsujimura, Kazuma Fushima"
Evolution of gene function on the X chromosome versus the autosomes,18753787,10.1159/000107606,"Sex chromosomes have arisen from autosomes many times over the course of evolution. This process generates chromosomal heteromorphy between the sexes, which has important implications for the evolution of coding and noncoding sequences on the sex chromosomes versus the autosomes. The formation of sex chromosomes from autosomes involves a reduction in gene dosage, which can modify properties of selection pressure on sex-linked genes. This transition also generates differences in the effective population size and dominance characteristics of novel mutations on the sex chromosome versus the autosomes. All of these changes may affect both patterns of in situ gene evolution and the rates of interchromosomal gene duplication and movement. Here we present a synopsis of the current understanding of the origin of sex chromosomes, theoretical context for differences in rates and patterns of molecular evolution on the X chromosome versus the autosomes, as well as a summary of empirical molecular evolutionary data from Drosophila and mammalian genomes.",2007,"D A Petrov, N D Singh"
CAF-1 is essential for Drosophila development and involved in the maintenance of epigenetic memory,17916346,10.1016/j.ydbio.2007.08.039,"DNA synthesis during S-phase and upon DNA repair is accompanied by chromatin assembly. The chromatin assembly factor CAF-1 has been biochemically well-characterized to deposit histones onto newly synthesized DNA. To gain insights into the in vivo functions of CAF-1 in Drosophila, we generated null mutants of the largest subunit of dCAF-1, dCAF-1-p180. We show that, unlike CAF-1 mutant yeast, dCAF-1-p180 mutant flies are hemizygous lethal. Removal of maternal dCAF-1-p180 activity by germline clones blocks oogenesis. Tissue-specific deletion of dCAF-1-p180 in the eye primordia disrupts eye development. In addition, reduction of dCAF-1-p180 activity suppresses gene silencing at heterochromatin and antagonizes Polycomb-mediated cell fate determination. Furthermore, heterozygous dCAF-1-p180 mutant flies display an increased sensitivity to gamma-irradiation and a reduced efficiency in recombinational double strand break (DSB) repair. Our experiments also show that human hCAF-1-p150 can rescue the dCAF-1-p180 mutant flies, demonstrating a functional conservation of eukaryotic CAF-1 activities in vivo. Together, our results establish that dCAF-1-p180 is an essential gene for Drosophila development and further underscore the importance of dCAF-1 in regulating gene expression and DNA repair in vivo.",2007,"Yixu Chen, Igor Stagljar, Gengqiang Xie, Xiaoyan Guo, Xuehong Liang, Yanjuan Xu, Jun Ma, Renjie Jiao, Feng He, Yanjun Song, Dieter Egli"
Evolutionarily conserved E(y)2/Sus1 protein is essential for the barrier activity of Su(Hw)-dependent insulators in Drosophila,17643381,10.1016/j.molcel.2007.05.035,"Chromatin insulators affect interactions between promoters and enhancers/silencers and function as barriers for spreading of repressive chromatin. The Su(Hw) protein is responsible for activity of the best-studied Drosophila insulators. Here we demonstrate that an evolutionarily conserved protein, E(y)2/Sus1, is recruited to the Su(Hw) insulators via binding to the zinc-finger domain of Su(Hw). Partial inactivation of E(y)2 in a weak mutation, e(y)2(u1), impairs only the barrier, but not the enhancer-blocking, activity of the Su(Hw) insulators. Whereas neither su(Hw)(-) nor e(y)2(u1) affects fly viability, their combination proves lethal, testifying to functional interaction between Su(Hw) and E(y)2 in vivo.

A primary role of developmental instability in sexual selection,17939982,10.1098/rspb.2007.1272,"In evolutionary biology, fluctuating asymmetry (FA) is thought to reveal developmental instability (DI, inability to buffer development against perturbations), but its adaptive and genetic bases are being debated. In other fields, such as human clinical genetics, DI is being assessed as incidence of minor morphological abnormalities (MMAs) and used to predict certain fitness outcomes. Here, for the first time, we combine these complementary measures of DI in sexual selection and quantitative genetic studies of a natural population. Comprehensive multivariate analyses demonstrate that FA and MMAs in a condition-dependent sexual ornament, the male Drosophila bipectinata sex comb used in courtship, are sole significant targets of selection favouring their reduced expression in New Caledonia. Comb FA and MMAs are positively correlated, confirming that each are linked to a common buffering system. Ornament size and DI (as FA and MMAs) are positively correlated, genetically and phenotypically, contrary to theoretical expectation of negative size-FA scaling under the assumption that FA reveals overall genetic quality. There exists significant additive genetic variance for MMAs, demonstrating their evolutionary potential. Ornament DI in New Caledonia is markedly elevated compared with populations where such selection was not detected, suggesting that the increased population-level DI is capacitating adaptive evolution.",2007,"Michal Polak, Phillip W Taylor"
Structurally related Arabidopsis ANGUSTIFOLIA is functionally distinct from the transcriptional corepressor CtBP,17972097,10.1007/s00427-007-0186-8,"ANGUSTIFOLIA (AN) controls leaf morphology in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Previous studies on sequence similarity demonstrated that the closest proteins to AN are members of animal C-terminal-binding proteins (CtBPs) found in nematodes, arthropods, and vertebrates. Drosophila CtBP (dCtBP) functions as a transcriptional corepressor for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-binding repressors containing the short amino acid motif, PXDLS, to regulate tissue specification and segmentation during early embryogenesis. It has previously been shown that AN was thought to repress transcription similar to the function of CtBPs; however, AN lacks some of the structural features that are conserved in animal CtBPs. In this paper, we examined whether AN is functionally related to dCtBP. Firstly, we re-examined sequence similarity among AN and various CtBPs from several representative species in the plant and animal kingdoms. Secondly, yeast two-hybrid assays demonstrated that AN failed to interact with an authentic CtBP-interacting factor, adenovirus E1A oncoprotein bearing the PXDLS motif. Thirdly, AN tethered to DNA was unable to repress the expression of reporter genes in transgenic Drosophila embryos. Fourthly, overexpression assays suggested that dCtBP and AN function differently in Drosophila tissues. Finally, AN failed to rescue the zygotic lethality caused by dCtBP loss-of-function. These data, taken together, suggest that AN is functionally distinct from dCtBP. Likely, ancestral CtBPs acquired corepressor function (capability of both repression and binding to repressors containing the PXDLS motif) after the animal-plant divergence but before the protostome-deuterostome split. We therefore propose to categorize AN as a subfamily member within the CtBP/BARS/RIBEYE/AN superfamily.",2007,"Dereje Negeri, Hirokazu Tsukaya, Elizabeth Guevara, Huan Huan Sun, Gyung-Tae Kim, Hitoshi Aihara, Yutaka Nibu, Giorgio A Roccaro, Gorou Horiguchi, Mark D Stern, Kiu-Hyung Cho"
Branchio-oto-renal syndrome,17238186,10.1002/ajmg.a.31561,"Branchio-oto-renal syndrome, a phenotype consisting of hearing loss, auricular malformations, branchial arch remnants, and renal anomalies is now recognized as one of the more common forms of autosomal dominant syndromic hearing impairment. Three loci known to be associated with the BOR phenotype have been identified and two genes that act in a regulatory network have been cloned, EYA1 and SIX1. EYA1 and SIX1 are homologous to genes involved in Drosophila eye development, eyes absent gene (eya), and sine oculis (so), respectively. EYA1, a transcriptional co-activator has a conserved, 271-amino acid, C-terminal known as the Eya Domain (ED). SIX1 has two highly conserved domains; a homeodomain (HD) and a specific Six-domain (SD) whose products function as transcription factors with specific DNA-binding activity that are crucial for protein-protein interaction. To determine the molecular basis for the organ defects that occur in BOR syndrome, many studies have focused on the effects of mutations to EYA and effects of mutations of the EYA-SIX regulatory system. However, over 60% of BOR syndrome patients do not have known mutations in EYA1 and relatively little is known about mutations to SIX1. Further evaluation of SIX1 and its related target genes may provide a better understanding of the pathophysiology of BOR syndrome and offer greater clues to the disease mechanisms.",2007,"William J Kimberling, Stephanie M Fischer, Amit Kochhar, Richard J H Smith"
The ribosomal protein genes and Minute loci of Drosophila melanogaster,17927810,10.1186/gb-2007-8-10-r216,"Background: Mutations in genes encoding ribosomal proteins (RPs) have been shown to cause an array of cellular and developmental defects in a variety of organisms. In Drosophila melanogaster, disruption of RP genes can result in the 'Minute' syndrome of dominant, haploinsufficient phenotypes, which include prolonged development, short and thin bristles, and poor fertility and viability. While more than 50 Minute loci have been defined genetically, only 15 have so far been characterized molecularly and shown to correspond to RP genes. Results: We combined bioinformatic and genetic approaches to conduct a systematic analysis of the relationship between RP genes and Minute loci. First, we identified 88 genes encoding 79 different cytoplasmic RPs (CRPs) and 75 genes encoding distinct mitochondrial RPs (MRPs). Interestingly, nine CRP genes are present as duplicates and, while all appear to be functional, one member of each gene pair has relatively limited expression. Next, we defined 65 discrete Minute loci by genetic criteria. Of these, 64 correspond to, or very likely correspond to, CRP genes; the single non-CRP-encoding Minute gene encodes a translation initiation factor subunit. Significantly, MRP genes and more than 20 CRP genes do not correspond to Minute loci. Conclusion: This work answers a longstanding question about the molecular nature of Minute loci and suggests that Minute phenotypes arise from suboptimal protein synthesis resulting from reduced levels of cytoribosomes. Furthermore, by identifying the majority of haplolethal and haplosterile loci at the molecular level, our data will directly benefit efforts to attain complete deletion coverage of the D. melanogaster genome.",2007,"Steven J Marygold, Naoya Kenmochi, Gillian H Millburn, Gunter Reuter, Michael Ashburner, Kevin R Cook, Thomas C Kaufman, Andrew Lambertsson, Sally J Leevers, Zhan Yu, John Roote, Paul M Harrison"

In vertebrates and invertebrates, sexual maturation is under the influence of hormones and neuromodulators, but the role of developmental genes in this process is still poorly understood. We report that prospero (pros), a gene crucial for nervous system development, can change the age of onset of sexual behavior in Drosophila melanogaster males: adult males carrying a single copy of several pros mutations court females and mate at a younger age than control males. However, these pros mutations had no effect on female sexual receptivity and did not alter other male phenotypes related to mating behavior. The Pros protein was detected in several brain and sensory structures of immature adult males, some of which are normally involved in the regulation of male specific behaviors. Our data suggest that the altered pros expression affects the age of onset of male mating behavior.",2007,"Jean-François Ferveur, Yaël Grosjean, Laure Guenin, Henri-Marc Bardet"
The crystal structure of the rhomboid peptidase from Haemophilus influenzae provides insight into intramembrane proteolysis,17210913,10.1073/pnas.0609981104,"Rhomboid peptidases are members of a family of regulated intramembrane peptidases that cleave the transmembrane segments of integral membrane proteins. Rhomboid peptidases have been shown to play a major role in developmental processes in Drosophila and in mitochondrial maintenance in yeast. Most recently, the function of rhomboid peptidases has been directly linked to apoptosis. We have solved the structure of the rhomboid peptidase from Haemophilus influenzae (hiGlpG) to 2.2-A resolution. The phasing for the crystals of hiGlpG was provided mainly by molecular replacement, by using the coordinates of the Escherichia coli rhomboid (ecGlpG). The structural results on these rhomboid peptidases have allowed us to speculate on the catalytic mechanism of substrate cleavage in a membranous environment. We have identified the relative disposition of the nucleophilic serine to the general base/acid function of the conserved histidine. Modeling a tetrapeptide substrate in the context of the rhomboid structure reveals an oxyanion hole comprising the side chain of a second conserved histidine and the main-chain NH of the nucleophilic serine residue. In both hiGlpG and ecGlpG structures, a water molecule occupies this oxyanion hole.",2007,"M Joanne Lemieux, Sarah J Fischer, Maia M Cherney, Michael N G James, Katherine S Bateman"
"The Drosophila inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) DIAP2 is dispensable for cell survival, required for the innate immune response to gram-negative bacterial infection, and can be negatively regulated by the reaper/hid/grim family of IAP-binding apoptosis inducers",17068333,10.1074/jbc.M608051200,"Many inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) family proteins inhibit apoptosis. IAPs contain N-terminal baculovirus IAP repeat domains and a C-terminal RING ubiquitin ligase domain. Drosophila IAP DIAP1 is essential for the survival of many cells, protecting them from apoptosis by inhibiting active caspases. Apoptosis initiates when proteins such as Reaper, Hid, and Grim bind a surface groove in DIAP1 baculovirus IAP repeat domains via an N-terminal IAP-binding motif. This evolutionarily conserved interaction disrupts DIAP1-caspase interactions, unleashing apoptosis-inducing caspase activity. A second Drosophila IAP, DIAP2, also binds Rpr and Hid and inhibits apoptosis in multiple contexts when overexpressed. However, due to a lack of mutants, little is known about the normal functions of DIAP2. We report the generation of diap2 null mutants. These flies are viable and show no defects in developmental or stress-induced apoptosis. Instead, DIAP2 is required for the innate immune response to Gram-negative bacterial infection. DIAP2 promotes cytoplasmic cleavage and nuclear translocation of the NF-kappaB homolog Relish, and this requires the DIAP2 RING domain. Increasing the genetic dose of diap2 results in an increased immune response, whereas expression of Rpr or Hid results in down-regulation of DIAP2 protein levels. Together these observations suggest that DIAP2 can regulate immune signaling in a dose-dependent manner, and this can be regulated by IBM-containing proteins. Therefore, diap2 may identify a point of convergence between apoptosis and immune signaling pathways.",2007,"Chun Hong Chen, Jin Mo Park, Soon Ji Yoo, Bruce A Hay, Israel Muro, Ian Foe, Ming Guo, Jae Hong Seol, Jun R Huh"

Specialized OSNs detect this gas and relay the information to a dedicated circuit in the brain. Prolonged exposure to CO2 induced a reversible volume increase in the CO2-specific glomerulus. OSNs showed neither altered morphology nor function after chronic exposure, but one class of inhibitory local interneurons showed significantly increased responses to CO2. Two-photon imaging of the axon terminals of a single PN innervating the CO2 glomerulus showed significantly decreased functional output following CO2 exposure. Behavioral responses to CO2 were also reduced after such exposure.

Cumulative contributions of weak DNA determinants to targeting the Drosophila dosage compensation complex,17483514,10.1093/nar/gkm282,"Fine-tuning of X chromosomal gene expression in Drosophila melanogaster involves the selective interaction of the Dosage Compensation Complex (DCC) with the male X chromosome, in order to increase the transcription of many genes.

By adapting a 'one-hybrid' assay, we identified minimal DNA elements that direct the interaction of the key DCC subunit, MSL2, in cells. Strikingly, several such novel MSL2 recruitment modules have very different DNA sequences. The assay revealed a novel, 40 bp DNA element that is necessary for recruitment of DCC to an autosomal binding site in flies in the context of a longer sequence and sufficient by itself to direct recruitment if trimerized. Accordingly, recruitment of MSL2 to the single 40 bp element in cells was weak, but as a trimer approached the power of the strongest DCC recruitment site known to date, the roX1 DH site. This element is the shortest MSL2 recruitment sequence known to date.

Moonlight shifts the endogenous clock of Drosophila melanogaster,17307880,10.1073/pnas.0606870104,"The ability to be synchronized by light-dark cycles is a fundamental property of circadian clocks. Although there are indications that circadian clocks are extremely light-sensitive and that they can be set by the low irradiances that occur at dawn and dusk, this has not been shown on the cellular level. Here, we demonstrate that a subset of Drosophila's pacemaker neurons responds to nocturnal dim light. At a nighttime illumination comparable to quarter-moonlight intensity, the flies increase activity levels and shift their typical morning and evening activity peaks into the night. In parallel, clock protein levels are reduced, and clock protein rhythms shift in opposed direction in subsets of the previously identified morning and evening pacemaker cells. No effect was observed on the peripheral clock in the eye. Our results demonstrate that the neurons driving rhythmic behavior are extremely light-sensitive and capable of shifting activity in response to the very low light intensities that regularly occur in nature. This sensitivity may be instrumental in adaptation to different photoperiods, as was proposed by the morning and evening oscillator model of Pittendrigh and Daan.

Evolution of cis-regulation of the proneural genes,14756340,,"The current state of knowledge concerning cis-regulatory sequences of the proneural genes of vertebrates and Drosophila is discussed. Many proneural genes have a complex modular arrangement of discrete enhancer elements. One unusual feature of these genes is that many distant enhancer elements, regulating expression in specific spatial locations, require input from previously synthesized protein from the proneural gene itself, in addition to other transcriptional activators. This is distinct from the auto-regulation, via E boxes in the promoter, that takes place in neural precursors. The selection of neural precursors from a field of cells expressing a proneural gene, is mediated by Notch signalling and requires up-regulation of proneural gene expression in the precursor concurrently with down-regulation in the surrounding cells. Although the way in which a single cell is selected remains unclear, a number of feedback loops have been uncovered that reinforce the choice. These are briefly surveyed. A specific regulatory element, the Sensory Organ Precursor element, that mediates selection of the precursors of the large sensory bristles, has been described in Drosophila. We report the conservation of this sequence in Calliphora vicina, a higher fly. In contrast, no such sequence is seen in the achaete-scute complex of Anopheles gambiae, a basal Dipteran species.

Experience-dependent strengthening of Drosophila neuromuscular junctions,12878696,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.23-16-06546.2003,"The genetic analysis of larval neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) of Drosophila has provided detailed insights into molecular mechanisms that control the morphological and physiological development of these glutamatergic synapses. However, because of the chronic defects caused by mutations, a time-resolved analysis of these mechanisms and their functional relationships has been difficult so far. In this study we provide a first temporal map of some of the molecular and cellular key processes, which are triggered in wild-type animals by natural larval locomotor activity and then mediate experience-dependent strengthening of larval NMJs. Larval locomotor activity was increased either by chronically rearing a larval culture at 29 degrees C instead of 18 or 25 degrees C or by acutely transferring larvae from a culture vial onto agar plates. Within 2 hr of enhanced locomotor activity, NMJs showed a significant potentiation of signal transmission that was rapidly reversed by an induced paralysis of the temperature-sensitive mutant parats1. Enhanced locomotor activity was also associated with a significant increase in the number of large subsynaptic translation aggregates. After 4 hr, postsynaptic DGluR-IIA glutamate receptor subunits started to transiently accumulate in ring-shaped areas around synapses, and they condensed later on, after chronic locomotor stimulation at 29 degrees C, into typical postsynaptic patches. These NMJs showed a reduced perisynaptic expression of the cell adhesion molecule Fasciclin II, an increased number of junctional boutons, and significantly more active zones. Such temporal mapping of experience-dependent adaptations at developing wild-type and mutant NMJs will provide detailed insights into the dynamic control of glutamatergic signal transmission.",2003,"Christoph M Schuster, Joern R Steinert, Dierk F Reiff, Philippe R Thiel, Stephan J Sigrist"
Calcium-regulated GTPase activity in the calcium-binding protein calexcitin,12892754,10.1016/s1096-4959(03)00144-1,"Calexcitin (CE) is a calcium-binding protein, closely related to sarcoplasmic calcium-binding proteins, that is involved in invertebrate learning and memory. Early reports indicated that both Hermissenda and squid CE also could bind GTP; however, the biochemical significance of GTP-binding and its relationship to calcium binding have remained unclear. Here, we report that the GTPase activity of CE is strongly regulated by calcium. CE possessed a P-loop-like structure near the C-terminal similar to the phosphate-binding regions in other GTP-binding proteins. Site-directed mutagenesis of this region showed that Gly(182), Phe(186) and Gly(187) are required for maximum affinity, suggesting that the GTP-binding motif is G-N-x-x-[FM]-G. CE cloned from Drosophila CNS possessed a similar C-terminal sequence and also bound and hydrolyzed GTP. GTPase activity in Drosophila CE was also strongly regulated by Ca(2+), exhibiting over 23-fold higher activity in the presence of 0.3 microM calcium. Analysis of the conserved protein motifs defines a new family of Ca(2+)-binding proteins representing the first example of proteins endowed with both EF-hand calcium binding domains and a C-terminal, P-loop-like GTP-binding motif. These results establish that, in the absence of calcium, both squid and Drosophila CE bind GTP at near-physiological concentrations and hydrolyze GTP at rates comparable to unactivated ras. Calcium functions to increase GTP-binding and GTPase activity in CE, similar to the effect of GTPase activating proteins in other low-MW GTP-binding proteins.

Here we describe the identification of the Drosophila melanogaster dysfusion gene, which encodes a novel basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)-PAS protein conserved between Caenorhabditis elegans, insects, and humans, and controls tracheal fusion events. The Dysfusion protein functions as a heterodimer with the Tango bHLH-PAS protein in vivo to form a putative DNA-binding complex. The dysfusion gene is expressed in a variety of embryonic cell types, including tracheal-fusion, leading-edge, foregut atrium cells, nervous system, hindgut, and anal pad cells. RNAi experiments indicate that dysfusion is required for dorsal branch, lateral trunk, and ganglionic branch fusion but not for fusion of the dorsal trunk. The escargot gene, which is also expressed in fusion cells and is required for tracheal fusion, precedes dysfusion expression. Analysis of escargot mutants indicates a complex pattern of dysfusion regulation, such that dysfusion expression is dependent on escargot in the dorsal and ganglionic branches but not the dorsal trunk. Early in tracheal development, the Trachealess bHLH-PAS protein is present at uniformly high levels in all tracheal cells, but since the levels of Dysfusion rise in wild-type fusion cells, the levels of Trachealess in fusion cells decline. The downregulation of Trachealess is dependent on dysfusion function. These results suggest the possibility that competitive interactions between basic helix-loop-helix-PAS proteins (Dysfusion, Trachealess, and possibly Similar) may be important for the proper development of the trachea.",2003,"Stephen T Crews, Lan Jiang"
Circadian clock genes in Drosophila: recent developments,15248475,,"Circadian rhythms provide a temporal framework to living organisms and are established in a majority of eukaryotes and in a few prokaryotes. The molecular mechanisms of circadian clock is constantly being investigated in Drosophila melanogaster. The core of the clock mechanism was described by a transcription-translation feedback loop model involving period (per), timeless (tim), dclock and cycle genes. However, recent research has identified multiple feedback loops controlling rhythm generation and expression. Novel mutations of timeless throw more light on the functions of per and tim products. Analysis of pdf neuropeptide gene (expressed in circadian pacemaker cells in Drosophila), indicate that PDF acts as the principal circadian transmitter and is involved in output pathways. The product of cryptochrome is known to function as a circadian photoreceptor as well as component of the circadian clock. This review focuses on the recent progress in the field of molecular rhythm research in the fruit fly. The gene(s) and the gene product(s) that are involved in the transmission of environmental information to the clock, as well as the timing signals from the clock outward to cellular functions are remain to be determined.",2003,"P Subramanian, E Balamurugan, G Suthakar"
Discovery of genes with highly restricted expression patterns in the Drosophila wing disc using DNA oligonucleotide microarrays,12505997,10.1242/dev.00293,"The Drosophila wing disc is divided along the proximal-distal axis into regions giving rise to the body wall (proximal), wing hinge (central) and wing blade (distal). We applied DNA microarray analysis to discover genes with potential roles in the development of these regions. We identified a set of 94 transcripts enriched (two fold or greater) in the body wall and 56 transcripts enriched in the wing/hinge region. Transcripts that are known to have highly restricted expression patterns, such as pannier, twist and Bar-H1 (body wall) and knot, nubbin and Distal-less (wing/hinge), showed strong differential expression on the arrays. In situ hybridization for 50 previously uncharacterized genes similarly revealed that transcript enrichment identified by the array analysis was consistent with the observed spatial expression. There was a broad spectrum of patterns, in some cases suggesting that the genes could be targets of known signaling pathways. We show that three of these genes respond to wingless signaling. We also discovered genes likely to play specific roles in tracheal and myoblast cell types, as these cells are part of the body wall fragment. In summary, the identification of genes with restricted expression patterns using whole genome profiling suggests that many genes with potential roles in wing disc development remain to be characterized.",2003,"Michael G Jarman, J Robert S Whittle, Roger Phillips, Thomas L Jacobsen, Michael Hubank, Donna M Cain, Amanda Simcox, Miranda J Butler"
Mammalian Lgl forms a protein complex with PAR-6 and aPKC independently of PAR-3 to regulate epithelial cell polarity,12725730,10.1016/s0960-9822(03)00244-6,"Background: Epithelial cells have apicobasal polarity and an asymmetric junctional complex that provides the bases for development and tissue maintenance. In both vertebrates and invertebrates, the evolutionarily conserved protein complex, PAR-6/aPKC/PAR-3, localizes to the subapical region and plays critical roles in the establishment of a junctional complex and cell polarity. In Drosophila, another set of proteins called tumor suppressors, such as Lgl, which localize separately to the basolateral membrane domain but genetically interact with the subapical proteins, also contribute to the establishment of cell polarity. However, how physically separated proteins interact remains to be clarified. Results: We show that mammalian Lgl competes for PAR-3 in forming an independent complex with PAR-6/aPKC. During cell polarization, mLgl initially colocalizes with PAR-6/aPKC at the cell-cell contact region and is phosphorylated by aPKC, followed by segregation from apical PAR-6/aPKC to the basolateral membrane after cells are polarized. Overexpression studies establish that increased amounts of the mLgl/PAR-6/aPKC complex suppress the formation of epithelial junctions; this contrasts with the previous observation that the complex containing PAR-3 promotes it. Conclusions: These results indicate that PAR-6/aPKC selectively interacts with either mLgl or PAR-3 under the control of aPKC activity to regulate epithelial cell polarity.",2003,"Tomonori Hirose, Akihiro Iwamatsu, Chikako Ishiyama, Yosuke Horikoshi, Tomoyuki Yamanaka, Yuki Sugiyama, Azusa Shinohara, Atsushi Suzuki, Shigeo Ohno"
"Metastatic lymph node 64 (MLN64), a gene overexpressed in breast cancers, is regulated by Sp/KLF transcription factors",12802284,10.1038/sj.onc.1206500,"MLN64, is invariably coamplified and coexpressed with erbB-2 in breast cancers. The human MLN64 and ERBB2 genes are positioned at less than 50 kb from each other, on chromosome 17q12. To understand the molecular basis of MLN64 overexpression in cancer, the genomic region containing the MLN64 and ERBB2 genes was isolated and mapped. The two genes, DARPP32 and Telethonin, flanking MLN64 respectively on its centromeric and telomeric sides, although coamplified, are not overexpressed in breast cancer cells, indicating that gene amplification is not sufficient to allow overexpression. The MLN64 minimal promoter was isolated and found to be a housekeeping gene promoter containing four potential Sp1 binding elements. Using Sp1-deficient Drosophila SL2 cells, MLN64 promoter activity was induced in a dose-dependent manner by exogenous Sp1 addition. Furthermore, mutation of each individual Sp1 element resulted in a significant decrease in reporter gene activity, indicating that all the Sp1 binding elements are functional and act together to promote gene expression. Since the ERBB2 promoter is also positively regulated by Sp1, this study indicates that MLN64 and ERBB2 genes share common transcriptional controls together with a physical link on chromosome 17q. We speculate that, in addition to the oncogenic potential of erbB-2 overexpression, the unbalanced action of MLN64 contributes to the poor clinical outcome of breast tumors bearing this amplified region.",2003,"Fabien Alpy, Catherine Tomasetto, Marie-Christine Rio, Kumari L Andarawewa, Sébastien Degot, Anne Boulay, Isabelle Stoll, Christel Moog-Lutz"

To determine the genetic divergence of these three species, sequence data were analyzed using maximum parsimony and population aggregation analysis. Individual and combined gene genealogies indicate that D. arizonae and D. mojavensis are neither diagnosable nor monophyletic with respect to one another. Although D. navojoa has differentiated from D. arizonae and D. mojavensis, as diagnosed by nuclear gene sequences, it may have undergone a reticulation event with D. arizonae.

Disruption of scribble (Scrb1) causes severe neural tube defects in the circletail mouse,12499390,10.1093/hmg/ddg014,"Circletail is one of only two mouse mutants that exhibit the most severe form of neural tube defect (NTD), termed craniorachischisis. In this disorder, almost the entire brain and spinal cord is affected, owing to a failure to initiate neural tube closure. Craniorachischisis is a significant cause of lethality in humans, yet the molecular mechanisms involved remain poorly understood. Here, we report the identification of the gene mutated in circletail (Crc), using a positional cloning approach. This gene, Scrb1, encodes a member of the LAP protein family related to Drosophila scribble, with 16 leucine rich repeats and four PDZ domains. The Crc mutant contains a single base insertion that creates a frame shift and leads to premature termination of the Scrb1 protein. We report the expression pattern of Scrb1 during embryonic and fetal development, and show that Scrb1 expression closely mirrors the phenotypic defects observed in Crc/Crc mutants. In addition, circletail genetically interacts with the loop-tail mutant, and we reveal overlapping expression of Scrb1 with Vangl2, the gene mutated in loop-tail. The identification of the Crc gene further defines the nature of the genetic pathway required for the initiation of neural tube closure and provides an important new candidate that may be implicated in the aetiology of human NTDs.",2003,"Andrew J Copp, Caroline Paternotte, Helen M Phillips, Jennifer N Murdoch, Philip Stanier, Ruth Arkell, Deborah J Henderson, Carles Gaston-Massuet, Kit Doudney"

The analysis of different mechanisms involved in the regulation of the three identified Sxl target genes (Sex-lethal itself, transformer, and male specific lethal-2) has contributed to a better understanding of translation repression, as well as constitutive and alternative splicing.

The disturbance was somewhat similar to that observed in interspecific hybrids. Quantitative analysis showed that the mean frequency of nuclei with defective chromosome pairing ranged from 60.4 to 76%. FISH analysis of ovarian nurse chromosomes of Canton S x Berlin hybrids showed differences in the label localization in asynaptic homologs of arm 2L, which probably results in disrupted homolog pairing and reveal interlinear differences in localization of mobile genetic elements.

A deficiency screen of the major autosomes identifies a gene (matrimony) that is haplo-insufficient for achiasmate segregation in Drosophila oocytes,14573476,,"In Drosophila oocytes, euchromatic homolog-homolog associations are released at the end of pachytene, while heterochromatic pairings persist until metaphase I. A screen of 123 autosomal deficiencies for dominant effects on achiasmate chromosome segregation has identified a single gene that is haplo-insufficient for homologous achiasmate segregation and whose product may be required for the maintenance of such heterochromatic pairings. Of the deficiencies tested, only one exhibited a strong dominant effect on achiasmate segregation, inducing both X and fourth chromosome nondisjunction in FM7/X females. Five overlapping deficiencies showed a similar dominant effect on achiasmate chromosome disjunction and mapped the haplo-insufficient meiotic gene to a small interval within 66C7-12. A P-element insertion mutation in this interval exhibits a similar dominant effect on achiasmate segregation, inducing both high levels of X and fourth chromosome nondisjunction in FM7/X females and high levels of fourth chromosome nondisjunction in X/X females. The insertion site for this P element lies immediately upstream of CG18543, and germline expression of a UAS-CG18543 cDNA construct driven by nanos-GAL4 fully rescues the dominant meiotic defect. We conclude that CG18543 is the haplo-insufficient gene and have renamed this gene matrimony (mtrm). Cytological studies of prometaphase and metaphase I in mtrm hemizygotes demonstrate that achiasmate chromosomes are not properly positioned with respect to their homolog on the meiotic spindle. One possible, albeit speculative, interpretation of these data is that the presence of only a single copy of mtrm disrupts the function of whatever ""glue"" holds heterochromatically paired homologs together from the end of pachytene until metaphase I.",2003,"Michael J Palladino, Mia Champion, Charisse Orme, Jeanette Natzle, R Scott Hawley, Luria Namba, David Harris, Joseph Kramer"
Microarray analysis of cytochrome P450 mediated insecticide resistance in Drosophila,12826097,10.1016/s0965-1748(03)00064-x,"Insecticide resistance in laboratory selected Drosophila strains has been associated with upregulation of a range of different cytochrome P450s, however in recent field isolates of D. melanogaster resistance to DDT and other compounds is conferred by one P450 gene, Cyp6g1. Using microarray analysis of all Drosophila P450 genes, here we show that different P450 genes such as Cyp12d1 and Cyp6a8 can also be selected using DDT in the laboratory. We also show, however, that a homolog of Cyp6g1 is over-expressed in a field resistant strain of D. simulans. In order to determine why Cyp6g1 is so widely selected in the field we examine the pattern of cross-resistance of both resistant strains and transgenic flies over-expressing Cyp6g1 alone. We show that all three DDT selected P450s can confer resistance to the neonicotinoid imidacloprid but that Cyp6a8 confers no cross-resistance to malathion. Transgenic flies over-expressing Cyp6g1 also show cross-resistance to other neonicotinoids such as acetamiprid and nitenpyram. We suggest that the broad level of cross-resistance shown by Cyp6g1 may have facilitated its selection as a resistance gene in natural Drosophila populations.",2003,"G Le Goff, L Sofer, S Boundy, L Madi-Ravazzi, J L Yen, R H ffrench-Constant, P J Daborn, R Lind, C Sabourault"
The Drosophila embryonic patterning determinant torsolike is a component of the eggshell,12814553,10.1016/s0960-9822(03)00379-8,"The development of the head and tail regions of the Drosophila embryo is dependent upon the localized polar activation of Torso (Tor), a receptor tyrosine kinase that is uniformly distributed in the membrane of the developing embryo. Trunk (Trk), the proposed ligand for Tor, is secreted as an inactive precursor into the perivitelline fluid that lies between the embryonic membrane and the vitelline membrane (VM), the inner layer of the eggshell. The spatial regulation of Trk processing is thought to be mediated by the secreted product of the torsolike (tsl) gene, which is expressed during oogenesis by a specialized population of follicle cells present at the two ends of the oocyte. We show here that Tsl protein is specifically localized to the polar regions of the VM in laid eggs. We further demonstrate that although Tsl can associate with nonpolar regions of the VM, the activity of polar-localized Tsl is enhanced, suggesting the existence of another spatially restricted factor acting in this pathway. The incorporation of Tsl into the VM provides a mechanism for the transfer of spatial information from the follicle cells to the developing embryo.

A function for Egf receptor signaling in expanding the developing brain in Drosophila,12646129,10.1016/s0960-9822(03)00094-0,"Background: In invertebrates and vertebrates, neural midline cells secrete signals that pattern the central nervous system (CNS). However, an important part of the developing insect brain, involved in functions such as olfaction and feeding behavior, is positioned lateral to the foregut and lacks neural cells at the midline. Could the foregut substitute for neural midline cells and secrete signals that pattern this part of the brain? Results: In Drosophila embryos, the neural midline marker Single-minded is expressed in foregut cells adjacent to the brain, as are members of the Egf receptor signaling pathway. Removing the function of these molecules results in aberrant proliferation and reduced size in the brain lateral to the foregut. Conclusions: Cells of the brain lateral to the foregut receive an Egf signal from the midline and proliferate in response. A likely source of this signal is the foregut. These findings raise the possibility that the brain lateral to the foregut is an evolutionarily recent addition to the arthropod brain, and that the anterior boundary of the brain neural midline is a conserved feature in bilaterally symmetric animals.",2003,Damon T Page
Gene transcription of fgl2 in endothelial cells is controlled by Ets-1 and Oct-1 and requires the presence of both Sp1 and Sp3,12752447,10.1046/j.1432-1033.2003.03595.x,"The immune coagulant fgl2/fibroleukin has been previously shown to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of murine and human fulminant hepatitis and fetal loss syndrome. Constitutive expression of fgl2 transcripts at low levels are seen in cytotoxic T cells, endothelial, intestinal and trophoblast cells, while specific factors (such as virus and cytokines) are required to induce high levels of fgl2 expression in other cell types including monocytes/macrophages. To address the transcriptional mechanisms that regulate constitutive expression of fgl2, murine genomic clones were characterized and the transcription start site was defined by 5'-RACE and primer extension. A comprehensive assessment of basal fgl2 promoter activity in murine vascular endothelial cells defined a minimal 119 bp region responsible for constitutive fgl2 transcription. A complex positive regulatory domain (PRD) spanning a 39-bp sequence from -87 to -49 (relative to the transcription start site) was identified. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay studies in vascular endothelial cells revealed that the nucleoprotein complexes that form on this positive regulatory domain (PRD) contain Sp1/Sp3 family members, Oct-1, and Ets-1. Heterologous expression studies in Drosophila Schneider cells confirmed that the constitutive expression of this gene is controlled by Ets-1 and requires the presence both of the Sp1 and Sp3 transcription factors. The presence of this complex multicomponent PRD in the fgl2 proximal promoter is consistent with the observation that, in vivo, fgl2 expression is tightly regulated. Moreover, viral induced fgl2 expression also requires the presence of this PRD. These results clearly demonstrate that multiple cis DNA elements in a clustered region work cooperatively to regulate constitutive fgl2 expression and interact with inducible elements to regulate viral-induced fgl2 expression in endothelial cells.",2003,"Gary A Levy, David A Clark, Julian L Leibowitz, Michael Mendicino, Jin Wen Ding, Mingfeng Liu, Laisum Fung, Cheryl D'Abreo, Qin Ning, Philip A Marsden"
Direct interaction of two polarity complexes implicated in epithelial tight junction assembly,12545177,10.1038/ncb923,"Tight junctions help establish polarity in mammalian epithelia by forming a physical barrier that separates apical and basolateral membranes. Two evolutionarily conserved multi-protein complexes, Crumbs (Crb)-PALS1 (Stardust)-PATJ (DiscsLost) and Cdc42-Par6-Par3-atypical protein kinase C (aPKC), have been implicated in the assembly of tight junctions and in polarization of Drosophila melanogaster epithelia. Here we identify a biochemical and functional link between these two complexes that is mediated by Par6 and PALS1 (proteins associated with Lin7). The interaction between Par6 and PALS1 is direct, requires the amino terminus of PALS1 and the PDZ domain of Par6, and is regulated by Cdc42-GTP. The transmembrane protein Crb can recruit wild-type Par6, but not Par6 with a mutated PDZ domain, to the cell surface. Expression of dominant-negative PALS1-associated tight junction protein (PATJ) in MDCK cells results in mis-localization of PALS1, members of the Par3-Par6-aPKC complex and the tight junction marker, ZO-1. Similarly, overexpression of Par6 in MDCK cells inhibits localization of PALS1 to the tight junction.

In crosses with D. virilis females, X chromosomal (or maternal) factors masked variation in pulse length despite variation in heterospecific autosomal song genes. To the contrary, in crosses with D. flavomontana females, X chromosomal genes largely determined the pause length and interacted with autosomal genes to determine the pulse length.

Fidelity in planar cell polarity signalling,12540853,10.1038/nature01366,"The polarity of Drosophila wing hairs displays remarkable fidelity. Each of the approximately 30,000 wing epithelial cells constructs an actin-rich prehair that protrudes from its distal vertex and points distally. The distal location and orientation of the hairs is virtually error free, thus forming a nearly perfect parallel array. This process is controlled by the planar cell polarity signalling pathway. Here we show that interaction between two tiers of the planar cell polarity signalling mechanism results in the observed high fidelity. The first tier, mediated by the cadherin Fat, dictates global orientation by transducing a directional signal to individual cells. The second tier, orchestrated by the 7-pass transmembrane receptor Frizzled, aligns each cell's polarity with that of its neighbours through the action of an intercellular feedback loop, enabling polarity to propagate from cell to cell. We show that all cells need not respond correctly to the presumably subtle signal transmitted by Fat. Subsequent action of the Frizzled feedback loop is sufficient to align all the cells cooperatively. This economical system is therefore highly robust, and produces virtually error-free arrays.",2003,"Helen McNeill, Michael A Simon, Dali Ma, Chung-hui Yang, Jeffrey D Axelrod"
Absence of transitive and systemic pathways allows cell-specific and isoform-specific RNAi in Drosophila,12592004,10.1261/rna.2154103,"RNA interference (RNAi) designates the multistep process by which double-stranded RNA induces the silencing of homologous endogenous genes. Some aspects of RNAi appear to be conserved throughout evolution, including the processing of trigger dsRNAs into small 21-23-bp siRNAs and their use to guide the degradation of complementary mRNAs. Two remarkable features of RNAi were uncovered in plants and Caenorhabditid elegans. First, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activities allow the synthesis of siRNA complementary to sequences upstream of or downstream from the initial trigger region in the target mRNA, leading to a transitive RNAi with sequences that had not been initially targeted. Secondly, systemic RNAi may cause the targeting of gene silencing in one tissue to spread to other tissues. Using transgenes expressing dsRNA, we investigated whether transitive and systemic RNAi occur in Drosophila. DsRNA-producing transgenes targeted RNAi to specific regions of alternative mRNA species of one gene without transitive effect directed to sequences downstream from or upstream of the initial trigger region. Moreover, specific expression of a dsRNA, using either cell-specific GAL4 drivers or random clonal activation of a GAL4 driver, mediated a cell-autonomous RNAi. Together, our results provide evidence that transitive and systemic aspects of RNAi are not conserved in Drosophila and demonstrate that dsRNA-producing transgenes allow powerful reverse genetic approaches to be conducted in this model organism, by knocking down gene functions at the resolution of a single-cell type and of a single isoform.",2003,"Clément Carré, Jean-Antoine Lepesant, Dimitri Szymczak, Jean-Yves Roignant, Christophe Antoniewski, Bruno Mugat"

This copy contains identical LTRs, indicating that the insertion is a recent event. By contrast, the euchromatic part of the D. melanogaster genome contains only profoundly damaged GATE copies or fragments of the transposon. The preferential localization of GATE sequences in heterochromatin was confirmed for the other species in the melanogaster subgroup.

There was significant variation among substituted lines; lines possessing the third chromosome from the resistant line, which confers resistance to the three organophosphates, generally showed lower mean values of these fitness measures. Chromosomal analyses also indicated significant negative contributions of the third chromosome from the resistant line. However, significant positive contributions of the interactions among chromosomes from the resistant line to these fitness measures were also detected. We further conducted a local stability analysis, in which each chromosome-substituted line was assumed to be introduced at a low frequency into the initial susceptible population. It was demonstrated that the resistance factor(s) on the third chromosome tend to decrease in their frequency under both density-independent and juvenile density-regulated conditions. Based on these results, a possible explanation for the seasonal fluctuations in resistance to the three organophosphates observed in the natural population was proposed.",2003,"Brian Charlesworth, Takahiro Miyo, Yuzuru Oguma"
Pygo2 associates with MLL2 histone methyltransferase and GCN5 histone acetyltransferase complexes to augment Wnt target gene expression and breast cancer stem-like cell expansion,20937768,10.1128/MCB.00465-10,"Resent studies have identified Pygopus as a core component of the β-catenin/T-cell factor (TCF)/lymphoid-enhancing factor 1 (LEF) transcriptional activation complex required for the expression of canonical Wg/Wnt target genes in Drosophila.

In this study, we perform a series of molecular/biochemical experiments to demonstrate that Pygo2 associates with histone-modifying enzymatic complexes, specifically the MLL2 histone methyltransferase (HMT) and STAGA histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complexes, to facilitate their interaction with β-catenin and to augment Wnt1-induced, TCF/LEF-dependent transcriptional activation in breast cancer cells.

The Dachshund gene in development and hormone-responsive tumorigenesis,19896866,10.1016/j.tem.2009.08.002,"The dachshund (dac) gene was initially described as a mutant phenotype in flies featuring extremely short legs relative to their body length. Functioning as a dominant suppressor of the ellipse mutation, a hypermorphic allele of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), the dac gene plays a key role in metazoan development, regulating ocular, limb, brain, and gonadal development. In the Drosophila eye, dac is a key component of the Retinal Determination Gene Network (RDGN) governing the normal initiation of the morphogenetic furrow and thereby eye development. Recent studies have demonstrated an important role for human Dachshund homologue (DACH1) in tumorigenesis, in particular, breast, prostate and ovarian cancer.

A comprehensive survey of 3' animal miRNA modification events and a possible role for 3' adenylation in modulating miRNA targeting effectiveness,20719920,10.1101/gr.106054.110,"Animal microRNA sequences are subject to 3' nucleotide addition. Through detailed analysis of deep-sequenced short RNA data sets, we show adenylation and uridylation of miRNA is globally present and conserved across Drosophila and vertebrates. To better understand 3' adenylation function, we deep-sequenced RNA after knockdown of nucleotidyltransferase enzymes. The PAPD4 nucleotidyltransferase adenylates a wide range of miRNA loci, but adenylation does not appear to affect miRNA stability on a genome-wide scale. Adenine addition appears to reduce effectiveness of miRNA targeting of mRNA transcripts while deep-sequencing of RNA bound to immunoprecipitated Argonaute (AGO) subfamily proteins EIF2C1-EIF2C3 revealed substantial reduction of adenine addition in miRNA associated with EIF2C2 and EIF2C3. Our findings show 3' addition events are widespread and conserved across animals, PAPD4 is a primary miRNA adenylating enzyme, and suggest a role for 3' adenine addition in modulating miRNA effectiveness, possibly through interfering with incorporation into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), a regulatory role that would complement the role of miRNA uridylation in blocking DICER1 uptake.",2010,"Michiel J L de Hoon, Taku Funakoshi, Yoshinari Ando, Yasuhiro Tomaru, Yoshihide Hayashizaki, A Maxwell Burroughs, Tsutomu Kurokawa, Carsten O Daub, Harukazu Suzuki, Ryo Ukekawa, Takahiro Nishibu"
Regulation of axonal development by the nuclear protein hindsight (pebbled) in the Drosophila visual system,20541542,10.1016/j.ydbio.2010.06.007,"The molecules and networks involved in the process of acquisition and maintenance of the form of a mature neuron are not completely known. Using a misexpression screen we identified the gene hindsight as a gene involved in the process of acquisition of the neuronal morphogenesis in the Drosophila adult nervous system. hindsight encodes a transcription factor known for its role in early developmental processes such as embryonic germ band retraction and dorsal closure, as well as in the establishment of cell morphology, planar cell polarity, and epithelial integrity during retinal development. We describe here a novel function for HNT by showing that both loss and gain of function of HNT affects the pathfinding of the photoreceptors axons. By manipulating the timing and level of HNT expression, together with the number of cells manipulated we show here that the function of HNT in axonal guidance is independent of the HNT functions previously reported in retinal cells. Based on genetic interaction experiments we show that part of HNT function in axonal development is exerted through the regulation of genes involved in the dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton.",2010,"Jimena Sierralta, Carlos Oliva"
An unbiased sensitivity analysis reveals important parameters controlling periodicity of circadian clock,19777582,10.1002/bit.22540,"To assess the importance of model parameters in kinetic models, sensitivity analysis is generally employed to provide key measures. However, it is quite often that no information is available for a significant number of parameters in biochemical models. Therefore, the results of sensitivity analysis that heavily rely on the accuracy of parameters are largely ambiguous. In this study, we propose a computational approach to determine the relative importance of parameters controlling the performance of the circadian clock in Drosophila. While previous attempts to sensitivity analysis largely depend on the knowledge of model parameters which are generally unknown, our study depicts a consistent picture of sensitivity assessment for a large number of parameters, even when the values of these parameters are not available in vivo. The resulting parametric sensitivity analysis suggests that PER/TIM negative loop is critical to maintain the stable periodicity of the circadian clock, which is consistent to the previously experimental and computational findings. Furthermore, our analysis generates a rich hypothesis of important parameters in the circadian clock that can be further tested experimentally. This approach can also be extended to assess the sensitivity of parameters in any biochemical system where a large number of parameters have unknown values.",2010,"Don Kulasiri, Zhi Xie, Jiang Qian, Sandhya Samarasinghe"
DIP2 disco-interacting protein 2 homolog A (Drosophila) is a candidate receptor for follistatin-related protein/follistatin-like 1--analysis of their binding with TGF-β superfamily proteins,20860622,10.1111/j.1742-4658.2010.07816.x,"Follistatin-related protein (FRP)/follistatin-like 1 (FSTL1) is a member of the follistatin protein family, all of which share a characteristic structure unit found in follistatin, called the FS domain. Developmental studies have suggested that FRP regulates organ tissue formation in embryos. Immunological studies showed that FRP modifies joint inflammation in arthritic disease, and modulates allograft tolerance. However, the principle physiological function of FRP is currently unknown. To address this issue, we cloned four FRP-associated proteins using a two-hybrid cloning method: disco-interacting protein 2 homolog A from Drosophila (DIP2A), CD14, glypican 1 and titin. Only DIP2A was expected to be a membrane receptor protein with intracellular regions. Over-expression of FLAG epitope-tagged DIP2A augmented the suppressive effect of FRP on FBJ murine osteosarcoma viral oncogene homolog (FOS) expression, and the Fab fragment of IgG to FLAG blocked this effect. Knockdown of Dip2a leaded to Fos gene up-regulation, and this was not affected by exogenous FRP. These in vitro experiments confirmed that DIP2A could be a cell-surface receptor protein and mediate a FOS down-regulation signal of FRP. Moreover, molecular interaction analyses using Biacore demonstrated that FRP bound to DIP2A and CD14, and also with proteins of the TGF-β superfamily, i.e. activin, TGF-β, bone morphogenetic protein 2/4 (BMP-2/4), their receptors and follistatin. FRP binding to DIP2A was blocked by CD14, follistatin, activin and BMP-2. FRP blocked the ligand-receptor binding of activin and BMP-2, but integrated itself with that of BMP-4.

Regeneration of the variance of metric traits by spontaneous mutation in a Drosophila population,20515513,10.1017/S001667231000011X,"In the C1 population of Drosophila melanogaster of moderate effective size ( approximately 500), which was genetically invariant in its origin, we studied the regeneration by spontaneous mutation of the genetic variance for two metric traits [abdominal (AB) and sternopleural (ST) bristle number] and that of the concealed mutation load for viability, together with their temporal stability, using alternative selection models based on mutational parameters estimated in the C1 genetic background. During generations 381-485 of mutation accumulation (MA), the additive variances of AB and ST approached the levels observed in standing laboratory populations, fluctuating around their expected equilibrium values under neutrality or under relatively weak causal stabilizing selection. This type of selection was required to simultaneously account for the observed additive variance in our population and for those previously reported in natural and laboratory populations, indicating that most mutations affecting bristle traits would only be subjected to weak selective constraints. Although gene action for bristles was essentially additive, transient situations occurred where inbreeding resulted in a depression of the mean and an increase of the additive variance. This was ascribed to the occasional segregation of mutations of large recessive effects. On the other hand, the observed non-lethal inbreeding depression for viability must be explained by the segregation of alleles of considerable and largely recessive deleterious effects, and the corresponding load concealed in the heterozygous condition was found to be temporally stable, as expected from tighter constraints imposed by natural selection.",2010,"Carlos López-Fanjul, Diego Bersabé, Aurora García-Dorado, Carmen Amador"
Rapid cold-hardening in Zaprionus vittiger (Coquillett) (Diptera: Drosophilidae),21410019,,"Low temperature injury can be significantly reduced by pre-treatment at sub-lethal low temperatures of only a few hours--a phenomenon termed 'rapid cold-hardening' (RCH). However, most studies to date have focused extensively on only a few key insect taxa, e.g. Drosophila melanogaster within the Drosophilidae family. Further studies on other closely-related species are required to better understand evolutionary and ecological variation in the magnitude of the RCH response in terrestrial arthropods. Here, we investigated RCH in a previously unstudied fruit fly, Zaprionus vittiger, following a range of high and low pretreatment temperatures. There was a significant improvement in Z. vittiger survival of lethal temperatures (2 h at -3 degrees C) following a 2 h pretreatment at 4, 7 and 10 degrees C as well as 30 degrees C for 2 h. Maximum survival (60-70%) during RCH was achieved following hardening at 7 degrees C and 10 degrees C but is lower than some Drosophila species under similar treatment conditions. Therefore, since RCH was detected in a confamilial species, we propose that RCH might be a widely conserved response to temperature variation in the family Drosophilidae, although some variation in the magnitude of the response can be detected.",2010,"Casper Nyamukondiwa, John S Terblanche"
Using comparative genomic hybridization to survey genomic sequence divergence across species: a proof-of-concept from Drosophila,20429934,10.1186/1471-2164-11-271,"Background: Genome-wide analysis of sequence divergence among species offers profound insights into the evolutionary processes that shape lineages. When full-genome sequencing is not feasible for a broad comparative study, we propose the use of array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) in order to identify orthologous genes with high sequence divergence. Here we discuss experimental design, statistical power, success rate, sources of variation and potential confounding factors. We used a spotted PCR product microarray platform from Drosophila melanogaster to assess sequence divergence on a gene-by-gene basis in three fully sequenced heterologous species (D. sechellia, D. simulans, and D. yakuba). Because complete genome assemblies are available for these species this study presents a powerful test for the use of aCGH as a tool to measure sequence divergence. Results: We found a consistent and linear relationship between hybridization ratio and sequence divergence of the sample to the platform species. At higher levels of sequence divergence (< 92% sequence identity to D. melanogaster) approximately 84% of features had significantly less hybridization to the array in the heterologous species than the platform species, and thus could be identified as ""diverged"". At lower levels of divergence (>or= 97% identity), only 13% of genes were identified as diverged. While approximately 40% of the variation in hybridization ratio can be accounted for by variation in sequence identity of the heterologous sample relative to D. melanogaster, other individual characteristics of the DNA sequences, such as GC content, also contribute to variation in hybridization ratio, as does technical variation. Conclusions: Here we demonstrate that aCGH can accurately be used as a proxy to estimate genome-wide divergence, thus providing an efficient way to evaluate how evolutionary processes and genomic architecture can shape species diversity in non-model systems. Given the increased number of species for which microarray platforms are available, comparative studies can be conducted for many interesting lineages in order to identify highly diverged genes that may be the target of natural selection.",2010,"Kosha Soneji, Suzy C P Renn, Hans A Hofmann, Heather E Machado, Rob J Kulathinal, Albyn Jones"
Lipoprotein particles cross the blood-brain barrier in Drosophila,20685986,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5943-09.2010,"The blood-brain barrier (BBB) regulates passage of nutrients and signaling molecules from the circulation into the brain. Whether lipoproteins cross the BBB in vivo has been controversial, and no clear requirement for circulating lipoproteins in brain development has been shown. We address these issues in Drosophila, which has an functionally conserved BBB, and lipoproteins that resemble those of vertebrates. We show that the Drosophila lipoprotein lipophorin exists in two isoforms. Both isoforms cross the BBB, but accumulate on distinct subsets of cells within the brain. In addition to acting as a lipid carrier, lipophorin carries both sterol-linked and GPI-linked proteins into the circulation and transports them across the BBB. Finally, lipophorin promotes neuroblast proliferation by a mechanism that does not depend on delivery of dietary lipids. Transport of lipophorin and its cargo across the BBB represents a novel mechanism by which peripherally synthesized proteins might enter the brain and influence its development. Furthermore, lipid-linkage may be an efficient method to transport therapeutic molecules across the BBB.",2010,"Suzanne Eaton, Marko Brankatschk"
Generation of knockout rats with X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (X-SCID) using zinc-finger nucleases,20111598,10.1371/journal.pone.0008870,"Background: Although the rat is extensively used as a laboratory model, the inability to utilize germ line-competent rat embryonic stem (ES) cells has been a major drawback for studies that aim to elucidate gene functions. Recently, zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) were successfully used to create genome-specific double-stranded breaks and thereby induce targeted gene mutations in a wide variety of organisms including plants, drosophila, zebrafish, etc. Methodology/principal findings: We report here on ZFN-induced gene targeting of the rat interleukin 2 receptor gamma (Il2rg) locus, where orthologous human and mouse mutations cause X-linked severe combined immune deficiency (X-SCID). Co-injection of mRNAs encoding custom-designed ZFNs into the pronucleus of fertilized oocytes yielded genetically modified offspring at rates greater than 20%, which possessed a wide variety of deletion/insertion mutations. ZFN-modified founders faithfully transmitted their genetic changes to the next generation along with the severe combined immune deficiency phenotype.

A role for juvenile hormone in the prepupal development of Drosophila melanogaster,20181742,10.1242/dev.037218,"To elucidate the role of juvenile hormone (JH) in metamorphosis of Drosophila melanogaster, the corpora allata cells, which produce JH, were killed using the cell death gene grim. These allatectomized (CAX) larvae were smaller at pupariation and died at head eversion. They showed premature ecdysone receptor B1 (EcR-B1) in the photoreceptors and in the optic lobe, downregulation of proliferation in the optic lobe, and separation of R7 from R8 in the medulla during the prepupal period. All of these effects of allatectomy were reversed by feeding third instar larvae on a diet containing the JH mimic (JHM) pyriproxifen or by application of JH III or JHM at the onset of wandering. Eye and optic lobe development in the Methoprene-tolerant (Met)-null mutant mimicked that of CAX prepupae, but the mutant formed viable adults, which had marked abnormalities in the organization of their optic lobe neuropils. Feeding Met(27) larvae on the JHM diet did not rescue the premature EcR-B1 expression or the downregulation of proliferation but did partially rescue the premature separation of R7, suggesting that other pathways besides Met might be involved in mediating the response to JH. Selective expression of Met RNAi in the photoreceptors caused their premature expression of EcR-B1 and the separation of R7 and R8, but driving Met RNAi in lamina neurons led only to the precocious appearance of EcR-B1 in the lamina. Thus, the lack of JH and its receptor Met causes a heterochronic shift in the development of the visual system that is likely to result from some cells 'misinterpreting' the ecdysteroid peaks that drive metamorphosis.",2010,"Lynn M Riddiford, James W Truman, Yu-Chi Shen, Christen K Mirth"

However, with D. melanogaster our knowledge of the behavioral activity of olfactory receptor ligands has relied largely on close-range attraction, rather than on long-range orientation behavior. We developed a flight assay to relate chemosensory perception to behavior. Headspace volatiles from vinegar attracted 62% of assayed flies during a 15-min experimental period. Flies responded irrespective of age, sex, and mating state, provided they had been starved. To identify behaviorally relevant chemicals from vinegar, we compared the responses to vinegar and synthetic chemicals. Stimuli were applied by a piezoelectric sprayer at known and constant release rates. Re-vaporized methanol extracts of Super Q-trapped vinegar volatiles attracted as many flies as vinegar. The main volatile component of vinegar, acetic acid, elicited significant attraction as a single compound. Two other vinegar volatiles, 2-phenyl ethanol and acetoin, produced a synergistic effect when added to acetic acid. Geosmin, a microbiological off-flavor, diminished attraction to vinegar.

The steroid hormone ecdysone functions with intrinsic chromatin remodeling factors to control female germline stem cells in Drosophila,21040900,10.1016/j.stem.2010.10.001,"Steroid hormones are known systemic regulators of multiple normal and cancerous tissues; however, whether or how they impact the fate and function of adult stem cells is unclear.

Here, we report that ecdysone, a steroid hormone structurally related to mammalian sex steroids, directly regulates adult GSC proliferation and self-renewal independently of insulin signaling. Ecdysone controls GSCs through a functional interaction with the chromatin remodeling factors ISWI, an intrinsic epigenetic factor required for GSC fate and activity, and Nurf301, the largest subunit of the ISWI-containing NURF chromatin remodeling complex.

Tau Ser262 phosphorylation is critical for Abeta42-induced tau toxicity in a transgenic Drosophila model of Alzheimer's disease,20466736,10.1093/hmg/ddq200,"The amyloid-beta 42 (Abeta42) peptide has been suggested to promote tau phosphorylation and toxicity in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis; however, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Using transgenic Drosophila expressing both human Abeta42 and tau, we show here that tau phosphorylation at Ser262 plays a critical role in Abeta42-induced tau toxicity. Co-expression of Abeta42 increased tau phosphorylation at AD-related sites including Ser262, and enhanced tau-induced neurodegeneration. In contrast, formation of either sarkosyl-insoluble tau or paired helical filaments was not induced by Abeta42. Co-expression of Abeta42 and tau carrying the non-phosphorylatable Ser262Ala mutation did not cause neurodegeneration, suggesting that the Ser262 phosphorylation site is required for the pathogenic interaction between Abeta42 and tau. We have recently reported that the DNA damage-activated Checkpoint kinase 2 (Chk2) phosphorylates tau at Ser262 and enhances tau toxicity in a transgenic Drosophila model. We detected that expression of Chk2, as well as a number of genes involved in DNA repair pathways, was increased in the Abeta42 fly brains. The induction of a DNA repair response is protective against Abeta42 toxicity, since blocking the function of the tumor suppressor p53, a key transcription factor for the induction of DNA repair genes, in neurons exacerbated Abeta42-induced neuronal dysfunction. Our results demonstrate that tau phosphorylation at Ser262 is crucial for Abeta42-induced tau toxicity in vivo, and suggest a new model of AD progression in which activation of DNA repair pathways is protective against Abeta42 toxicity but may trigger tau phosphorylation and toxicity in AD pathogenesis.",2010,"Kanae Iijima-Ando, Anthony Gatt, Koichi Iijima"
Increase in backbone mobility of the VTS1p-SAM domain on binding to SRE-RNA,20004205,10.1016/j.jmb.2009.12.004,"The sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain of VTS1p, a posttranscriptional gene regulator, belongs to a family of SAM domains conserved from yeast to humans. Even though SAM domains were originally classified as protein-protein interaction domains, recently, it was shown that the yeast VTS1p-SAM and the SAM domain of its Drosophila homolog Smaug can specifically recognize RNA hairpins termed Smaug recognition element (SRE). Structural studies of the SRE-RNA complex of VTS1p-SAM revealed that the SAM domain primarily recognizes the shape of the RNA fold induced by the Watson-Crick base-pairing in the RNA pentaloop. Only the central G nucleotide is specifically recognized. The VTS1p-SAM domain recognizes SRE-RNAs with a CNGGN pentaloop where N is any nucleotide. The C1-G4 base pair in the wild type can be replaced by any pair of nucleotides that can form base pairs even though the binding affinity is greatest with a pyrimidine in position 1 and a purine in position 4. The interaction thus combines elements of sequence-specific and non-sequence-specific recognitions. The lack of structural rearrangements in either partner following binding is rather intriguing, suggesting that molecular dynamics may play an important role in imparting relaxed specificity with respect to the exact combination of nucleotides in the loop, except for the central nucleotide. In this work, we extend our previous studies of SRE-RNA interaction with VTS1p, by comparing the dynamics of the VTS1p-SAM domain both in its free form and when bound to SRE-RNA. The 15N relaxation studies of backbone dynamics suggest the presence of a dynamic interaction interface, with residues associated with specific G3 recognition becoming more rigid on RNA binding while other regions attain increased flexibility. The results parallel the observations from our studies of dynamics changes in SRE-RNA upon binding to VTS1p-SAM and shows that molecular dynamics could play a crucial role in modulating binding affinity and possibly contribute to the free energy of the interaction through an entropy-driven mechanism.",2010,"Florian C Oberstrass, Frédéric H-T Allain, Sapna Ravindranathan"
POSH misexpression induces caspase-dependent cell death in Drosophila,20014406,10.1002/dvdy.22186,"POSH (Plenty of SH3 domains) is a scaffold for signaling proteins regulating cell survival. Specifically, POSH promotes assembly of a complex including Rac GTPase, mixed lineage kinase (MLK), MKK7, and Jun kinase (JNK). In Drosophila, genetic analysis implicated POSH in Tak1-dependent innate immune response, in part through regulation of JNK signaling. Homologs of the POSH signaling complex components, MLK and MKK7, are essential in Drosophila embryonic dorsal closure. Using a gain-of-function approach, we tested whether POSH plays a role in this process. Ectopic expression of POSH in the embryo causes dorsal closure defects due to apoptosis of the amnioserosa, but ectodermal JNK signaling is normal. Phenotypic consequences of POSH expression were found to be dependent on Drosophila Nc, the caspase-9 homolog, but only partially on Tak1 and not at all on Slpr and Hep.

Footprinting and misexpression studies have led to the proposal that the Pax6 homologue twin of eyeless (toy) directly regulates the initiation of so expression in ocellar precursor cells. However, so expression in a toy loss-of-function mutant background has not been yet analyzed due to the lack of eye-antennal disc development in strong toy mutant alleles. Using an embryonic eye primordium-specific enhancer of toy, we have rescued the developmental defect of a strong toy mutant allele and analyzed so expression in the ocelli primordium of toy loss-of-function eye-antennal discs during third instar larva. The results show that so expression is only marginally affected in the absence of Toy transcriptional activity and that the toy positive effect on so expression is largely eya-mediated. These results suggest that eya is the main factor controlling both initiation and maintenance of so expression in ocellar precursor cells.

Optimizing metapopulation sustainability through a checkerboard strategy,20098493,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000643,"The persistence of a spatially structured population is determined by the rate of dispersal among habitat patches. If the local dynamic at the subpopulation level is extinction-prone, the system viability is maximal at intermediate connectivity where recolonization is allowed, but full synchronization that enables correlated extinction is forbidden. Here we developed and used an algorithm for agent-based simulations in order to study the persistence of a stochastic metapopulation. The effect of noise is shown to be dramatic, and the dynamics of the spatial population differs substantially from the predictions of deterministic models. This has been validated for the stochastic versions of the logistic map, the Ricker map and the Nicholson-Bailey host-parasitoid system. To analyze the possibility of extinction, previous studies were focused on the attractiveness (Lyapunov exponent) of stable solutions and the structure of their basin of attraction (dependence on initial population size). Our results suggest that these features are of secondary importance in the presence of stochasticity. Instead, optimal sustainability is achieved when decoherence is maximal. Individual-based simulations of metapopulations of different sizes, dimensions and noise types, show that the system's lifetime peaks when it displays checkerboard spatial patterns. This conclusion is supported by the results of a recently published Drosophila experiment. The checkerboard strategy provides a technique for the manipulation of migration rates (e.g., by constructing corridors) in order to affect the persistence of a metapopulation. It may be used in order to minimize the risk of extinction of an endangered species, or to maximize the efficiency of an eradication campaign.",2010,"Nadav M Shnerb, Yossi Ben Zion, Gur Yaari"

The time to measure positional information: maternal hunchback is required for the synchrony of the Bicoid transcriptional response at the onset of zygotic transcription,20663819,10.1242/dev.051300,"It is widely accepted that morphogenetic gradients determine cell identity by concentration-dependent activation of target genes. How precise is each step in the gene expression process that acts downstream of morphogens, however, remains unclear. The Bicoid morphogen is a transcription factor directly activating its target genes and provides thus a simple system to address this issue in a quantitative manner. Recent studies indicate that the Bicoid gradient is precisely established in Drosophila embryos after eight nuclear divisions (cycle 9) and that target protein expression is specified five divisions later (cycle 14), with a precision that corresponds to a relative difference of Bicoid concentration of 10%. To understand how such precision was achieved, we directly analyzed nascent transcripts of the hunchback target gene at their site of synthesis. Most anterior nuclei in cycle 11 interphasic embryos exhibit efficient biallelic transcription of hunchback and this synchronous expression is specified within a 10% difference of Bicoid concentration. The fast diffusion of Bcd-EGFP (7.7 mum(2)/s) that we captured by fluorescent correlation spectroscopy in the nucleus is consistent with this robust expression at cycle 11. However, given the interruption of transcription during mitosis, it remains too slow to be consistent with precise de novo reading of Bicoid concentration at each interphase, suggesting the existence of a memorization process that recalls this information from earlier cycles.

Feeding a Drosophila HD model cystamine, or expressing a transgene encoding the anti-htt intracellular antibody (intrabody) C4-scFv in the nervous system, demonstrated therapeutic potential, but suppression of pathology was incomplete. We hypothesized that a combinatorial approach entailing drug and intrabody administration could enhance rescue of HD pathology in flies and that timing of treatment would affect outcomes. Feeding cystamine to adult HD flies expressing the intrabody resulted in a significant, additional rescue of photoreceptor neurodegeneration, but no additional benefit in longevity. Feeding cystamine during both larval and adult stages produced the converse result: longevity was significantly improved, but increased photoreceptor survival was not. We conclude that cystamine-intrabody combination therapies can be effective, reducing neurodegeneration and prolonging survival, depending on administration protocols.",2010,"A Messer, A J Ahern-Rindell, S F Bortvedt, J A McLear, W J Wolfgang"
Circadian control of global gene expression patterns,20809800,10.1146/annurev-genet-102209-163432,"An internal time-keeping mechanism has been observed in almost every organism studied from archaea to humans.

However, understanding the mechanistic link between the clock and output responses has been elusive. In three model organisms, Arabidopsis thaliana, Drosophila melanogaster, and Mus musculus, whole-genome expression arrays have enabled researchers to investigate how maintaining a time-keeping mechanism connects to an adaptive advantage.

The Hippo pathway regulates Wnt/beta-catenin signaling,20412773,10.1016/j.devcel.2010.03.007,"Several developmental pathways contribute to processes that regulate tissue growth and organ size. The Hippo pathway has emerged as one such critical regulator. However, how Hippo signaling is integrated with other pathways to coordinate these processes remains unclear. Here, we show that the Hippo pathway restricts Wnt/beta-Catenin signaling by promoting an interaction between TAZ and DVL in the cytoplasm. TAZ inhibits the CK1delta/epsilon-mediated phosphorylation of DVL, thereby inhibiting Wnt/beta-Catenin signaling. Abrogation of TAZ levels or Hippo signaling enhances Wnt3A-stimulated DVL phosphorylation, nuclear beta-Catenin, and Wnt target gene expression. Mice lacking Taz develop polycystic kidneys with enhanced cytoplasmic and nuclear beta-Catenin. Moreover, in Drosophila, Hippo signaling modulates Wg target gene expression. These results uncover a cytoplasmic function of TAZ in regulating Wnt signaling and highlight the role of the Hippo pathway in coordinating morphogenetic signaling with growth control.",2010,"Bryan W Miller, Siyuan Song, Helen McNeill, Xaralabos Varelas, Walter Hunziker, Rui Sakuma, Jeffrey L Wrana, Frederic A Fellouse, Tony Pawson, Richelle Sopko, Liliana Attisano, Alex Gregorieff"
Linking H3K79 trimethylation to Wnt signaling through a novel Dot1-containing complex (DotCom),20203130,10.1101/gad.1898410,"Epigenetic modifications of chromatin play an important role in the regulation of gene expression. KMT4/Dot1 is a conserved histone methyltransferase capable of methylating chromatin on Lys79 of histone H3 (H3K79). Here we report the identification of a multisubunit Dot1 complex (DotCom), which includes several of the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) partners in leukemia such as ENL, AF9/MLLT3, AF17/MLLT6, and AF10/MLLT10, as well as the known Wnt pathway modifiers TRRAP, Skp1, and beta-catenin. We demonstrated that the human DotCom is indeed capable of trimethylating H3K79 and, given the association of beta-catenin, Skp1, and TRRAP, we investigated, and found, a role for Dot1 in Wnt/Wingless signaling in an in vivo model system. Knockdown of Dot1 in Drosophila results in decreased expression of a subset of Wingless target genes. Furthermore, the loss of expression for the Drosophila homologs of the Dot1-associated proteins involved in the regulation of H3K79 shows a similar reduction in expression of these Wingless targets. From yeast to human, specific trimethylation of H3K79 by Dot1 requires the monoubiquitination of histone H2B by the Rad6/Bre1 complex. Here, we demonstrate that depletion of Bre1, the E3 ligase required for H2B monoubiquitination, leads specifically to reduced bulk H3K79 trimethylation levels and a reduction in expression of many Wingless targets. Overall, our study describes for the first time the components of DotCom and links the specific regulation of H3K79 trimethylation by Dot1 and its associated factors to the Wnt/Wingless signaling pathway.",2010,"Chengqi Lin, Michael P Washburn, Laurence Florens, Ali Shilatifard, Hans-Martin Herz, Ka Chun Lai, Yoh-Hei Takahashi, Man Mohan, Ying Zhang"
[Intercalary heterochromatin in the genome of Drosophila],21254566,,"The modern concept of intercalary heterochromatin as polytene chromosome regions exhibiting a number of specific characteristics is formulated. DNA constituting these regions is replicated late in the S period; therefore, some strands of polytene chromosomes are underrepresented; i.e., they are underreplicated. Late-replicating regions account for about 7% of the genome; genes are located there in clusters of as many as 40. In general, the gene density in the clusters is substantially lower than in the main part of the genome.

Intronic AT skew is a defendable proxy for germline transcription but does not predict crossing-over or protein evolution rates in Drosophila melanogaster,20938653,10.1007/s00239-010-9395-2,"Recent evidence suggests that germline transcription may affect both protein evolutionary rates, possibly mediated by repair processes, and recombination rates, possibly mediated by chromatin and epigenetic modification. Here, we test these propositions in Drosophila melanogaster. The challenge for such analyses is to provide defendable measures of germline gene expression. Intronic AT skew is a good candidate measure as it is thought to be a consequence, at least in part, of transcription-coupled repair. Prior evidence suggests that intronic AT skew in D. melanogaster is not affected by proximity to intron extremities and differs between transcribed DNA and flanking sequence. We now also establish that intronic AT skew is a defendable proxy for germline expression as (a) it is more similar than expected by chance between introns of the same gene (which is not accounted for by physical proximity), (b) is correlated with male germline expression, and (c) is more pronounced in broadly expressed genes. Furthermore, (d) a trend for intronic skew to differ between 3' and 5' ends of genes is particular to broadly expressed genes. Finally, (e) controlling for physical distance, introns of proximate genes are most different in skew if they have different tissue specificity. We find that intronic AT skew, employed as a proxy for germline transcription, correlates neither with recombination rates nor with the rate of protein evolution. We conclude that there is no prima facie evidence that germline expression modulates recombination rates or monotonically affects protein evolution rates in D. melanogaster.",2010,"Claudia C Weber, Laurence D Hurst"

Here we describe how Drosophila can be used to study the interactions between sperm and the female reproductive tract. Like many insects, Drosophila has two types of sperm storage organs, the spermatheca and seminal receptacle, whose ducts arise from the uterine wall. The spermatheca duct ends in a capsule-like structure surrounded by a layer of gland cells. In contrast, the seminal receptacle is a slender, blind-ended tubule. Recent studies suggest that the spermatheca is specialized for long-term storage, as well as sperm maturation, whereas the receptacle functions in short-term sperm storage. Here we discuss recent molecular and morphological analyses that highlight possible themes of gamete interaction with the female reproductive tract and draw comparison of sperm storage organ design in Drosophila and other animals, particularly mammals. Furthermore, we discuss how the study of multiple sperm storage organ types in Drosophila may help us identify factors essential for sperm viability and, moreover, factors that promote long-term sperm survivorship.",2010,"Y Heifetz, P K Rivlin"

The fruit fly has been a great model to decipher various aspects of the immune response of invertebrates, including the transcriptional regulation of the antimicrobial genes during systemic response. Various reports have recently shown that Drosophila can also be used as a model system to study the mechanisms that control epithelial immune responses and more specifically gut immunity.

"meis1 regulates cyclin D1 and c-myc expression, and controls the proliferation of the multipotent cells in the early developing zebrafish eye",18216175,10.1242/dev.011932,"During eye development, retinal progenitors are drawn from a multipotent, proliferative cell population. In Drosophila the maintenance of this cell population requires the function of the TALE-homeodomain transcription factor Hth, although its mechanisms of action are still unknown. Here we investigate whether members of the Meis gene family, the vertebrate homologs of hth, are also involved in early stages of eye development in the zebrafish. We show that meis1 is initially expressed throughout the eye primordium. Later, meis1 becomes repressed as neurogenesis is initiated, and its expression is confined to the ciliary margin, where the retinal stem population resides. Knocking down meis1 function through morpholino injection causes a delay in the G1-to-S phase transition of the eye cells, and results in severely reduced eyes. This role in cell cycle control is mediated by meis1 regulating cyclin D1 and c-myc transcription. The forced maintenance of meis1 expression in cell clones is incompatible with the normal differentiation of the meis1-expressing cells, which in turn tend to reside in undifferentiated regions of the retinal neuroepithelium, such as the ciliary margin. Together, these results implicate meis1 as a positive cell cycle regulator in early retinal cells, and provide evidence of an evolutionary conserved function for Hth/Meis genes in the maintenance of the proliferative, multipotent cell state during early eye development.",2008,"Joana Santos, Maria J Tavares, Thomas S Becker, Hiroshi Kikuta, José Bessa, Mary Laplante, José Luis Gómez-Skarmeta, Fernando Casares"

Fifty years of cytogenetics: a parallel view of the evolution of cytogenetics and genotoxicology,18515111,10.1016/j.bbagrm.2008.05.003,"A parallelism exists between human cytogenetics and cytogenetic toxicology. The breakthroughs, mostly coming from and used in clinical genetics, are widely used in genetic toxicology. The birth of human cytogenetics occurred in 1956 when it was published that the diploid number of chromosomes in humans is 46. The first stage in chromosome-induced mutagenesis began in 1938 when Sax published the effects of X-rays on the chromosomes of Drosophila. In 1959, the cytogenetic anomalies for Down, Klinefelter, and Turner syndromes were described, and parallelly in 1960, the first publication on chromosomal aberrations in man caused by ionizing radiation appeared. The cytogenetic analysis of chromosomal aberrations in cell cultures is considered one of the primary methods to evaluate induced mutagenesis. At the end of the 1960s, banding techniques allowed chromosomes to be individually identified, in parallel, the sister chromatid exchange analysis technology was described. Another milestone in the history of induced mutagenesis was the discovery that mutagenic agents were able to alter chromosomal division and segregation in gonads inducing meiotic nondisjunction. Here we review new approaches and applications such as biological dosimetry, translocation scoring using FISH, and micronucleus test. Chromosomal aberrations and micronucleus test are now effective cytogenetic biomarkers of early effect used as cancer predictors. Human cytogenetics has proven to be effective over its 50-year lifespan and, although each new technique that has appeared seemed to announce its end, the fact is that the current state of cytogenetics is in reality a collection of techniques that, while common, are cheap, fast, and wide-ranging. Therefore, in genotoxicology, they continue to be useful to identify mutagenic agents as well as to evaluate and analyze exposed populations.",2008,J M Garcia-Sagredo
"An approximate bayesian estimator suggests strong, recurrent selective sweeps in Drosophila",18802463,10.1371/journal.pgen.1000198,"The recurrent fixation of newly arising, beneficial mutations in a species reduces levels of linked neutral variability. Models positing frequent weakly beneficial substitutions or, alternatively, rare, strongly selected substitutions predict similar average effects on linked neutral variability, if the product of the rate and strength of selection is held constant. We propose an approximate Bayesian (ABC) polymorphism-based estimator that can be used to distinguish between these models, and apply it to multi-locus data from Drosophila melanogaster. We investigate the extent to which inference about the strength of selection is sensitive to assumptions about the underlying distributions of the rates of substitution and recombination, the strength of selection, heterogeneity in mutation rate, as well as the population's demographic history. We show that assuming fixed values of selection parameters in estimation leads to overestimates of the strength of selection and underestimates of the rate. We estimate parameters for an African population of D. melanogaster (ŝ approximately 2E-03, ) and compare these to previous estimates. Finally, we show that surveying larger genomic regions is expected to lend much more discriminatory power to the approach. It will thus be of great interest to apply this method to emerging whole-genome polymorphism data sets in many taxa.",2008,"Kevin R Thornton, Peter Andolfatto, Jeffrey D Jensen"

In this report, we observe that Drosophila mutants lacking Fak56 exhibit a decreased lifespan, accompanied by a bang-sensitive phenotype, which is characterized by sensitivity to mechanical and high-frequency electrical stimulation. Fak56 mutant animals display lower thresholds and higher rates of seizures in response to electroconvulsive stimuli. Direct measurements of action potential conduction in larval segmental nerves demonstrate a slowed propagation speed and failure during high-frequency nerve stimulation. In addition, neuromuscular junctions in Fak56 mutant animals display transmission blockade during high-frequency activity as a result of action potential failure. Endogenous Fak56 protein is abundant in glial cells ensheathing the axon bundles, and structural alterations of segmental nerve bundles can be observed in mutants. Manipulation of Fak56 function specifically in glial cells also disrupts action potential conduction and neurotransmission, suggesting a glial component in the Fak56 bang-sensitive phenotype. Furthermore, we show that increased intracellular calcium levels result in the dephosphorylation of endogenous Fak56 protein in Drosophila cell lines, in parallel with our observations of highly variable synaptic potentials at a higher Ca2+ level in Fak56 mutant larvae.

mDia2 induces the actin scaffold for the contractile ring and stabilizes its position during cytokinesis in NIH 3T3 cells,18287523,10.1091/mbc.e07-10-1086,"mDia proteins are mammalian homologues of Drosophila diaphanous and belong to the formin family proteins that catalyze actin nucleation and polymerization. Although formin family proteins of nonmammalian species such as Drosophila diaphanous are essential in cytokinesis, whether and how mDia proteins function in cytokinesis remain unknown. Here we depleted each of the three mDia isoforms in NIH 3T3 cells by RNA interference and examined this issue. Depletion of mDia2 selectively increased the number of binucleate cells, which was corrected by coexpression of RNAi-resistant full-length mDia2. mDia2 accumulates in the cleavage furrow during anaphase to telophase, and concentrates in the midbody at the end of cytokinesis. Depletion of mDia2 induced contraction at aberrant sites of dividing cells, where contractile ring components such as RhoA, myosin, anillin, and phosphorylated ERM accumulated. Treatment with blebbistatin suppressed abnormal contraction, corrected localization of the above components, and revealed that the amount of F-actin at the equatorial region during anaphase/telophase was significantly decreased with mDia2 RNAi.

However, there is a lack of specific chemical methods to selectively detect those adducts formed in vivo at low concentrations. In this work, a new sensitive and selective method of determining cisplatin-DNA adducts based on the use of element-selective mass spectrometry is proposed, and the method is then applied to detect cisplatin adducts induced in vivo in somatic cells of Drosophila melanogaster. The bioanalytical strategy proposed here allows the determination of the most important DNA adduct formed between adjacent guanine units of the same DNA strand with cisplatin, and it is based on the coupling of capillary liquid chromatography (cap-LC) to inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). This set-up allows the simultaneous monitoring of the Pt (from the drug) and P (from the DNA components) present in these adducts, once they have been cleaved by enzymatic hydrolysis of the DNA samples. Using this instrumental set-up, the adducts of cisplatin formed in vivo when D. melanogaster flies are exposed to different cisplatin concentrations can be detected and their concentration determined. The results obtained show a direct correlation between the concentration of cisplatin adducts, the induced genotoxic damage (measured as DNA strand breaks using the Comet assay) and the cisplatin concentration.

Mob4 plays a role in spindle focusing in Drosophila S2 cells,18388316,10.1242/jcs.017210,"The characteristic bipolar shape of the mitotic spindle is produced by the focusing of the minus ends of microtubules at the spindle poles. The focus is maintained by the centrosome, a microtubule-nucleating organelle, as well as by proteins that are capable of focusing kinetochore fibers (K fibers) even in the absence of a centrosome. Here, we have performed a small-scale RNA interference (RNAi) screen of known or suspected pole-related proteins in Drosophila S2 cells. An unexpected outcome of this screen was the finding that one of the four Drosophila Mob proteins (a family of kinase regulators) plays a role in spindle pole organization. Time-lapse microscopy of mitotic cells depleted of Drosophila Mob4 by RNAi revealed that the K fibers splay apart and do not maintain their focus either in the presence or absence of functional centrosomes. The Mob4 RNAi phenotype most closely resembles that observed after depletion of the protein encoded by abnormal spindle (Asp), although Asp localization is not substantially affected by Mob4 RNAi. Expression of a Drosophila Mob4-GFP fusion protein revealed its localization to the nucleus in interphase and to spindle poles and kinetochores during mitosis. We propose that Mob4 in Drosophila controls a mitotic kinase that in turn regulates downstream target proteins involved in K fiber focusing at the poles.",2008,"Nicole M Mahoney, Ronald D Vale, David A Agard, Matthew A Trammell"
dGRASP-mediated noncanonical integrin secretion is required for Drosophila epithelial remodeling,18267086,10.1016/j.devcel.2007.12.006,"Integral plasma membrane proteins are typically transported in the secretory pathway from the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi complex. Here we show that at specific stages of Drosophila development corresponding to morphological changes in epithelia, apposed basolateral membranes separate slightly, allowing new plasma membrane contacts with basal extracellular matrix. At these sites, newly synthesized integrin alpha subunits are deposited via a mechanism that appears to bypass the Golgi. We show that the Drosophila Golgi resident protein dGRASP localizes to these membrane domains and that, in the absence of dGRASP, the integrin subunit is retained intracellularly in both follicular and wing epithelia that are found disrupted. We propose that this dGRASP-mediated noncanonical secretion route allows for developmental regulation of integrin function upon epithelial remodeling.

Starvation resistance is positively correlated with body lipid proportion in five wild caught Drosophila simulans populations,18706419,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2008.07.009,"Stress resistance traits in Drosophila often show clinal variation, suggesting that selection affects resistance traits either directly or indirectly. One of the most common causes of stress for animals is the shortage or suboptimal quality of food, and individuals within many species must survive periods of starvation or exposure to nutritionally imbalanced diets. This study determines the relationship between starvation resistance, body lipid content, and lifespan in five recently collected Drosophila simulans populations from four distinct geographic localities. Despite rearing under standard nutritional conditions, we observed significant differences in starvation resistance between sexes and between localities. If body lipid proportion is included as a covariate in statistical analysis the difference between the sexes remains (slopes are parallel, with males more susceptible than females to starvation across all lipid proportions) but the effect of locality disappears. This result suggests that flies from different localities differ in their susceptibility to starvation because of differences in their propensity to store body lipid. We observed a negative relationship between lifespan and starvation resistance in both males and females, suggesting a fitness cost to increasing lipid reserves. These data raise issues about the role of diet in maintaining life history trait variation within and among populations. In conclusion, we show many similarities and surprising differences in life history traits between D. simulans and Drosophila melanogaster.",2008,"R G Melvin, S J Simpson, J William O Ballard"

HexNAcitol, hexitol, xylosylated hexitol, and branching extension of core 1 with HexNAc (to generate core 2 glycans) were also evident following release and reduction. After Galbeta1-3GalNAc, the next most prevalent glycans were a mixture of novel, isobaric, linear, and branched forms of a glucuronyl core 1 disaccharide. Other less prevalent structures were also extended with HexA, including an O-fucose glycan. Although the expected disaccharide product of the Fringe glycosyltransferase, (GlcNAcbeta1-3)fucitol, was not detectable in whole embryos, mass spectrometry fragmentation and exoglycosidase sensitivity defined a novel glucuronyl trisaccharide as GlcNAcbeta1-3(GlcAbeta1-4)fucitol. Consistent with the spatial distribution of the Fringe function, the GlcA-extended form of the Fringe product was enriched in the dorsal portion of the wing imaginal disc. Furthermore, loss of Fringe activity reduced the prevalence of the O-Fuc trisaccharide. Therefore, O-Fuc glycans necessary for the modulation of important signaling events in Drosophila are, as in vertebrates, substrates for extension beyond the addition of a single HexNAc.",2008,"Brian Dong, Khoi Nguyen, Mindy Porterfield, Samuel S Lee, Katherine H McGlamry, Kazuhiro Aoki, Michael Tiemeyer"
Asymmetric centrosome behavior and the mechanisms of stem cell division,18209101,10.1083/jcb.200707083,"The ability of dividing cells to produce daughters with different fates is an important developmental mechanism conserved from bacteria to fungi, plants, and metazoan animals. Asymmetric outcomes of a cell division can be specified by two general mechanisms: asymmetric segregation of intrinsic fate determinants or asymmetric placement of daughter cells into microenvironments that provide extrinsic signals that direct cells to different states. For both, spindle orientation must be coordinated with the localization of intrinsic determinants or source of extrinsic signals to achieve the proper asymmetric outcome. Recent work on spindle orientation in Drosophila melanogaster male germline stem cells and neuroblasts has brought into sharp focus the key role of differential centrosome behavior in developmentally programmed asymmetric division (for reviews see Cabernard, C., and C.Q. Doe. 2007. Curr. Biol. 17:R465-R467; Gonzalez, C. 2007. Nat. Rev. Genet. 8:462-472). These findings provide new insights and suggest intriguing new models for how cells coordinate spindle orientation with their cellular microenvironment to regulate and direct cell fate decisions within tissues.",2008,"Margaret T Fuller, Yukiko M Yamashita"
Drosophila RalA is essential for the maintenance of Jak/Stat signalling in ovarian follicles,18552769,10.1038/embor.2008.79,"Small GTPases of the Ras-like (Ral) family are crucial for signalling functions in both normal and cancer cells; however, their role in a developing organism is poorly understood. Here, we identify the Drosophila Ral homologue RalA as a new key regulator of polar-cell differentiation during oogenesis. Polar cells have a crucial role in patterning the egg chamber and in recruiting border cells, which undergo collective and guided migration. We show that RalA function is essential for the maintenance of anterior and posterior polar-cell fate and survival. RalA is required cell autonomously to control the expression of polar-cell-specific markers, including the Jak/Stat ligand Unpaired. The loss of RalA also causes a cell non-autonomous phenotype owing to reduced Jak/Stat signalling in neighbouring follicle cells. As a result, border-cell assembly and migration as well as the polarization of the oocyte are defective. Thus, RalA is required in organizing centres to control proper patterning and migration in vivo.",2008,"Christian Ghiglione, Olivier Devergne, Stéphane Noselli, Delphine Cerezo"
Term-tissue specific models for prediction of gene ontology biological processes using transcriptional profiles of aging in drosophila melanogaster,18307794,10.1186/1471-2105-9-129,"Background: Predictive classification on the base of gene expression profiles appeared recently as an attractive strategy for identifying the biological functions of genes. Gene Ontology (GO) provides a valuable source of knowledge for model training and validation. The increasing collection of microarray data represents a valuable source for generating functional hypotheses of uncharacterized genes. Results: This study focused on using support vector machines (SVM) to predict GO biological processes from individual or multiple-tissue transcriptional profiles of aging in Drosophila melanogaster. Ten-fold cross validation was implemented to evaluate the prediction. One-tail Fisher's exact test was conducted on each cross validation and multiple testing was addressed using BH FDR procedure. The results showed that, of the 148 pursued GO biological processes, fifteen terms each had at least one model with FDR-adjusted p-value (Adj.p) <0.05 and six had the values between 0.05 and 0.25. Furthermore, all these models had the prediction sensitivity (SN) over 30% and specificity (SP) over 80%. Conclusion: We proposed the concept of term-tissue specific models indicating the fact that the major part of the optimized prediction models was trained from individual tissue data. Furthermore, we observed that the memberships of the genes involved in all the three pursued children biological processes on mitochondrial electron transport could be predicted from the transcriptional profiles of aging (Adj.p < 0.01). This finding may be important in biology because the genes of mitochondria play a critical role in the longevity of C. elegans and D. melanogaster.",2008,"Wensheng Zhang, Jiuzhou Song, Sige Zou"
The Drosophila KASH domain proteins Msp-300 and Klarsicht and the SUN domain protein Klaroid have no essential function during oogenesis,18820478,10.4161/fly.6288,"Proteins harboring a C-terminal KASH (Klarsicht/Anc-1/Syne Homology) domain, which attaches to the nucleus, have been identified in many different organisms. Two KASH proteins are known from Drosophila, Msp-300 and Klarsicht, the latter of which plays a role in nuclear migration during eye development. Here, we show that a complete deletion of Msp-300 leads to larval lethality. This lethality appears to be due to Msp-300 isoforms containing the N-terminal actin binding, but not the C-terminal KASH domain. Msp-300 and Klar are expressed during oogenesis and localize to the nuclear envelope of the germ line nuclei. However, neither Msp-300 single mutants nor Msp-300; klar double mutants cause defects in nuclear migration or anchoring during oogenesis. Germ line nuclear envelope localization of both KASH domain proteins depends on klaroid, the only Drosophila SUN domain homolog expressed in females. Like Msp-300 and klar, klaroid is also dispensable for normal ovarian development.",2008,"Martin Technau, Siegfried Roth"
Pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) has different effects on Drosophila's circadian clocks in the accessory medulla and in the dorsal brain,18838607,10.1177/0748730408322699,"The neuropeptide pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) is a key transmitter in the circadian clock of Drosophila melanogaster. Here we studied the rhythmic behavior of neural mutants with modified arborizations of the large PDF neurons. In sine oculis(1) (so(1)) mutants we found a higher density of PDF fibers in the fly's pacemaker center, the accessory medulla. These flies exhibited a significantly longer period (24.6 h) than control flies. When PDF levels were elevated to very high levels in the dorsal brain as true for so(mda) mutants and small optic lobes;so(1) double mutants (sol(1);so( 1)), a short-period component split off the long period in behavioral rhythmicity. The short period became shorter the higher the amount of PDF in this brain region and reached a value of approximately 21 h. The period alterations were clearly dependent on PDF, because so(1);Pdf 01 and so(mda);Pdf 01 double mutants showed a single free-running component with a period similar to Pdf 01 mutants (approximately 22.5 h) and significantly longer than the short period of so(mda) mutants. These observations indicate that PDF feeds back on the clock neurons and changes their period. Obviously, PDF lengthens the period of some clock neurons and shortens that of others.",2008,"Charlotte Helfrich-Förster, Corinna Wülbeck, Eva Grieshaber"
A fluorescent reporter of caspase activity for live imaging,18779587,10.1073/pnas.0806983105,"There is a growing interest in the mechanisms that control the apoptosis cascade during development and adult life. To investigate the regulatory events that trigger apoptosis in whole tissues, we have devised a genetically encoded caspase sensor that can be detected in live and fixed tissue by standard confocal microscopy. The sensor comprises two fluorophores, mRFP, monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP) and enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP), that are linked by an efficient and specific caspase-sensitive site. Upon caspase activation, the sensor is cleaved and eGFP translocates to the nucleus, leaving mRFP at membranes. This is detected before other markers of apoptosis, including anti-cleaved caspase 3 immunoreactivity. Moreover, the sensor does not perturb normal developmental apoptosis and is specific, as cleavage does not occur in Drosophila embryos that are unable to activate the apoptotic cascade. Importantly, dying cells can be recognized in live embryos, thus opening the way for in vivo imaging. As expected from the high conservation of caspases, it is also cleaved in dying cells of chick embryos. It is therefore likely to be generally useful to track the spatiotemporal pattern of caspase activity in a variety of species.",2008,"Anita Mynett, Irene Miguel-Aliaga, James Briscoe, Pascal Meier, Golnar Kolahgar, Pierre-Luc Bardet, Jean-Paul Vincent"
Interactions between transposable elements and Argonautes have (probably) been shaping the Drosophila genome throughout evolution,18313288,10.1016/j.gde.2008.01.002,"Transposable elements (TEs) are powerful mutagenic agents responsible for generating variation in the host genome. As TEs can be overtly deleterious, a variety of different mechanisms have evolved to keep their activities in check. In plants, fungi, and animals, RNA silencing has been implicated as a major defense against repetitive element transposition. This nucleic acid-based defense mechanism also appears to be directed at inherited silencing of TEs without altering the underlying DNA sequence. Complex interactions between TEs and RNA silencing machineries have been co-opted to regulate cellular genes.",2008,"Haruhiko Siomi, Mikiko C Siomi"
Nervous wreck and Cdc42 cooperate to regulate endocytic actin assembly during synaptic growth,18701694,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2304-08.2008,"Regulation of synaptic morphology depends on endocytosis of activated growth signal receptors, but the mechanisms regulating this membrane-trafficking event are unclear. Actin polymerization mediated by Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASp) and the actin-related protein 2/3 complex generates forces at multiple stages of endocytosis. FCH-BIN amphiphysin RVS (F-BAR)/SH3 domain proteins play key roles in this process by coordinating membrane deformation with WASp-dependent actin polymerization. However, it is not known how other WASp ligands, such as the small GTPase Cdc42, coordinate with F-BAR/SH3 proteins to regulate actin polymerization at membranes. Nervous Wreck (Nwk) is a conserved neuronal F-BAR/SH3 protein that localizes to periactive zones at the Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ) and is required for regulation of synaptic growth via bone morphogenic protein signaling. Here, we show that Nwk interacts with the endocytic proteins dynamin and Dap160 and functions together with Cdc42 to promote WASp-mediated actin polymerization in vitro and to regulate synaptic growth in vivo. Cdc42 function is associated with Rab11-dependent recycling endosomes, and we show that Rab11 colocalizes with Nwk at the NMJ. Together, our results suggest that synaptic growth activated by growth factor signaling is controlled at an endosomal compartment via coordinated Nwk and Cdc42-dependent actin assembly.",2008,"Rebecca N Motola-Barnes, J Troy Littleton, Avital A Rodal"
Nuclear translocation of immulectin-3 stimulates hemocyte proliferation,18282603,10.1016/j.molimm.2007.12.021,"Immulectin-3 (IML-3) is a C-type lectin from the tobacco hornworm Manduca sexta that contains a motif (NWGV) similar to the BH1 motif (NWGR) of the mammalian galectin-3. IML-3 is synthesized in fat body and secreted into hemolymph, but can be translocated into hemocytes. In this study, we showed that IML-3 was predominantly localized to the nucleus of hemocytes and some metaphase, anaphase and telophase hemocytes from M. sexta larvae injected with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). IML-3 was detected in the membrane and soluble extracts of hemocytes, suggesting that it may be translocated into hemocytes via receptor-mediated endocytosis. To investigate the role of IML-3 translocation to the nucleus, we expressed recombinant wild-type IML-3 and a deletion mutant DeltaIML-3 that has the NWGV motif deleted in Drosophila S2 cells. We found that recombinant wild-type IML-3, but not DeltaIML-3, was localized to the nucleus of some S2 cells and also detected in the nuclear extract. Expression of recombinant wild-type IML-3, but not DeltaIML-3 or GFP, increased the number of proliferating S2 cells.

Kuz and TACE can activate Notch independent of ligand,18535782,10.1007/s00018-008-8127-x,"A central mechanism in activation of the Notch signaling pathway is cleavage of the Notch receptor by ADAM metalloproteases. ADAMs also cleave Delta, the ligand for Notch, thereby downregulating Notch signals. Two ADAMs, Kuzbanian (Kuz) and TNF-alpha converting enzyme (TACE), are known to process both Delta and Notch, yet the role of these cleavages in signal propagation has remained controversial. Using an in vitro model, we show that Kuz regulates Notch signaling primarily by activating the receptor and has little overall effect on signaling via disabling Delta. We confirm that Kuz-dependent activation of Notch requires stimulation of Notch by Delta. However, over-expression of Kuz gives ligand-independent Notch activation. In contrast, TACE, which is elevated in expression in the developing Drosophila nervous system, can efficiently activate Notch in a ligand-independent manner. Altogether, these data demonstrate the potential for Kuz and TACE to participate in context- and mechanism-specific modes of Notch activation.",2008,"M D Rand, A Delwig"
Recombinant baculovirus-based multiple protein expression platform for Drosophila S2 cell culture,17963934,10.1016/j.jbiotec.2007.09.010,"A platform for selective and controllable expression of multiple foreign protein types was developed in insect cell culture. Based on the fact that baculovirus cannot replicate in nonpermissive Drosophila melanogaster Schneider line 2 (S2) cells, S2 cells that stably express human erythropoietin (hEPO) under the control of the S2-derived inducible metallothionein (MT) promoter were infected with three types of recombinant baculoviruses, each of which expressed a different fluorescent protein gene under the control of MT promoter. Addition of copper sulfate as an inducer to infected, stably transfected S2 cells resulted in simultaneous expression of hEPO and three fluorescent proteins. Expression profiles and levels of the three induced fluorescent proteins were similar in all single infected cells. Importantly, expression profiles and levels of hEPO were similar in both non-infected and infected cells, indicating that baculovirus expressed recombinant proteins do not adversely affect expression of host cell recombinant proteins. Expressions of the three fluorescent proteins were able to be selectively regulated by altering combination ratios of the three types of recombinant baculoviruses. Collectively, these data indicate that the baculovirus/stably transfected S2 cell system can be successfully used to express multiple foreign proteins in a controlled and selective manner without the burden of additional selection markers. Such a system would be expected to be attractive as a multiple protein expression platform for engineering metabolic or glycosylation pathways.",2008,"Hyung Joon Cha, Kyoung Ro Kim, Yeon Kyu Kim"

Clonogenic assays are considered the gold-standard to investigate the cytotoxicity of specific treatments or to compare the sensitivity of various cell types for a specific treatment. However, this assay cannot be used for Drosophila S2 cells as they are virtually unable to grow in distinct colonies. We designed a novel fluorescence-based flow cytometry assay to study long-term proliferation of S2 cells under various conditions and in the presence of specific gene products or after downregulation of specific gene products.

Like Saccharomyces, Drosophila nucleosomes are organized around active transcription start sites in a canonical -1, nucleosome-free region, +1 arrangement. However, Drosophila does not incorporate H2A.Z into the -1 nucleosome and does not bury its transcriptional start site in the +1 nucleosome.

Two different mechanisms of planar cell intercalation leading to tissue elongation,18570249,10.1002/dvdy.21609,"During development, certain cells intercalate with each other towards tissue-elongation, exemplified in sea-urchin gut-elongation, amphibian gastrulation, and Drosophila germ-band extension. Their mechanism is not universal among intercalation events. To clarify the minimal cellular properties required for cell-intercalation, we computer-simulated the process using three-dimensional geometrical cell-models. We identified two different mechanisms: (1) cell-junction-remodeling by cell-junction contraction along a specific direction, as observed in Drosophila germ-band extension, and (2) cell-shuffling by orientated cell-extension of bipolar cells, as observed in amphibian gastrulation. The cell-junction-remodeling was characterized by well-defined accumulation of contractile molecules along a specific direction of cell-junctions. Length contraction of approximately one cell-junction per cell is enough for the entire tissue-elongation. The cell-shuffling was characterised by rhythmic cell-extension and orientated movement of cytoskeleton within the elongated cells. Furthermore, tissue-elongation along a polarized axis was limited to a 2.5-fold increase in the cell-junction-remodeling, while no limit was defined for the cell-shuffling.",2008,"Masaharu Tanemura, Tatsuzo Nagai, Hisao Honda"

RNAi screen of endoplasmic reticulum-associated host factors reveals a role for IRE1alpha in supporting Brucella replication,18654626,10.1371/journal.ppat.1000110,"Brucella species are facultative intracellular bacterial pathogens that cause brucellosis, a global zoonosis of profound importance. Although recent studies have demonstrated that Brucella spp. replicate within an intracellular compartment that contains endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident proteins, the molecular mechanisms by which the pathogen secures this replicative niche remain obscure. Here, we address this issue by exploiting Drosophila S2 cells and RNA interference (RNAi) technology to develop a genetically tractable system that recapitulates critical aspects of mammalian cell infection. After validating this system by demonstrating a shared requirement for phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activities in supporting Brucella infection in both host cell systems, we performed an RNAi screen of 240 genes, including 110 ER-associated genes, for molecules that mediate bacterial interactions with the ER. We uncovered 52 evolutionarily conserved host factors that, when depleted, inhibited or increased Brucella infection. Strikingly, 29 of these factors had not been previously suggested to support bacterial infection of host cells. The most intriguing of these was inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), a transmembrane kinase that regulates the eukaryotic unfolded protein response (UPR). We employed IRE1alpha(-/-) murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) to demonstrate a role for this protein in supporting Brucella infection of mammalian cells, and thereby, validated the utility of the Drosophila S2 cell system for uncovering novel Brucella host factors. Finally, we propose a model in which IRE1alpha, and other ER-associated genes uncovered in our screen, mediate Brucella replication by promoting autophagosome biogenesis.",2008,"Jianwu Pei, Paul de Figueiredo, Veronica Ancona, Qing-Ming Qin, Brian D Shaw, Thomas A Ficht"
Multiple roles of Nrf2-Keap1 signaling: regulation of development and xenobiotic response using distinct mechanisms,24406335,10.4161/fly.27007,"Xenobiotic and oxidative responses protect cells from external and internal toxicities.

In a recent study, we revealed novel developmental function and regulatory mechanism of Nrf2 and Keap1 by investigating their Drosophila homolog CncC and dKeap1. We found that CncC and dKeap1 control metamorphosis through regulations of ecdysone biosynthetic genes and ecdysone response genes in different tissues. CncC and dKeap1 cooperatively activate these developmental genes, in contrast to their conserved antagonizing effect to xenobiotic response transcription. In addition, interactions between CncC and Ras signaling in metamorphosis and in transcriptional regulation were established.

An evolutionary shift in the regulation of the Hippo pathway between mice and flies,23563179,10.1038/onc.2013.82,"The Hippo pathway plays a key role in controlling organ growth in many animal species and its deregulation is associated with different types of cancer. Understanding the regulation of the Hippo pathway and discovering upstream regulators is thus a major quest. Interestingly, while the core of the Hippo pathway contains a highly conserved kinase cascade, different components have been identified as upstream regulators in Drosophila and vertebrates. However, whether the regulation of the Hippo pathway is indeed different between Drosophila and vertebrates or whether these differences are due to our limited analysis of these components in different organisms is not known. Here we show that the mouse Fat4 cadherin, the ortholog of the Hippo pathway regulator Fat in Drosophila, does not apparently regulate the Hippo pathway in the murine liver. In fact, we uncovered an evolutionary shift in many of the known upstream regulators at the base of the arthropod lineage. In this evolutionary transition, Fat and the adaptor protein Expanded gained novel domains that connected them to the Hippo pathway, whereas the cell-adhesion receptor Echinoid evolved as a new protein. Subsequently, the junctional adaptor protein Angiomotin (Amot) was lost and the downstream effector Yap lost its PDZ-binding motif that interacts with cell junction proteins.

The PTK7-related transmembrane proteins off-track and off-track 2 are co-receptors for Drosophila Wnt2 required for male fertility,25010066,10.1371/journal.pgen.1004443,"Wnt proteins regulate many developmental processes and are required for tissue homeostasis in adult animals.

Vertebrate protein tyrosine kinase 7 (PTK7) was identified as a Wnt co-receptor required for control of planar cell polarity (PCP) in frogs and mice. We found that flies homozygous for a complete knock-out of the Drosophila PTK7 homolog off track (otk) are viable and fertile and do not show PCP phenotypes. We discovered an otk paralog (otk2, CG8964), which is co-expressed with otk throughout embryonic and larval development. Otk and Otk2 bind to each other and form complexes with Frizzled, Frizzled2 and Wnt2, pointing to a function as Wnt co-receptors. Flies lacking both otk and otk2 are viable but male sterile due to defective morphogenesis of the ejaculatory duct.

An evolutionary analysis of flightin reveals a conserved motif unique and widespread in Pancrustacea,24271855,10.1007/s00239-013-9597-5,"Flightin is a thick filament protein that in Drosophila melanogaster is uniquely expressed in the asynchronous, indirect flight muscles (IFM). Flightin is required for the structure and function of the IFM and is indispensable for flight in Drosophila. Given the importance of flight acquisition in the evolutionary history of insects, here we study the phylogeny and distribution of flightin. Flightin was identified in 69 species of hexapods in classes Collembola (springtails), Protura, Diplura, and insect orders Thysanura (silverfish), Dictyoptera (roaches), Orthoptera (grasshoppers), Pthiraptera (lice), Hemiptera (true bugs), Coleoptera (beetles), Neuroptera (green lacewing), Hymenoptera (bees, ants, and wasps), Lepidoptera (moths), and Diptera (flies and mosquitoes). Flightin was also found in 14 species of crustaceans in orders Anostraca (water flea), Cladocera (brine shrimp), Isopoda (pill bugs), Amphipoda (scuds, sideswimmers), and Decapoda (lobsters, crabs, and shrimps). Flightin was not identified in representatives of chelicerates, myriapods, or any species outside Pancrustacea (Tetraconata, sensu Dohle). Alignment of amino acid sequences revealed a conserved region of 52 amino acids, referred herein as WYR, that is bound by strictly conserved tryptophan (W) and arginine (R) and an intervening sequence with a high content of tyrosines (Y). This motif has no homologs in GenBank or PROSITE and is unique to flightin and paraflightin, a putative flightin paralog identified in decapods. A third motif of unclear affinities to pancrustacean WYR was observed in chelicerates. Phylogenetic analysis of amino acid sequences of the conserved motif suggests that paraflightin originated before the divergence of amphipods, isopods, and decapods. We conclude that flightin originated de novo in the ancestor of Pancrustacea > 500 MYA, well before the divergence of insects (~400 MYA) and the origin of flight (~325 MYA), and that its IFM-specific function in Drosophila is a more recent adaptation.

Structural divergence of plant TCTPs,25120549,10.3389/fpls.2014.00361,"The Translationally Controlled Tumor Protein (TCTP) is a highly conserved protein at the level of sequence, considered to play an essential role in the regulation of growth and development in eukaryotes. However, this function has been inferred from studies in a few model systems, such as mice and mammalian cell lines, Drosophila and Arabidopsis. Thus, the knowledge regarding this protein is far from complete. In the present study bioinformatic analysis showed the presence of one or more TCTP genes per genome in plants with highly conserved signatures and subtle variations at the level of primary structure but with more noticeable differences at the level of predicted three-dimensional structures. These structures show differences in the ""pocket"" region close to the center of the protein and in its flexible loop domain. In fact, all predictive TCTP structures can be divided into two groups: (1) AtTCTP1-like and (2) CmTCTP-like, based on the predicted structures of an Arabidopsis TCTP and a Cucurbita maxima TCTP; according to this classification we propose that their probable function in plants may be inferred in principle. Thus, different TCTP genes in a single organism may have different functions; additionally, in those species harboring a single TCTP gene this could carry multiple functions. On the other hand, in silico analysis of AtTCTP1-like and CmTCTP-like promoters suggest that these share common motifs but with different abundance, which may underscore differences in their gene expression patterns. Finally, the absence of TCTP genes in most chlorophytes with the exception of Coccomyxa subellipsoidea, indicates that other proteins perform the roles played by TCTP or the pathways regulated by TCTP occur through alternative routes.

This method yields an estimate of the error in the measurement to allow statistical comparison. Our method uses a typical in situ hybridization protocol to stain for a target gene and an internal standard, which we refer to as a co-stain. As a proof of concept, we apply this method to multiple lines of transgenic Drosophila embryos, harboring constructs that express reporter genes to different levels. We generated this test set by mutating enhancer sequences to contain different numbers of binding sites for Zelda, a transcriptional activator. We demonstrate that using a co-stain with in situ hybridization is an effective method to compare mRNA levels across samples. This method requires only minor modifications to existing in situ hybridization protocols and uses straightforward analysis techniques.

Experimental evolution of female traits under different levels of intersexual conflict in Drosophila melanogaster,24117169,10.1111/evo.12271,"A number of studies have documented the evolution of female resistance to mate-harm in response to the alteration of intersexual conflict in the populations. However, the life-history consequence of such evolution is still a subject of debate. In this study, we subjected replicate populations of Drosophila melanogaster to different levels of sexual conflict (generated by altering the operational sex ratio) for over 45 generations. Our results suggest that females from populations experiencing higher level of intersexual conflict evolved increased resistance to mate-harm, in terms of both longevity and progeny production. Females from the populations with low conflict were significantly heavier at eclosion and were more susceptible to mate-harm in terms of progeny production under continuous exposure to the males. However, these females produced more progeny upon single mating and had significantly higher longevity in absence of any male exposure-a potential evidence of trade-offs between resistance-related traits and other life-history traits, such as fecundity and longevity. We also report tentative evidence, suggesting an increased male cost of interacting with more resistant females.",2014,"M A Samant, S Sen, N Udaykumar, B Nandy, V Gupta, N G Prasad"
Glia ECM interactions are required to shape the Drosophila nervous system,24859129,10.1016/j.mod.2014.05.003,"Organs are characterized by a specific shape that is often remodeled during development. The dynamics of organ shape is in particular evident during the formation of the Drosophila nervous system. During embryonic stages the central nervous system compacts, whereas selective growth occurs during larval stages. The nervous system is covered by a layer of surface glial cells that form the blood brain barrier and a thick extracellular matrix called neural lamella. The size of the neural lamella is dynamically adjusted to the growing nervous system and we show here that perineurial glial cells secrete proteases to remodel this matrix. Moreover, an imbalance in proteolytic activity results in an abnormal shape of the nervous system. To identify further components controlling nervous system shape we performed an RNAi based screen and identified the gene nolo, which encodes an ADAMTS-like protein. We generated loss of function alleles and demonstrate a requirement in glial cells. Mutant nolo larvae, however, do not show an abnormal nervous system shape. The only predicted off-target of the nolo(dsRNA) is Oatp30B, which encodes an organic anion transporting protein characterized by an extracellular protease inhibitor domain. Loss of function mutants were generated and double mutant analyses demonstrate a genetic interaction between nolo and Oatp30B which prevented the generation of maternal zygotic mutant larvae.",2014,"Christian Klämbt, Silke Meyer, Imke Schmidt"
Drosophila Sirt2/mammalian SIRT3 deacetylates ATP synthase β and regulates complex V activity,25023514,10.1083/jcb.201404118,"Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase β, the catalytic subunit of mitochondrial complex V, synthesizes ATP. We show that ATP synthase β is deacetylated by a human nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+))-dependent protein deacetylase, sirtuin 3, and its Drosophila melanogaster homologue, dSirt2. dsirt2 mutant flies displayed increased acetylation of specific Lys residues in ATP synthase β and decreased complex V activity. Overexpression of dSirt2 increased complex V activity. Substitution of Lys 259 and Lys 480 with Arg in human ATP synthase β, mimicking deacetylation, increased complex V activity, whereas substitution with Gln, mimicking acetylation, decreased activity. Mass spectrometry and proteomic experiments from wild-type and dsirt2 mitochondria identified the Drosophila mitochondrial acetylome and revealed dSirt2 as an important regulator of mitochondrial energy metabolism. Additionally, we unravel a ceramide-NAD(+)-sirtuin axis wherein increased ceramide, a sphingolipid known to induce stress responses, resulted in depletion of NAD(+) and consequent decrease in sirtuin activity. These results provide insight into sirtuin-mediated regulation of complex V and reveal a novel link between ceramide and Drosophila acetylome.",2014,"Alka Singh, Usha R Acharya, Kaori Taguchi, Leslie M Shaw, Takeshi Bamba, Jairaj K Acharya, Lihua Julie Zhu, Motiur Rahman, Eiichiro Fukusaki, Niraj K Nirala, David G Lambright"
PIP4kγ is a substrate for mTORC1 that maintains basal mTORC1 signaling during starvation,25372051,10.1126/scisignal.2005191,"Phosphatidylinositol-5-phosphate 4-kinases (PIP4ks) are a family of lipid kinases that specifically use phosphatidylinositol 5-monophosphate (PI-5-P) as a substrate to synthesize phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2]. Suppression of PIP4k function in Drosophila results in smaller cells and reduced target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) signaling. We showed that the γ isoform of PIP4k stimulated signaling through mammalian TORC1 (mTORC1). Knockdown of PIP4kγ reduced cell mass in cells in which mTORC1 is constitutively activated by Tsc2 deficiency. In Tsc2 null cells, mTORC1 activation was partially independent of amino acids or glucose and glutamine. PIP4kγ knockdown inhibited the nutrient-independent activation of mTORC1 in Tsc2 knockdown cells and reduced basal mTORC1 signaling in wild-type cells. PIP4kγ was phosphorylated by mTORC1 and associated with the complex. Phosphorylated PIP4kγ was enriched in light microsomal vesicles, whereas the unphosphorylated form was enriched in heavy microsomal vesicles associated with the Golgi. Furthermore, basal mTORC1 signaling was enhanced by overexpression of unphosphorylated wild-type PIP4kγ or a phosphorylation-defective mutant and decreased by overexpression of a phosphorylation-mimetic mutant. Together, these results demonstrate that PIP4kγ and mTORC1 interact in a self-regulated feedback loop to maintain low and tightly regulated mTORC1 activation during starvation.",2014,"Deborah A Sarkes, Lucia E Rameh, Ian Bettencourt, John M Asara, Ashley M Mackey"

Localization of DvirIII in the pericentromeric regions of chromosomes and in the telomeric region of chromosome 5 was observed in both species. Moreover, species specificity in the localization of DNA sequences of DvirIII in some chromosomal regions was detected. In order to study the three-dimensional organization of pericentromeric heterochromatin region of polytene chromosomes of ovarian nurse cells of D. virilis and D. kanekoi, 3D FISH DvirIII was performed with nurse cells of these species.

Despite a large body of work, little is known how exocyst function is controlled. To identify regulators for exocyst function, we performed a targeted RNA interference (RNAi) screen in Caenorhabditis elegans to uncover kinases and phosphatases that genetically interact with the exocyst. We identified seven kinase and seven phosphatase genes that display enhanced phenotypes when combined with hypomorphic alleles of exoc-7 (exo70), exoc-8 (exo84), or an exoc-7;exoc-8 double mutant. We show that in line with its reported role in exocytotic membrane trafficking, a defective exoc-8 caused accumulation of exocytotic soluble NSF attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins in both intestinal and neuronal cells in C. elegans. Down-regulation of the phosphatase protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) phosphatase regulatory subunit sur-6/B55 gene resulted in accumulation of exocytic SNARE proteins SNB-1 and SNAP-29 in wild-type and in exoc-8 mutant animals. In contrast, RNAi of the kinase par-1 caused reduced intracellular green fluorescent protein signal for the same proteins. Double RNAi experiments for par-1, pkc-3, and sur-6/B55 in C. elegans suggest a possible cooperation and involvement in postembryo lethality, developmental timing, as well as SNARE protein trafficking. Functional analysis of the homologous kinases and phosphatases in Drosophila median neurosecretory cells showed that atypical protein kinase C kinase and phosphatase PP2A regulate exocyst-dependent, insulin-like peptide secretion. Collectively, these results characterize kinases and phosphatases implicated in the regulation of exocyst function, and suggest the possibility for interplay between the par-1 and pkc-3 kinases and the PP2A phosphatase regulatory subunit sur-6 in this process.",2014,"Ville Hietakangas, Lois Tang, Kiran Hasygar, Yaming Jiu, Yanbo Liu, Jussi Jäntti, Thomas R Bürglin, Carina I Holmberg"

Similar to female GSCs, BALL is required to maintain self-renewal of male GSCs, suggesting a tissue independent requirement of BALL for self-renewal of germline stem cells.",2014,"Kathrin Klinge, Herbert Jäckle, Alf Herzig, Ufuk Günesdogan, Toma A Yakulov, Bettina Herzig"
"Id proteins: small molecules, mighty regulators",25248477,10.1016/B978-0-12-405943-6.00005-1,"The family of inhibitor of differentiation (Id) proteins is a group of evolutionarily conserved molecules, which play important regulatory roles in organisms ranging from Drosophila to humans. Id proteins are small polypeptides harboring a helix-loop-helix (HLH) motif, which are best known to mediate dimerization with other basic HLH proteins, primarily E proteins. Because Id proteins do not possess the basic amino acids adjacent to the HLH motif necessary for DNA binding, Id proteins inhibit the function of E protein homodimers, as well as heterodimers between E proteins and tissue-specific bHLH proteins. However, Id proteins have also been shown to have E protein-independent functions. The Id genes are broadly but differentially expressed in a variety of cell types. Transcription of the Id genes is controlled by transcription factors such as C/EBPβ and Egr as well as by signaling pathways triggered by different stimuli, which include bone morphogenic proteins, cytokines, and ligands of T cell receptors. In general, Id proteins are capable of inhibiting the differentiation of progenitors of different cell types, promoting cell-cycle progression, delaying cellular senescence, and facilitating cell migration. These properties of Id proteins enable them to play significant roles in stem cell maintenance, vasculogenesis, tumorigenesis and metastasis, the development of the immune system, and energy metabolism. In this review, we intend to highlight the current understanding of the function of Id proteins and discuss gaps in our knowledge about the mechanisms whereby Id proteins exert their diverse effects in multiple cellular processes.",2014,"Flora Ling, Xiao-Hong Sun, Bin Kang"
Hybridization occurs between Drosophila simulans and D. sechellia in the Seychelles archipelago,24773151,10.1111/jeb.12391,"Drosophila simulans and D. sechellia are sister species that serve as a model to study the evolution of reproductive isolation.

We surveyed the relative frequency of males from these two species in a variety of substrates found on five islands of the Seychelles archipelago. We sampled different fruits and found that putative D. simulans can be found in a variety of substrates, including, surprisingly, M. citrifolia. Putative D. sechellia was found preferentially on M. citrifolia fruits, but a small proportion was found in other substrates. Our survey also shows the existence of putative hybrid males in areas where D. simulans is present in Seychelles.

A screen for F1 hybrid male rescue reveals no major-effect hybrid lethality loci in the Drosophila melanogaster autosomal genome,25352540,10.1534/g3.114.014076,"Hybrid sons between Drosophila melanogaster females and D. simulans males die as 3rd instar larvae. Two genes, D. melanogaster Hybrid male rescue (Hmr) on the X chromosome, and D. simulans Lethal hybrid rescue (Lhr) on chromosome II, interact to cause this lethality. Loss-of-function mutations in either gene suppress lethality, but several pieces of evidence suggest that additional factors are required for hybrid lethality. Here we screen the D. melanogaster autosomal genome by using the Bloomington Stock Center Deficiency kit to search for additional regions that can rescue hybrid male lethality. Our screen is designed to identify putative hybrid incompatibility (HI) genes similar to Hmr and Lhr which, when removed, are dominant suppressors of lethality. After screening 89% of the autosomal genome, we found no regions that rescue males to the adult stage. We did, however, identify several regions that rescue up to 13% of males to the pharate adult stage. This weak rescue suggests the presence of multiple minor-effect HI loci, but we were unable to map these loci to high resolution, presumably because weak rescue can be masked by genetic background effects. We attempted to test one candidate, the dosage compensation gene male specific lethal-3 (msl-3), by using RNA interference with short hairpin microRNA constructs targeted specifically against D. simulans msl-3 but failed to achieve knockdown, in part due to off-target effects. We conclude that the D. melanogaster autosomal genome likely does not contain additional major-effect HI loci. We also show that Hmr is insufficient to fully account for the lethality associated with the D. melanogaster X chromosome, suggesting that additional X-linked genes contribute to hybrid lethality.",2014,"Suna Park, Derek M Clay, Nathaniel B Edelman, Neil Parekh, Daniel A Barbash, Erin A Nuzzo, Ling-Hei Li, Shuqing Ji, P Satyaki, Tawny N Cuykendall, Alexandra Kimchy"

Notch controls cell adhesion in the Drosophila eye,24415957,10.1371/journal.pgen.1004087,"Sporadic evidence suggests Notch is involved in cell adhesion. However, the underlying mechanism is unknown. Here I have investigated an epithelial remodeling process in the Drosophila eye in which two primary pigment cells (PPCs) with a characteristic 'kidney' shape enwrap and eventually isolate a group of cone cells from inter-ommatidial cells (IOCs). This paper shows that in the developing Drosophila eye the ligand Delta was transcribed in cone cells and Notch was activated in the adjacent PPC precursors. In the absence of Notch, emerging PPCs failed to enwrap cone cells, and hibris (hbs) and sns, two genes coding for adhesion molecules of the Nephrin group that mediate preferential adhesion, were not transcribed in PPC precursors. Conversely, activation of Notch in single IOCs led to ectopic expression of hbs and sns. By contrast, in a single IOC that normally transcribes rst, a gene coding for an adhesion molecule of the Neph1 group that binds Hbs and Sns, activation of Notch led to a loss of rst transcription. In addition, in a Notch mutant where two emerging PPCs failed to enwrap cone cells, expression of hbs in PPC precursors restored the ability of these cells to surround cone cells. Further, expression of hbs or rst in a single rst- or hbs-expressing cell, respectively, led to removal of the counterpart from the membrane within the same cell through cis-interaction and forced expression of Rst in all hbs-expressing PPCs strongly disrupted the remodeling process. Finally, a loss of both hbs and sns in single PPC precursors led to constriction of the apical surface that compromised the 'kidney' shape of PPCs. Taken together, these results indicate that cone cells utilize Notch signaling to instruct neighboring PPC precursors to surround them and Notch controls the remodeling process by differentially regulating four adhesion genes.",2014,Sujin Bao
Integrating the interactome and the transcriptome of Drosophila,24913703,10.1186/1471-2105-15-177,"Background: Networks of interacting genes and gene products mediate most cellular and developmental processes. High throughput screening methods combined with literature curation are identifying many of the protein-protein interactions (PPI) and protein-DNA interactions (PDI) that constitute these networks. Most of the detection methods, however, fail to identify the in vivo spatial or temporal context of the interactions. Thus, the interaction data are a composite of the individual networks that may operate in specific tissues or developmental stages. Genome-wide expression data may be useful for filtering interaction data to identify the subnetworks that operate in specific spatial or temporal contexts. Here we take advantage of the extensive interaction and expression data available for Drosophila to analyze how interaction networks may be unique to specific tissues and developmental stages. Results: We ranked genes on a scale from ubiquitously expressed to tissue or stage specific and examined their interaction patterns. Interestingly, ubiquitously expressed genes have many more interactions among themselves than do non-ubiquitously expressed genes both in PPI and PDI networks. While the PDI network is enriched for interactions between tissue-specific transcription factors and their tissue-specific targets, a preponderance of the PDI interactions are between ubiquitous and non-ubiquitously expressed genes and proteins. In contrast to PDI, PPI networks are depleted for interactions among tissue- or stage- specific proteins, which instead interact primarily with widely expressed proteins. In light of these findings, we present an approach to filter interaction data based on gene expression levels normalized across tissues or developmental stages. We show that this filter (the percent maximum or pmax filter) can be used to identify subnetworks that function within individual tissues or developmental stages. Conclusions: These observations suggest that protein networks are frequently organized into hubs of widely expressed proteins to which are attached various tissue- or stage-specific proteins. This is consistent with earlier analyses of human PPI data and suggests a similar organization of interaction networks across species. This organization implies that tissue or stage specific networks can be best identified from interactome data by using filters designed to include both ubiquitously expressed and specifically expressed genes and proteins.",2014,"Russell L Finley Jr, Thilakam Murali, Svetlana Pacifico"
Model-based analysis for qualitative data: an application in Drosophila germline stem cell regulation,24626201,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003498,"Discovery in developmental biology is often driven by intuition that relies on the integration of multiple types of data such as fluorescent images, phenotypes, and the outcomes of biochemical assays. Mathematical modeling helps elucidate the biological mechanisms at play as the networks become increasingly large and complex. However, the available data is frequently under-utilized due to incompatibility with quantitative model tuning techniques. This is the case for stem cell regulation mechanisms explored in the Drosophila germarium through fluorescent immunohistochemistry. To enable better integration of biological data with modeling in this and similar situations, we have developed a general parameter estimation process to quantitatively optimize models with qualitative data. The process employs a modified version of the Optimal Scaling method from social and behavioral sciences, and multi-objective optimization to evaluate the trade-off between fitting different datasets (e.g. wild type vs. mutant). Using only published imaging data in the germarium, we first evaluated support for a published intracellular regulatory network by considering alternative connections of the same regulatory players. Simply screening networks against wild type data identified hundreds of feasible alternatives. Of these, five parsimonious variants were found and compared by multi-objective analysis including mutant data and dynamic constraints. With these data, the current model is supported over the alternatives, but support for a biochemically observed feedback element is weak (i.e. these data do not measure the feedback effect well). When also comparing new hypothetical models, the available data do not discriminate. To begin addressing the limitations in data, we performed a model-based experiment design and provide recommendations for experiments to refine model parameters and discriminate increasingly complex hypotheses.",2014,"Michael Pargett, David M Umulis, Gregery T Buzzard, Ann E Rundell"
Oxidative stress is not a major contributor to somatic mitochondrial DNA mutations,24516391,10.1371/journal.pgen.1003974,"The accumulation of somatic mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations is implicated in aging and common diseases of the elderly, including cancer and neurodegenerative disease. However, the mechanisms that influence the frequency of somatic mtDNA mutations are poorly understood. To develop a simple invertebrate model system to address this matter, we used the Random Mutation Capture (RMC) assay to characterize the age-dependent frequency and distribution of mtDNA mutations in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Because oxidative stress is a major suspect in the age-dependent accumulation of somatic mtDNA mutations, we also used the RMC assay to explore the influence of oxidative stress on the somatic mtDNA mutation frequency. We found that many of the features associated with mtDNA mutations in vertebrates are conserved in Drosophila, including a comparable somatic mtDNA mutation frequency (∼10(-5)), an increased frequency of mtDNA mutations with age, and a prevalence of transition mutations. Only a small fraction of the mtDNA mutations detected in young or old animals were G∶C to T∶A transversions, a signature of oxidative damage, and loss-of-function mutations in the mitochondrial superoxide dismutase, Sod2, had no detectable influence on the somatic mtDNA mutation frequency. Moreover, a loss-of-function mutation in Ogg1, which encodes a DNA repair enzyme that removes oxidatively damaged deoxyguanosine residues (8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine), did not significantly influence the somatic mtDNA mutation frequency of Sod2 mutants. Together, these findings indicate that oxidative stress is not a major cause of somatic mtDNA mutations. Our data instead suggests that somatic mtDNA mutations arise primarily from errors that occur during mtDNA replication. Further studies using Drosophila should aid in the identification of factors that influence the frequency of somatic mtDNA mutations.",2014,"Edward J Fox, Monica Sanchez-Contreras, Selina Yu, Leslie S Itsara, Fernando Cardozo-Pelaez, Scott R Kennedy, Leo J Pallanck, Joshua J Hewitt"
Octopamine neuromodulation regulates Gr32a-linked aggression and courtship pathways in Drosophila males,24852170,10.1371/journal.pgen.1004356,"Chemosensory pheromonal information regulates aggression and reproduction in many species, but how pheromonal signals are transduced to reliably produce behavior is not well understood. Here we demonstrate that the pheromonal signals detected by Gr32a-expressing chemosensory neurons to enhance male aggression are filtered through octopamine (OA, invertebrate equivalent of norepinephrine) neurons. Using behavioral assays, we find males lacking both octopamine and Gr32a gustatory receptors exhibit parallel delays in the onset of aggression and reductions in aggression. Physiological and anatomical experiments identify Gr32a to octopamine neuron synaptic and functional connections in the suboesophageal ganglion. Refining the Gr32a-expressing population indicates that mouth Gr32a neurons promote male aggression and form synaptic contacts with OA neurons. By restricting the monoamine neuron target population, we show that three previously identified OA-Fru(M) neurons involved in behavioral choice are among the Gr32a-OA connections. Our findings demonstrate that octopaminergic neuromodulatory neurons function as early as a second-order step in this chemosensory-driven male social behavior pathway.",2014,"Jonathan C Andrews, Greg P Leary, Michael P Kavanaugh, Edward A Kravitz, Qin Yu, María Paz Fernández, Sarah J Certel, Adelaine K W Leung"

These properties were used to show that Spdo is sorted toward late endosomes in a Numb-dependent manner.

Metal targets were designed for two-dimensional MSI of the surface of 3-D biological objects. Targets with either simple grooves or profiled holes designed to accurately accommodate the male and female bodies were fabricated. These grooves and especially holes ensured correct height fixation and spatial orientation of the flies on the targets after matrix application and sample drying. For LDI-TOF to be used, the flies were arranged into holes and fixed to a plane of the target using fast-setting glue. In MALDI-TOF mode, the flies were fixed as above and sprayed with a lithium 2,5-dihydroxybenzoate matrix using up to 100 airbrush spray cycles. The scanning electron microscopy images revealed that the deposits of matrix were homogenous and the matrix formed mostly into the clusters of crystals (40-80 µm) that were separated from each other by an uncovered cuticle surface (30-40 µm). The MSI using target with profiled holes provided superior results to the targets with simple grooves, eliminating the ion suppression/mass deviation due to the 3-D shape of the flies. Attention was paid to neutral lipids and other compounds including the male anti-attractant 11-cis-vaccenyl acetate for which the expected distribution with high concentration on the tip of the male abdomen was confirmed.

This is of particular relevance in neuroscience since the dynamics of intracellular Ca(2+) concentrations represents a faithful correlate for neuronal activity, and optical Ca(2+) imaging is commonly used to monitor spatiotemporal activity across populations of neurons. In this respect Drosophila provides a favorable model organism due to the sophisticated genetic tools that facilitate the targeted expression of fluorescent Ca(2+) sensor proteins.

This analysis permits a detailed morphological and temporal description of nuclear and cytoskeletal events in normal or drug-injected embryos.",2014,"Barbara Fasulo, William Sullivan"
A tissue specific cytochrome P450 required for the structure and function of Drosophila sensory organs,15327788,10.1016/j.mod.2004.04.017,"Cytochrome P450s have generally been acknowledged as broadly tuned detoxifying enzymes. However, emerging evidence argues P450s have an integral role in cell signaling and developmental processes, via their metabolism of retinoic acid, arachidonic acid, steroids, and other cellular ligands. To study the morphogenesis of Drosophila sensory organs, we examined mutants with impaired mechanosensation and discovered one, nompH, encodes the cytochrome P450 CYP303a1. We now report the characterization of nompH, a mutant defective in the function of peripheral chemo- and mechanoreceptor cells, and demonstrate CYP303a1 is essential for the development and structure of external sensory organs which mediate the reception of vital mechanosensory and chemosensory stimuli. Notably this P450 is expressed only in sensory bristles, localizing in the apical region of the socket cell. The wide diversity of the P450 family and the growing number of P450s with developmental phenotypes suggests the exquisite tissue and subcellular specificity of CYP303a1 illustrates an important aspect of P450 function; namely, a strategy to process critical developmental signals in a tissue- and cell-specific manner.",2004,"Thomas Keil, Aarron T Willingham"
Approach for functional analysis of glycan using RNA interference,15467401,10.1023/B:GLYC.0000043750.80389.14,"The elucidation of the biological role of glycan is one of the most important issues to be resolved following the genome project. RNA interference is becoming an efficient reverse genetic tool for studying gene function in model organisms, including C.elegans and Drosophila melanogaster. Our molecular evolutionary study has shown that a prototype of glycosyltransferases, which synthesize a variety of glycan structures in the Golgi apparatus, was conserved between mammals and Drosophila. For analyses of the basic physiological functions of glycans, we established the Drosophila inducible RNAi knockdown system and applied it to one glycosyltransferase and one transporter, proteoglycan UDP-galactose: beta-xylose beta1,4galactosyltransferase I and the PAPS-transporter, respectively. If on the silencing of each gene induced ubiquitously under the control of a cytoplasmic actin promoter, the RNAi knockdown fly died, then the protein was indispensable for life. The expression of the target gene was disrupted specifically and the degree of interference was well correlated with the phenotype. The inducible RNAi knockdown fly obtained using the GAL4-UAS system will pave the way for the functional analysis of glycans.",2004,"Hideki Ishida, Mitsuru Nakamura, Hidenao Toyoda, Satoshi Goto, Ryu Ueda, Shoko Nishihara"
Follicle separation during Drosophila oogenesis requires the activity of the kinesin II-associated polypeptide Kap in germline cells,15088066,10.1038/sj.embor.7400141,"Cellular localization of organelles, protein complexes and single mRNAs depends on the directed transport along microtubule tracks, a process mediated by ATP-driven molecular motor proteins of the dynein and kinesin superfamilies. Kinesin II is a heterotrimeric protein complex composed of two motor subunits and a unique nonmotor Kinesin-associated protein (Kap). Kap was shown to transport both particulate cargo, as axoneme components in rafts, and membrane-bounded organelles such as melanosomes. Drosophila Kinesin II was shown to be essential for the axonal transport of choline acetyltransferase in a specific set of neurons. We have generated Kap mutants and show that gene activity is not only required for neuronal function but also for separation of follicles during early oogenesis. The data suggest that Kap participates in the transport of signalling components required for instructive interactions between germline and soma cells.",2004,"Ulrich Schäfer, Annette Peter, Herbert Jäckle, Ralf Pflanz"
Expression and functional significance of mouse paraspeckle protein 1 on spermatogenesis,15140795,10.1095/biolreprod.104.028159,"Paraspeckle protein 1 (PSP1) in humans is a recently identified component protein of a novel nuclear body, paraspeckle. The protein has a DBHS (Drosophila behavior, human splicing) motif that is found in PSF and p54(nrb)/NonO proteins. These DBHS-containing proteins have been reported to be involved in various nuclear events such as DNA replication, transcription, and mRNA processing. Here we show that mouse paraspeckle protein 1 (mPSP1; encoded by the Pspc1 gene) has two isoforms with different C-termini lengths. Abundant expression of the longer isoform (mPSP1-alpha) and the shorter one (mPSP1-beta) were observed in testis and kidney, respectively. Transiently expressed mPSP1-alpha was localized in nuclei, but mPSP1-beta was localized in both nuclei and cytoplasm. These observations suggest that alternative splicing regulates tissue distribution and subcellular localization. Like other DBHS-containing proteins, mPSP1 has RNA-binding activity. In mouse testis, mPSP1-alpha was found in the nuclear matrix fraction. Furthermore, by coimmunoprecipitation, we confirmed that mPSP1 interacts with other DBHS-containing proteins, PSF and p54(nrb)/NonO. Therefore, we conclude that mPSP1 may regulate multiple phases of important nuclear events during spermatogenesis.",2004,"Yasuyuki Kurihara, Tomohiko Yasaki, Seiichi Uesugi, Reiko Myojin, Takayuki Sakurai, Takahito Matsunaga, Sho Kuwahara, Minoru Kimura"
Dissection of DIAP1 functional domains via a mutant replacement strategy,15371434,10.1074/jbc.M409691200,"Inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) act as endogenous inhibitors of active caspases. Drosophila IAP1 (DIAP1) activity is required to keep cells from undergoing apoptosis. The central cell death regulators Reaper and Hid induce apoptosis very rapidly by inhibiting DIAP1 function. We have developed a system for replacing endogenous DIAP1 with mutant forms of the protein, allowing us to examine the roles of various domains of the protein in living and dying cells. We found that DIAP1 is cleaved by a caspase early after the initiation of apoptosis. This cleavage is required for DIAP1 degradation, but Rpr and Hid can still initiate apoptosis in the absence of cleavage. The cleavage of DIAP1 promotes DIAP1 degradation in a manner dependent on the function of the ubiquitin ligase function of the DIAP1 ring domain. This ring domain function is required for Hid-induced apoptosis. We propose a model that synthesizes our data with those of other laboratories and provide a consistent model for DIAP1 function in living and dying cells.",2004,"Kristin White, Neda Huseinovic, Simonetta Lisi, Peter Bangs, Eltyeb Abdelwahid, Takakazu Yokokura, Doug Dresnek"
[Evolutionary development of the immunoglobulins super family],15131974,,"The origin of the ability of immunoglobulins (Igs) and T-cell receptors (TCRs) to specifically recognize antigens is related to the evolutionary development of proteins of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF). The IgSF proteins are characterized by specific domain organization of molecules and statistically significant homology with known Igs. Four types of Ig domains (V1, V2, C1, and C2), differing from one another both in variations in their spatial organization and in the number of amino acid residues, have been distinguished. Immunoglobulin superfamily comprises Igs; TCRs; class I and II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules; one-domain proteins of thymocytes and T-cells (Thy-1); myelin protein P0; beta 2-microglobulin; two-domain proteins--sponge receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), sponge adhesive protein (SAP), Drosophila tyrosine-kinase receptor (DTKR), cortical-thymocyte receptors of Xenopus (CTX), human (CTH), etc.; and a large group of adhesins, coreceptors, and Ig receptors with varying number of domains. Evolutionary development of IgSF began with the origination of chaperones, Thy-1, and P0 of prokaryotes and unicellular eukaryotes. Mutations, duplications, and translocations of genes controlling both V and C domains yielded proteins differing in the number and combination of these domains. All IgSF proteins are divided into two groups. The first group includes the proteins with nonrearranging V2 domains and homophilic mode of interaction; the second, the proteins with rearranging V1 domains and heterophilic mode of interaction (Igs, TCRs). The acquisition of the capability of heterophilic antigen-binding mode of interaction was apparently related to the introduction of recombination-activating retroviral genes (RAG1 and RAG2) into the genome of Gnathostomata ancestors.",2004,V G Galaktionov
Identification of a novel Sertoli cell gene product SERT that influences follicle stimulating hormone actions,14693373,10.1016/j.gene.2003.09.035,"Sertoli cells provide the cytoarchitectural support and microenvironment necessary for the process of spermatogenesis and have a central role in male sex determination. Characterization of Sertoli cell specific gene products provides insight into the unique functions of this testicular cell type. The current study reports the identification of a novel Sertoli cell gene product that is termed Sertoli cell specific gene (SERT). The SERT cDNA sequence shows no homology to any of the known gene sequences in the GenBank database. Some homology was found with short sequences in the expressed sequence tag (EST) database. A motif analysis demonstrates a signature to an RNA binding protein sex lethal (sx1) involved in Drosophila sex determination. The expression pattern of SERT was examined with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Northern blot analysis. SERT expression was found to be specific to the testis and absent in other tissues examined. In the testis, the approximate 1.5-kb SERT transcript was localized to the Sertoli cells. A 1.1-kb spliced form of SERT was also identified by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis. The genomic structure analysis demonstrates the presence of at least three exons with 85% sequence homology between mouse and rat sequences. Treatment of cultured Sertoli cells with follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) significantly increased the expression of SERT mRNA levels. The potential role of SERT in Sertoli cell function was investigated with the use of a transferrin promoter reporter construct. Transferrin expression is a marker of Sertoli cell differentiated function. An antisense oligonucleotide to SERT significantly inhibited FSH and cAMP induced transferrin promoter activation, while control oligonucleotides had no effect. In summary, a novel gene product expressed primarily by Sertoli cells, SERT, was identified with a potential RNA binding protein motif similar to sex lethal that appears to have a role in maintaining hormone (e.g. FSH) actions in Sertoli cells.",2004,"Jaideep Chaudhary, Ingrid Sadler-Riggleman, Michael K Skinner"
A FADD-dependent innate immune mechanism in mammalian cells,15549108,10.1038/nature03124,"Vertebrate innate immunity provides a first line of defence against pathogens such as viruses and bacteria. Viral infection activates a potent innate immune response, which can be triggered by double-stranded (ds)RNA produced during viral replication. Here, we report that mammalian cells lacking the death-domain-containing protein FADD are defective in intracellular dsRNA-activated gene expression, including production of type I (alpha/beta) interferons, and are thus very susceptible to viral infection. The signalling pathway incorporating FADD is largely independent of Toll-like receptor 3 and the dsRNA-dependent kinase PKR, but seems to require receptor interacting protein 1 as well as Tank-binding kinase 1-mediated activation of the transcription factor IRF-3. The requirement for FADD in mammalian host defence is evocative of innate immune signalling in Drosophila, in which a FADD-dependent pathway responds to bacterial infection by activating the transcription of antimicrobial genes. These data therefore suggest the existence of a conserved pathogen recognition pathway in mammalian cells that is essential for the optimal induction of type I interferons and other genes important for host defence.",2004,"Siddharth Balachandran, Emmanuel Thomas, Glen N Barber"
Evolutionary expressed sequence tag analysis of Drosophila female reproductive tracts identifies genes subjected to positive selection,15579698,10.1534/genetics.104.030478,"Genes whose products are involved in reproduction include some of the fastest-evolving genes found within the genomes of several organisms. Drosophila has long been used to study the function and evolutionary dynamics of genes thought to be involved in sperm competition and sexual conflict, two processes that have been hypothesized to drive the adaptive evolution of reproductive molecules. Several seminal fluid proteins (Acps) made in the Drosophila male reproductive tract show evidence of rapid adaptive evolution. To identify candidate genes in the female reproductive tract that may be involved in female-male interactions and that may thus have been subjected to adaptive evolution, we used an evolutionary bioinformatics approach to analyze sequences from a cDNA library that we have generated from Drosophila female reproductive tracts. We further demonstrate that several of these genes have been subjected to positive selection. Their expression in female reproductive tracts, presence of signal sequences/transmembrane domains, and rapid adaptive evolution indicate that they are prime candidates to encode female reproductive molecules that interact with rapidly evolving male Acps.",2004,"Willie J Swanson, Mariana F Wolfner, Alex Wong, Charles F Aquadro"

Polyamides have been shown to regulate gene expression in simple in vitro systems using defined DNA templates and nuclear extracts as a source of the transcriptional machinery. Activation of gene expression has also been achieved in vitro with polyamide-activator peptide conjugates. Most importantly, polyamides are cell permeable and localize in the nucleus in various cultured cell lines and are capable of down regulating target genes in these cells.

In this study we identify the EHD/Rme-1/Pincher family of endocytic proteins as Numb interacting partners in mammals and Drosophila. The EHD/Rme-1 proteins function in recycling of plasma membrane receptors internalized by both clathrin-mediated endocytosis and a clathrin-independent pathway regulated by ADP ribosylation factor 6 (Arf6).

Immunoglobulin superfamily receptors in protochordates: before RAG time,15199966,10.1111/j.0105-2896.2004.00122.x,"Urochordates and cephalochordates do not have an adaptive immune system involving the somatic rearrangement of their antigen receptor genes. They do not have antigen-presenting molecules of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-linked class I and II types. In the absence of such a system, the status of their genes reflects perhaps a primitive pre-recombination-activating gene (RAG) stage that could suggest the pathway leading to the genesis of the T-cell receptor (TCR) and antibodies. In the genome of Ciona intestinalis, genes that encode molecules with membrane receptor features have been found among many members of the immunoglobulin superfamily (Igsf). They use the domains typical of vertebrate antigen receptors and class I and II: the V, and C1-like domains. These genes belong to two families with recognizable homologs in vertebrates: the junctional adhesion molecule (JAM)/cortical thymocyte marker of Xenopus (CTX) family and the nectin family. The human homologs of these genes segregate in a single unit of four paralogous segments on chromosomes 1q, 3q, 11p, and 21q. These regions contain nowadays several genes involved in the adaptive immune system, and some related members are present in the MHC paralogs as well. They also contain receptor-like genes without homologs in Ciona but with related members in the protostome Drosophila. It looks as if in Ciona one detects what looks like the 'fossil' of one group of genes bound to duplicate and give rise to many crucial elements of the adaptive immune system. The modern homologs of these JAM, CTX, and nectins are all or almost all virus receptors, and the hypothesis is formulated that this property was taken advantage of during evolution to participate in the elaboration of either or both the somatically generated antigen-recognizing receptors and the antigen-presenting molecules.",2004,"Rosaria De Santis, Louis Du Pasquier, Ivana Zucchetti"
Human Dlg protein binds to the envelope glycoproteins of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 and regulates envelope mediated cell-cell fusion in T lymphocytes,15286176,10.1242/jcs.01266,"Human homologue of the Drosophila Dlg tumor suppressor (hDlg) is a widely expressed scaffold protein implicated in the organization of multi-protein complexes at cell adhesion sites such as the neuronal synapse. hDlg contains three PDZ domains that mediate its binding to the consensus motifs present at the C-termini of various cell surface proteins, thus inducing their clustering and/or stabilization at the plasma membrane. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified hDlg as a cellular binding partner of a viral membrane integral protein, the envelope glycoprotein (Env) of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1). HTLV-1 is a human retrovirus that infects CD4+ T lymphocytes and is preferentially transmitted via direct contacts between infected and target cells, through a structure referred to as the virological synapse. Here, we demonstrate that hDlg interacts with a classical PDZ domain-binding motif present at the C-terminus of the cytoplasmic domain of HTLV-1 Env and conserved in the related HTLV-2 virus. We further document that, in HTLV-1 infected primary T cells, hDlg and Env are concentrated in restricted areas of the plasma membrane, enriched in molecules involved in T-cell contacts. The presence of Gag proteins responsible for viral assembly and budding in these areas indicated that they constitute platforms for viral assembly and transmission. Finally, a mutant virus unable to bind hDlg exhibited a decreased ability to trigger Env mediated cell fusion between T lymphocytes. We thus propose that hDlg stabilizes HTLV-1 envelope glycoproteins at the virological synapse formed between infected and target cells, hence assisting the cell-to-cell transmission of the virus.",2004,"Fabien Perugi, Claudine Pique, Marie-Christine Dokhélar, Vincent Blot, Danielle Pham, Toshihiko Hanada, Serge Bénichou, Athar H Chishti, Lélia Delamarre, Richard Benarous"
Modulation of notch processing by gamma-secretase inhibitors causes intestinal goblet cell metaplasia and induction of genes known to specify gut secretory lineage differentiation,15319485,10.1093/toxsci/kfh254,"It is anticipated that gamma-secretase inhibitors (gamma-Sec-I) that modulate Notch processing will alter differentiation in tissues whose architecture is governed by Notch signaling. To explore this hypothesis, Han Wistar rats were dosed for up to 5 days with 10-100 micromol/kg b.i.d. gamma-Sec-I from three chemical series that inhibit Notch processing in vitro at various potencies (Notch IC(50)). These included an arylsulfonamide (AS) (142 nM), a dibenzazepine (DBZ) (1.7 nM), and a benzodiazepine (BZ) (2.2 nM). The DBZ and BZ caused dose-dependent intestinal goblet cell metaplasia. In contrast, the AS produced no detectable in vivo toxicity, despite higher exposure to free drug. In a time course using BZ, small intestinal crypt cell and large intestinal glandular cell epithelial apoptosis was observed on days 1-5, followed by goblet cell metaplasia on days 2-5 and crypt epithelial and glandular epithelial regenerative hyperplasia on days 4-5. Gene expression profiling of duodenal samples from BZ-dosed animals revealed significant time-dependent deregulation of mRNAs for various panendocrine, hormonal, and transcription factor genes.

Genetic analysis of contributions of dorsal group and JAK-Stat92E pathway genes to larval hemocyte concentration and the egg encapsulation response in Drosophila,15082553,10.1534/genetics.166.3.1343,"Drosophila larvae defend themselves against parasitoid wasps by completely surrounding the egg with layers of specialized hemocytes called lamellocytes. Similar capsules of lamellocytes, called melanotic capsules, are also formed around ""self"" tissues in larvae carrying gain-of-function mutations in Toll and hopscotch. Constitutive differentiation of lamellocytes in larvae carrying these mutations is accompanied by high concentrations of plasmatocytes, the major hemocyte class in uninfected control larvae. The relative contributions of hemocyte concentration vs. lamellocyte differentiation to wasp egg encapsulation are not known. To address this question, we used Leptopilina boulardi to infect more than a dozen strains of host larvae harboring a wide range of hemocyte densities. We report a significant correlation between hemocyte concentration and encapsulation capacity among wild-type larvae and larvae heterozygous for mutations in the Hopscotch-Stat92E and Toll-Dorsal pathways. Larvae carrying loss-of-function mutations in Hopscotch, Stat92E, or dorsal group genes exhibit significant reduction in encapsulation capacity. Larvae carrying loss-of-function mutations in dorsal group genes (including Toll and tube) have reduced hemocyte concentrations, whereas larvae deficient in Hopscotch-Stat92E signaling do not. Surprisingly, unlike hopscotch mutants, Toll and tube mutants are not compromised in their ability to generate lamellocytes. Our results suggest that circulating hemocyte concentration and lamellocyte differentiation constitute two distinct physiological requirements of wasp egg encapsulation and Toll and Hopscotch proteins serve distinct roles in this process.",2004,"Jonathan P Melk, Shubha Govind, Richard Paul Sorrentino"

The drop in enzymatic activity of complex I in the mutant strain is associated with a 50% decrease in the quantity of constitutive proteins of the complex. Moreover, in the mutant strain there is a 50% decrease in the steady-state concentration of the transcripts of the mitochondrial genes affected by the deletion.

Increased expression of Drosophila Su(var)3-7 triggers Su(var)3-9-dependent heterochromatin formation,15564384,10.1242/jcs.01549,"The Su(var)3-7 protein is essential for fly viability, and several lines of evidence support its key importance in heterochromatin formation: it binds to pericentric heterochromatin, it potently suppresses variegation and it interacts with HP1. However, the mode of action of Su(var)3-7 is poorly understood. Here we investigate in vivo the consequences of increased Su(var)3-7 expression on fly viability and chromatin structure. A large excess of Su(var)3-7 induces lethality, whereas lower doses permit survival and cause spectacular changes in the morphology of polytene chromosomes in males, and to a lesser extent in females. The male X is always the most affected chromosome: it becomes highly condensed and shortened, and its characteristic banding pattern is modified. In addition, Su(var)3-7 was found over the complete length of all chromosomes. This event coincides with the appearance of heterochromatin markers such as histone H3K9 dimethylation and HP1 at many sites on autosomes and, more strikingly, on the male X chromosome. These two features are strictly dependent on the histone-methyltransferase Su(var)3-9, whereas the generalised localisation of Su(var)3-7 is not. These data provide evidence for a dose-dependent regulatory role of Su(var)3-7 in chromosome morphology and heterochromatin formation. Moreover they show that Su(var)3-7 expression is sufficient to induce Su(var)3-9-dependent ectopic heterochromatinisation and suggest a functional link between Su(var)3-7 and the histone-methyltransferase Su(var)3-9.",2004,"Yannis Jaquet, Anne Spierer, Pierre Spierer, Marion Delattre"
Oncogenic activation of c-Myb correlates with a loss of negative regulation by TIF1beta and Ski,14761981,10.1074/jbc.M313069200,"The c-myb proto-oncogene product (c-Myb) regulates proliferation of hematopoietic cells by inducing the transcription of a group of target genes. Removal or mutations of the negative regulatory domain (NRD) in the C-terminal half of c-Myb leads to increased transactivating capacity and oncogenic activation. Here we report that TIF1beta directly binds to the NRD and negatively regulates the c-Myb-dependent trans-activation. In addition, three corepressors (Ski, N-CoR, and mSin3A) bind to the DNA-binding domain of c-Myb together with TIF1beta and recruit the histone deacetylase complex to c-Myb. Furthermore, the Drosophila TIF1beta homolog, Bonus, negatively regulates Drosophila Myb activity. The Ski corepressor competes with the coactivator CBP for binding to c-Myb, indicating that the selection of coactivators and corepressors is a key event for c-Myb-dependent transcription. Mutations or deletion of the NRD of c-Myb and the mutations found in the DNA-binding domain of v-Myb decrease the interaction with these corepressors and weaken the corepressor-induced negative regulation of Myb activity.

Removal of various subsets of the 12 exon 4s does not affect MB neuronal morphogenesis, while expression of a Dscam transgene only partially rescues Dscam mutant phenotypes. Interestingly, differential rescuing effects are observed between two Dscam transgenes that each possesses one of the two possible exon 17s. Axon bifurcation/segregation abnormalities are better rescued by the exon 17.2-containing transgene, but coexpression of both transgenes is required for rescuing mutant viability. Meanwhile, exon 17.1 targets ectopically expressed Dscam-GFP to dendrites while Dscam[exon 17.2]-GFP is enriched in axons; only Dscam[exon 17.2] affects MB axons.

To provide a useful model for studying autophagic PCD, I established an in vitro culture system that enables real-time observation of the autophagic cell destruction of Drosophila salivary glands. The new system revealed that de novo gene expression was still required for the destruction of salivary glands dissected from phanerocephalic pupae. This indicates the usefulness of the system for exploring genes that participate in the last processes of autophagic PCD.",2004,Maroko Myohara
Armadillo/Pangolin regulates PCNA and DREF promoter activities,15358517,10.1016/j.bbaexp.2004.07.003,"Here we show that Armadillo and Pangolin (dTCF), downstream effectors of the Wingless (Wg) signal transduction pathway, activate transcription of the important DNA replication-related genes encoding Drosophila proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and DNA replication-related element-binding factor (DREF). By transient luciferase expression assays and band mobility shift assays, we demonstrated the PCNA gene to be a direct target gene for the Armadillo/Pangolin complex. Using a GAL4-UAS system, stimulation of the PCNA gene by Armadillo/Pangolin was confirmed in adult females. From the published reports of an inhibitory role, we expected that Drosophila CREB-binding protein (dCBP) would interfere with activation. However, effects were only observed with the DREF but not the PCNA gene. In the latter case, as in mammals, dCBP could potentiate Armadillo-mediated activation. These results suggest that first, PCNA and DREF genes are targets of the Armadillo/Pangolin complex and second, dCBP modulates Wg signaling in a gene-specific manner.",2004,"Masamitsu Yamaguchi, Mi-Ae Yoo, Eunjeong Kwon, Yuko Hayashi, Yasuyoshi Nishida, Fumiko Hirose, Kyoko Otsuki"
"Characterization of dRFX2, a novel RFX family protein in Drosophila",15494451,10.1093/nar/gkh895,"A transcriptional regulatory element was identified in the region between URE (upstream regulatory element) and DRE (DNA replication-related element) in the Drosophila PCNA gene promoter. This element plays an important role in promoter activity in living flies. A yeast one-hybrid screening using this element as a bait allowed isolation of a cDNA encoding a protein which binds to the element in vitro. Nucleotide sequence analyses revealed that the cDNA encodes a novel protein containing a characteristic DNA-binding domain conserved among the regulatory factor X (RFX) family proteins. We termed this protein Drosophila RFX2 (dRFX2) and this element dRFX2 site. To investigate the function of dRFX2 in vivo, we took the strategy of analyzing the dominant negative effects against the endogenous dRFX2. Transgenic flies were established in which expression of HA-dRFX(202-480) carrying the amino acid sequences from 202 to 480 containing the RFX domain (DNA-binding domain) of dRFX2 was targeted to the cells in the eye imaginal discs. In the eye imaginal disc expressing the HA-dRFX(202-480), the G1-S transition and/or the progression of S phase were/was interrupted, and the ectopic apoptosis was induced, though photoreceptor cells differentiated normally.

"An analysis of 67 RNA-seq datasets from various tissues at different stages of a model insect, Manduca sexta",29041902,10.1186/s12864-017-4147-y,"Background: Manduca sexta is a large lepidopteran insect widely used as a model to study biochemistry of insect physiological processes. As a part of its genome project, over 50 cDNA libraries have been analyzed to profile gene expression in different tissues and life stages. While the RNA-seq data were used to study genes related to cuticle structure, chitin metabolism and immunity, a vast amount of the information has not yet been mined for understanding the basic molecular biology of this model insect. In fact, the basic features of these data, such as composition of the RNA-seq reads and lists of library-correlated genes, are unclear. From an extended view of all insects, clear-cut tempospatial expression data are rarely seen in the largest group of animals including Drosophila and mosquitoes, mainly due to their small sizes. Results: We obtained the transcriptome data, analyzed the raw reads in relation to the assembled genome, and generated heatmaps for clustered genes. Library characteristics (tissues, stages), number of mapped bases, and sequencing methods affected the observed percentages of genome transcription. While up to 40% of the reads were not mapped to the genome in the initial Cufflinks gene modeling, we identified the causes for the mapping failure and reduced the number of non-mappable reads to <8%. Similarities between libraries, measured based on library-correlated genes, clearly identified differences among tissues or life stages. We calculated gene expression levels, analyzed the most abundantly expressed genes in the libraries. Furthermore, we analyzed tissue-specific gene expression and identified 18 groups of genes with distinct expression patterns. Conclusion: We performed a thorough analysis of the 67 RNA-seq datasets to characterize new genomic features of M. sexta. Integrated knowledge of gene functions and expression features will facilitate future functional studies in this biochemical model insect.",2017,"Haobo Jiang, Xiaolong Cao"
The secreted neurotrophin Spätzle 3 promotes glial morphogenesis and supports neuronal survival and function,29138279,10.1101/gad.305888.117,"Most glial functions depend on establishing intimate morphological relationships with neurons. Significant progress has been made in understanding neuron-glia signaling at synaptic and axonal contacts, but how glia support neuronal cell bodies is unclear. Here we explored the growth and functions of Drosophila cortex glia (which associate almost exclusively with neuronal cell bodies) to understand glia-soma interactions. We show that cortex glia tile with one another and with astrocytes to establish unique central nervous system (CNS) spatial domains that actively restrict glial growth, and selective ablation of cortex glia causes animal lethality. In an RNAi-based screen, we identified αSNAP (soluble NSF [N-ethylmalemeide-sensitive factor] attachment protein α) and several components of vesicle fusion and recycling machinery as essential for the maintenance of cortex glial morphology and continued contact with neurons. Interestingly, loss of the secreted neurotrophin Spätzle 3 (Spz3) phenocopied αSNAP phenotypes, which included loss of glial ensheathment of neuron cell bodies, increased neuronal cell death, and defects in animal behavior. Rescue experiments suggest that Spz3 can exert these effects only over very short distances. This work identifies essential roles for glial ensheathment of neuronal cell bodies in CNS homeostasis as well as Spz3 as a novel signaling factor required for maintenance of cortex glial morphology and neuron-glia contact.",2017,"Jaeda C Coutinho-Budd, Amy E Sheehan, Marc R Freeman"
Drosophila DOCK Family Protein Zizimin Involves in Pigment Cell Differentiation in Pupal Retinae,28701658,10.1247/csf.17014,"The dedicator of cytokinesis (DOCK) family proteins are known as one of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), that contribute to cellular signaling processes by activating small G proteins. Although mammalian Zizimin is known to be a GEF for Cdc42 of Rho family small GTPase, its role in vivo is not well understood. Here we studied in vivo function of Drosophila Zizimin (Ziz). Knockdown of Ziz in eye imaginal discs induced the rough eye phenotype accompanied with fusion of ommatidia, loss of bristles and loss of pigments. Immunostaining analyses revealed that Ziz mainly localizes in the secondary pigment cells (SPCs) and tertiary pigment cells (TPCs) in pupal retinae. Ziz-knockdown induced SPC- and TPC-like cells with aberrant morphology in the pupal retina. Delta (Dl), a downstream target of EGFR signaling is known to regulate pigment cell differentiation. Loss-of-function mutation of Dl suppressed the rough eye phenotype and the defect in differentiation of SPCs and TPCs in Ziz-knockdown flies. Moreover, Ziz-knockdown increased Dl expression level especially in SPCs and TPCs. In addition, mutations of rhomboid-1 and roughoid that are activators of EGFR signaling pathway also suppressed both the rough eye phenotype and the defect in differentiation of SPCs and TPCs in Ziz-knockdown flies. Activation of EGFR signaling in Ziz-knockdown flies were further confirmed by immunostaining with anti-diphospho ERK IgG. These results indicate that Ziz negatively regulates the Dl expression in SPCs and TPCs to control differentiation of pigment cells and this regulation is mediated by EGFR signaling pathway.Key words: Zizimin, DOCK, EGFR signaling pathway, pigment cell, Drosophila.",2017,"Masamitsu Yamaguchi, Hideki Yoshida, Fumito Ozasa, Seiji Miyata, Ngoc Anh Suong Dang, Kazushige Morishita"
Drosophila protein phosphatases 2A B' Wdb and Wrd regulate meiotic centromere localization and function of the MEI-S332 Shugoshin,29158400,10.1073/pnas.1718450114,"Proper segregation of chromosomes in meiosis is essential to prevent miscarriages and birth defects. This requires that sister chromatids maintain cohesion at the centromere as cohesion is released on the chromatid arms when the homologs segregate at anaphase I. The Shugoshin proteins preserve centromere cohesion by protecting the cohesin complex from cleavage, and this has been shown in yeasts to be mediated by recruitment of the protein phosphatase 2A B' (PP2A B'). In metazoans, delineation of the role of PP2A B' in meiosis has been hindered by its myriad of other essential roles. The Drosophila Shugoshin MEI-S332 can bind directly to both of the B' regulatory subunits of PP2A, Wdb and Wrd, in yeast two-hybrid experiments. Exploiting experimental advantages of Drosophila spermatogenesis, we found that the Wdb subunit localizes first along chromosomes in meiosis I, becoming restricted to the centromere region as MEI-S332 binds. Wdb and MEI-S332 show colocalization at the centromere region until release of sister-chromatid cohesion at the metaphase II/anaphase II transition. MEI-S332 is necessary for Wdb localization, but, additionally, both Wdb and Wrd are required for MEI-S332 localization. Thus, rather than MEI-S332 being hierarchical to PP2A B', these proteins reciprocally ensure centromere localization of the complex. We analyzed functional relationships between MEI-S332 and the two forms of PP2A by quantifying meiotic chromosome segregation defects in double or triple mutants. These studies revealed that both Wdb and Wrd contribute to MEI-S332's ability to ensure accurate segregation of sister chromatids, but, as in centromere localization, they do not act solely downstream of MEI-S332.",2017,"Belinda S Pinto, Terry L Orr-Weaver"
Rhizoma Coptidis and Berberine as a Natural Drug to Combat Aging and Aging-Related Diseases via Anti-Oxidation and AMPK Activation,29344415,10.14336/AD.2016.0620,"Aging is the greatest risk factor for human diseases, as it results in cellular growth arrest, impaired tissue function and metabolism, ultimately impacting life span. Two different mechanisms are thought to be primary causes of aging. One is cumulative DNA damage induced by a perpetuating cycle of oxidative stress; the other is nutrient-sensing adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and rapamycin (mTOR)/ ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6) pathways. As the main bioactive component of natural Chinese medicine rhizoma coptidis (RC), berberine has recently been reported to expand life span in Drosophila melanogaster, and attenuate premature cellular senescence. Most components of RC including berberine, coptisine, palmatine, and jatrorrhizine have been found to have beneficial effects on hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia and hypertension aging-related diseases. The mechanism of these effects involves multiple cellular kinase and signaling pathways, including anti-oxidation, activation of AMPK signaling and its downstream targets, including mTOR/rpS6, Sirtuin1/ forkhead box transcription factor O3 (FOXO3), nuclear factor erythroid-2 related factor-2 (Nrf2), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathways. Most of these mechanisms converge on AMPK regulation on mitochondrial oxidative stress. Therefore, such evidence supports the possibility that rhizoma coptidis, in particular berberine, is a promising anti-aging natural product, and has pharmaceutical potential in combating aging-related diseases via anti-oxidation and AMPK cellular kinase activation.",2017,"Yi Guo, Shenjun Wang, Qian Shen, Zhigang Chen, Seiji Shioda, Wei Feng, Zhifang Xu, Kun Yu, Nannan Yu"
Inhibition of polyglutamine aggregation by SIMILAR huntingtin N-terminal sequences: Prospective molecules for preclinical evaluation in Huntington's disease,28406522,10.1002/bip.23021,"The mutant huntingtin protein (mHtt) fragments with expanded polyglutamine sequence forms microscopically visible aggregates in neurons, a hallmark of Huntington's disease (HD). The aggregation process and aggregates are possible targets of therapeutic intervention in HD. Owing to the lack of treatment and cure, the patients die within 15-20 years after the disease onset. Therefore, discovering therapeutic molecules that may either inhibit the aggregation mechanism or downregulate the toxic effects of mHtt are highly needed. This study demonstrates the design and use of peptide inhibitors based on the role played by the N-terminal seventeen amino acid sequence (NT17 ) of huntingtin fragment in its aggregation. Fug-NT17 (Fugu), Xen-NT17 (Xenopus), Dro-NT17 (Drosophila), Aib-NT17 , and Pro-NT17 sequences were tested for their ability to inhibit aggregation. Among them, the first three are the sequence variants of human NT17 from evolutionarily distant organisms and the latter two are the analogs of human NT17 -containing aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) and proline (Pro). Four out of five inhibited the aggregation of huntingtin fragment, NT17 Q35 P10 K2 polypeptide.

Opposite effects of 5-HT/AKH and octopamine on the crop contractions in adult Drosophila melanogaster: Evidence of a double brain-gut serotonergic circuitry,28334024,10.1371/journal.pone.0174172,"This study showed that in adult Drosophila melanogaster, the type of sugar-either present within the crop lumen or in the bathing solution of the crop-had no effect on crop muscle contraction. What is important, however, is the volume within the crop lumen. Electrophysiological recordings demonstrated that exogenous applications of serotonin on crop muscles increases both the amplitude and the frequency of crop contraction rate, while adipokinetic hormone mainly enhances the crop contraction frequency. Conversely, octopamine virtually silenced the overall crop activity. The present study reports for the first time an analysis of serotonin effects along the gut-brain axis in adult D. melanogaster. Injection of serotonin into the brain between the interocellar area shows that brain applications of serotonin decrease the frequency of crop activity. Based on our results, we propose that there are two different, opposite pathways for crop motility control governed by serotonin: excitatory when added in the abdomen (i.e., directly bathing the crop) and inhibitory when supplied within the brain (i.e., by injection). Finally, our results point to a double brain-gut serotonergic circuitry suggesting that not only the brain can affect gut functions, but the gut can also affect the central nervous system. On the basis of our results, and data in the literature, a possible mechanism for these two discrete serotonergic functions is suggested.",2017,"Lorenzo Picciau, Anna Liscia, Ludovico Murru, Nicholas Rivelli, John G Stoffolano Jr, Francescaelena De Rose, Paolo Solari"
[Identification and characterization of epidermal growth factor receptor ligands in Bombyx mori],28956382,10.13345/j.cjb.160271,"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a multi-functional receptor distributed throughout the metazoa. Study on its ligands so far remained mainly on mammals, including how ligands are processed into active forms, their interaction with EGFR, and the signaling pathway they induce. However, in invertebrates, ligands are more divergent among species. Currently, except for Drosophila, less is known about the insect EGFR ligands. Here, we identified two EGFR ligands in Bombyx mori by homology search, domain prediction, analysis of the potential translation initiation sequence and construction of phylogenetic tree, termed as BmEGF-1 and BmEGF-2. BmEGF-1 shows the greatest similarity to Drosophila Spitz and their Rhomboid-recognition motifs are highly identical. BmEGF-2 is a homolog to Drosophila Vein. Then we purified BmEGF-1 extracellular domain expressed in E. coli, and performed pull-down assay with BmEGFR extracellular domain secreted by Sf9 cells. The result confirmed their interaction. Lastly, we found the phosphorylation level of ERK and p38 MAPK was elevated after expression of BmEGF-1 in BmE cells, which suggested that BmEGF-1 is not only able to activate the canonical ERK signaling pathway, but may participate in other cellular processes by inducing p38 MAPK signaling pathway.

Coupling of Polo kinase activation to nuclear localization by a bifunctional NLS is required during mitotic entry,29167465,10.1038/s41467-017-01876-8,"The Polo kinase is a master regulator of mitosis and cytokinesis conserved from yeasts to humans. Polo is composed of an N-term kinase domain (KD) and a C-term polo-box domain (PBD), which regulates its subcellular localizations. The PBD and KD can interact and inhibit each other, and this reciprocal inhibition is relieved when Polo is phosphorylated at its activation loop. How Polo activation and localization are coupled during mitotic entry is unknown. Here we report that PBD binding to the KD masks a nuclear localization signal (NLS). Activating phosphorylation of the KD leads to exposure of the NLS and entry of Polo into the nucleus before nuclear envelope breakdown. Failures of this mechanism result in misregulation of the Cdk1-activating Cdc25 phosphatase and lead to mitotic and developmental defects in Drosophila. These results uncover spatiotemporal mechanisms linking master regulatory enzymes during mitotic entry.",2017,"Hugo Lavoie, Karine Normandin, David Kachaner, Haytham Mehsen, Vincent Archambault, Damien Garrido"
Diversity and functions of protein glycosylation in insects,28232040,10.1016/j.ibmb.2017.02.005,"The majority of proteins is modified with carbohydrate structures. This modification, called glycosylation, was shown to be crucial for protein folding, stability and subcellular location, as well as protein-protein interactions, recognition and signaling. Protein glycosylation is involved in multiple physiological processes, including embryonic development, growth, circadian rhythms, cell attachment as well as maintenance of organ structure, immunity and fertility. Although the general principles of glycosylation are similar among eukaryotic organisms, insects synthesize a distinct repertoire of glycan structures compared to plants and vertebrates. Consequently, a number of unique insect glycans mediate functions specific to this class of invertebrates. For instance, the core α1,3-fucosylation of N-glycans is absent in vertebrates, while in insects this modification is crucial for the development of wings and the nervous system. At present, most of the data on insect glycobiology comes from research in Drosophila. Yet, progressively more information on the glycan structures and the importance of glycosylation in other insects like beetles, caterpillars, aphids and bees is becoming available.

Tissue-wide Mechanical Forces Influence the Polarity of Stomatal Stem Cells in Arabidopsis,28285992,10.1016/j.cub.2017.01.059,"Mechanical information is an important contributor to cell polarity in uni- and multicellular systems [1-3]. In planar tissues like the Drosophila wing, cell polarity reorients during growth as cells divide and reorganize [4]. In another planar tissue, the Arabidopsis leaf epidermis [5], polarized, asymmetric divisions of stomatal stem cells (meristemoid mother cells [MMCs]) are fundamental for the generation and patterning of multiple cell types, including stomata. The activity of key transcription factors, polarizing factors [6], and peptide signals [7] explains some local stomatal patterns emerging from the behavior of a few lineally related cells [6, 8-11]. Here we demonstrate that, in addition to locally acting signals, tissue-wide mechanical forces can act as organizing cues, and that they do so by influencing the polarity of individual MMCs. If the mechanical stress environment in the tissue is altered through stretching or cell ablations, cellular polarity changes in response. In turn, polarity predicts the orientation of cellular and tissue outgrowth, leading to increased mechanical conflicts between neighboring cells. This interplay among growth, oriented divisions, and cell specification could contribute to the characteristic patterning of stomatal guard cells in the context of a growing leaf.",2017,"Dominique C Bergmann, Martin Bringmann"

Here I explore the evolution of Wolbachia, and the relationship between Wolbachia and mtDNA, using a large inbred panel of Drosophila simulans. I compare this to the only other large population genomic Wolbachia dataset from D. melanogaster. I find reduced diversity relative to expectation in both Wolbachia and mtDNA, but only mtDNA shows evidence of a recent selective sweep or population bottleneck. I estimate Wolbachia and mtDNA titre in each genotype, and I find considerable variation in both phenotypes, despite low genetic diversity in Wolbachia and mtDNA. A phylogeny of Wolbachia and of mtDNA suggest a recent origin of the infection derived from a single origin. Using Wolbachia and mtDNA titre as a phenotype, I perform the first association analysis using this phenotype with the nuclear genome and find several implicated regions, including one which contains four CAAX-box protein processing genes.

Modelling PD in rodents has been a persistent challenge for the field. However, the fruit fly has been exploited to recapitulate PD gene related dopaminergic cell loss. Using the GAL4-UAS system and established models of hLRRK2 induced eye degeneration in Drosophila, we conducted an unbiased suppressor/enhancer screen to uncover genetic modifiers of LRRK2.

The Cyp6g1 gene of the vinegar fly, Drosophila melanogaster, is a paradigm for the study of metabolic resistance. Constitutive overexpression of this gene confers resistance to several classes of insecticides, including the neonicotinoid imidacloprid (IMI). The metabolism of IMI in this species has been previously shown to yield oxidative and nitro-reduced metabolites. While levels of the oxidative metabolites are correlated with CYP6G1 expression, nitro-reduced metabolites are not, raising the question of how these metabolites are produced. Some IMI metabolites are known to be toxic, making their fate within the insect a second question of interest. These questions have been addressed by coupling the genetic tools of gene overexpression and CRISPR gene knock-out with the mass spectrometric technique, the Twin-Ion Method (TIM). Analysing axenic larvae indicated that microbes living within D. melanogaster are largely responsible for the production of the nitro-reduced metabolites. Knock-out of Cyp6g1 revealed functional redundancy, with some metabolites produced by CYP6G1 still detected.

Interestingly, Nde1, the mitochondrial external NADH dehydrogenase, and Pda1, the core enzyme of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, are required for spartin-mediated cytoprotection. Furthermore, spartin interacts with the glycolysis enhancer phospo-fructo-kinase-2,6 (Pfk26) and is sufficient to complement for PFK26-deficiency at least in early aging.

Drosophila Sulf1 is required for the termination of intestinal stem cell division during regeneration,27888216,10.1242/jcs.195305,"Stem cell division is activated to trigger regeneration in response to tissue damage.

Here, we show that a specific modification of heparan sulfate is crucial for regulating Drosophila intestinal stem cell (ISC) division during normal midgut homeostasis and regeneration. Loss of the extracellular heparan sulfate endosulfatase Sulf1 resulted in increased ISC division during normal homeostasis, which was caused by upregulation of mitogenic signaling including the JAK-STAT, EGFR and Hedgehog pathways. Using a regeneration model, we found that ISCs failed to properly halt division at the termination stage in Sulf1 mutants, showing that Sulf1 is required for terminating ISC division at the end of regeneration. We propose that post-transcriptional regulation of mitogen signaling by heparan sulfate structural modifications provides a new regulatory step for precise temporal control of stem cell activity during regeneration.",2017,"Hiroshi Nakato, Masahiko Takemura"

These different forms of regulation are mediated by the various protein subunits of the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes that assemble on maternal mRNAs. However, while many of the subunits that regulate the localization and translation of maternal transcripts have been identified, relatively little is known about how maternal mRNAs are stockpiled and stored in a stable form to support early development. One of the best characterized regulators of maternal transcripts is Cup - a broadly conserved component of the maternal RNP complex that in Drosophila acts as a translational repressor of the localized message oskar. In this study, we have found that loss of cup disrupts the localization of both the oskar mRNA and its associated proteins to the posterior pole of the developing oocyte. This defect is not due to a failure to specify the oocyte or to disruption of RNP transport. Rather, the localization defects are due to a drop in oskar mRNA levels in cup mutant egg chambers. Thus, in addition to its role in regulating oskar mRNA translation, Cup also plays a critical role in controlling the stability of the oskar transcript. This suggests that Cup is ideally positioned to coordinate the translational control function of the maternal RNP complex with its role in storing maternal transcripts in a stable form.",2017,"Risa M Broyer, Elena Monfort, James E Wilhelm"
Constitutive function of the basic helix-loop-helix/PAS factor Arnt.

In the absence of dioxin, Arnt does not bind to this target sequence motif. The constitutive function of Arnt is presently not understood. Here we demonstrate that Arnt constitutively bound the E box motif CACGTG that is also recognized by a number of distinct bHLH factors, including USF and Max. Importantly, amino acids that have been identified to be critical for E box recognition by Max and USF are conserved in Arnt. Consistent with these observations, full-length Arnt, but not an Arnt deletion mutant lacking its potent C-terminal transactivation domain, constitutively activated CACGTG E box-driven reporter genes in vivo.

Polyubiquitin expression, as well as the levels of ubiquitin conjugates, a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme involved in the ATP/ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic pathway (crustacean E2(16 kDa) homolog of Drosophila UbcD1), and proteasome, were examined to determine the role of ATP/ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis in the enhanced degradation of myofibrillar proteins during muscle atrophy. A partial-length clone (1.7 kb) of polyubiquitin was isolated from a lobster muscle cDNA library; the 5' end lacked the 5' untranslated region (UTR) and the beginning of the first ubiquitin monomer, while the 3' end contained the terminal ubiquitin monomer and 3' UTR. The deduced amino acid sequence was 100% identical with that from Manduca, Drosophila, and human. In land crab claw muscle, the polyubiquitin mRNA (2.7 kb) increased about 5-fold and ubiquitin-protein conjugates (> 200 kDa) increased about 8-fold during atrophy. In contrast, the level of a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2(16 kDa)) remained unchanged. The proteasome, which constitutes the catalytic core of the ATP/ubiquitin-dependent proteinase complex, increased about 2-fold during proecdysis, reaching its highest level immediately before ecdysis. These results suggest that the ATP/ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic pathway contributes to the changes in protein metabolism that occur during molt-induced muscle atrophy.",1995,"B S Shean, D L Mykles"
"Characterization of beta pat-3 heterodimers, a family of essential integrin receptors in C. elegans",7744961,10.1083/jcb.129.4.1127,"Members of the integrin family of cell surface receptors have been shown to mediate a diverse range of cellular functions that require cell-cell or cell-extracellular matrix interactions. We have initiated the characterization of integrin receptors from the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, an organism in which genetics can be used to study integrin function with single cell resolution. Here we report the cloning of an integrin beta subunit from C. elegans which is shown to rescue the embryonic lethal mutation pat-3(rh54) and is thus named beta pat-3. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence revealed that beta pat-3 is more similar to Drosophila integrin beta PS and to vertebrate integrin beta 1 than to other integrin beta subunits. Regions of highest homology are in the RGD-binding region and in the cytoplasmic domain. In addition, the 56 cysteines present in the majority of integrin beta subunits are conserved. A major transcript of approximately 3 kilo-base pairs was detected by RNA blot analysis. Immunoblot analysis using a polyclonal antiserum against the cytoplasmic domain showed that beta pat-3 migrates in SDS-PAGE with apparent M(r) of 109 k and 120 k under nonreducing and reducing conditions, respectively. At least nine protein bands with relative molecular weights in the range observed for known integrin alpha subunits coprecipitate with beta pat-3, and at least three of these bands migrate in SDS-PAGE with increased mobility when reduced. This behavior has been observed for a majority of integrin alpha subunits. Immunoprecipitations of beta pat-3 from developmentally staged populations of C. elegans showed that the expression of several of these bands changes during development.

An inverse PCR screen for the detection of P element insertions in cloned genomic intervals in Drosophila melanogaster,7713430,,"We developed a screening approach that utilizes an inverse polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect P element insertions in or near previously cloned genes in Drosophila melanogaster. We used this approach in a large scale genetic screen in which P elements were mobilized from sites on the X chromosome to new autosomal locations. Mutagenized flies were combined in pools, and our screening approach was used to generate probes corresponding to the sequences flanking each site of insertion. These probes then were used for hybridization to cloned genomic intervals, allowing individuals carrying insertions in them to be detected. We used the same approach to perform repeated rounds of sib-selection to generate stable insertion lines. We screened 16,100 insert bearing individuals and recovered 11 insertions in five intervals containing genes encoding members of the kinesin superfamily in Drosophila melanogaster. In addition, we recovered an insertion in the region including the Larval Serum Protein-2 gene. Examination by Southern hybridization confirms that the lines we recovered represent genuine insertions in the corresponding genomic intervals. Our data indicates that this approach will be very efficient both for P element mutagenesis of new genomic regions and for detection and recovery of ""local"" P element transposition events. In addition, our data constitutes a survey of preferred P element insertion sites in the Drosophila genome and suggests that insertion sites that are mutable at a rate of approximately 10(-4) are distributed every 40-50 kb.",1995,"A J Pereira, B Dalby, L S Goldstein"

Among such clones, the MA-3 mRNA was induced in all apoptosis-inducible cell lines tested so far, including thymocytes, T cells, B cells and pheochromocytoma. The nucleotide sequence of the MA-3 cDNA predicted an amino acid (aa) sequence of 469 aa, which did not reveal significant similarity to any known proteins and functional aa motifs in databases. The MA-3 mRNA was strongly expressed in the thymus although small amounts of the MA-3 mRNA were ubiquitously expressed in mouse adult tissues.

F actin bundles in Drosophila bristles. I. Two filament cross-links are involved in bundling,7622563,10.1083/jcb.130.3.629,"Transverse sections though Drosophila bristles reveal 7-11 nearly round, plasma membrane-associated bundles of actin filaments. These filaments are hexagonally packed and in a longitudinal section they show a 12-nm periodicity in both the 1.1 and 1.0 views. From earlier studies this periodicity is attributable to cross-links and indicates that the filaments are maximally cross-linked, singed mutants also have 7-11 bundles, but the bundles are smaller, flattened, and the filaments within the bundles are randomly packed (not hexagonal); no periodicity can be detected in longitudinal sections. Another mutant, forked (f36a), also has 7-11 bundles but even though the bundles are very small, the filaments within them are hexagonally packed and display a 12-nm periodicity in longitudinal section. The singed-forked double mutant lacks filament bundles. Thus there are at least two species of cross-links between adjacent actin filaments. Hints of why two species of cross-links are necessary can be gleaned by studying bristle formation. Bristles sprout with only microtubules within them. A little later in development actin filaments appear. At early stages the filaments in the bundles are randomly packed. Later the filaments in the bundles become hexagonally packed and maximally cross-linked. We consider that the forked proteins may be necessary early in development to tie the filaments together in a bundle so that they can be subsequently zippered together by fascin (the singed gene product).",1995,"G M Guild, M S Tilney, L G Tilney"
Cell proliferation and DNA replication defects in a Drosophila MCM2 mutant,7622035,10.1101/gad.9.14.1709,"The yeast MCM2, MCM3, and MCM5/CDC46 genes are required for DNA replication and have been proposed to act as factors that license the DNA for one and only one round of replication per cell cycle. We have identified a Drosophila gene, DmMCM2, that is highly homologous to MCM2. A P-element insertion into this gene, which prevents its transcription, inhibits proliferation of cells in the imaginal discs and central nervous system (CNS) and causes an apparent prolongation of S phase in the embryonic and larval CNS. DmMCM2 is expressed in the embryo in a pattern corresponding to that of S-phase cells.

A novel 43 kd protein binds a conserved Mammalian caccc motif within the Drosophila ras2/rop bidirectional promoter,21552951,10.3892/ijo.7.5.1193,"The Drosophila ras2 promoter is an authentic bidirectional promoter governing the expression of both the Dras2 and rop genes by a single mechanism. Characterisation of the Dras2/rop promoter has revealed that a unitary complex (M) interacts with two promoter sub-domains (regions A and B). Two distinct transcription factors (factors A and B),which make up the major complex (M), bind regions A and B, respectively. We have analyzed the putative CACCC element and AP-1-Iike sequence contained within region B (-41 to -20) of the Dras2/rop promoter. It was found that AP-1 is not involved in Dras2 expression as is the case for the human Ha-ras1 gene. The entire CACCC motif (-34 to -21) shares 83% homology with the conserved mammalian element. Detailed mutational analysis has however revealed that the CACCC core sequence (-27 to -23) is vital for Dras2/rop recognition by factor B. The cytosine residues at positions -27, -25, -24 and -23 were observed to play a critical role in factor B recognition. Factor B has been purified as a 43 kD polypeptide as measured by SDS-PAGE and the relative mass was confirmed by photo-chemical crosslinking.

"Somatic reversion of some copia-like induced mutations, at the white locus of Drosophila melanogaster, after treatment with alkylating agents",7698106,10.1002/em.2850250206,"It has been suggested that transposable elements can be associated with different types of genotoxic effects. For this reason it seems appropriate to outline suitable systems to detect changes in the phenotypic expression of the loci containing transposable elements, as well as those agents that induce such changes. The sex-linked white locus offers a suitable experimental system for studying such events because most of the spontaneous mutations at the white locus are the result of insertions of repeated mobile sequences, and it is easy to follow mutational changes of the locus due to the possibility of detecting even slight changes in eye color. Here we report the results obtained in different strains of Drosophila melanogaster with copia-like induced mutations at the white locus, after treatment with three alkylating agents: ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS), methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), and N-nitroso-N-ethylurea (ENU). The three insertional white mutants used in this work were wa4, wbf, and wsp55, with the wa2 mutation used as control because its mutant phenotype is the result of a point mutation instead of the insertion of a DNA fragment. Our data constitute evidence that EMS, MMS, and ENU induce a clear increase in the frequencies of somatic-revertant sectors in the three strains carrying a white allele with an inserted copia-like element. For the wa2 strain, whose mutant phenotype is the result of a point mutation, only ENU at the highest concentration tested is able to induce a significant increase in the somatic reversion frequency. In addition, our results indicate that the use of D. melanogaster strains with transposable elements in the white locus is suitable for detecting genotoxic damage induced by chemicals.",1995,"S Soriano, N Xamena, A Creus, R Marcos"
The cell cycle-dependent localization of the CP190 centrosomal protein is determined by the coordinate action of two separable domains,8522588,10.1083/jcb.131.5.1261,"CP190, a protein of 1,096 amino acids from Drosophila melanogaster, oscillates in a cell cycle-specific manner between the nucleus during interphase, and the centrosome during mitosis. To characterize the regions of CP190 responsible for its dynamic behavior, we injected rhodamine-labeled fusion proteins spanning most of CP190 into early Drosophila embryos, where their localizations were characterized using time-lapse fluorescence confocal microscopy. A single bipartite 19-amino acid nuclear localization signal was detected that causes nuclear localization. Robust centrosomal localization is conferred by a separate region of 124 amino acids; two adjacent, nonoverlapping fusion proteins containing distinct portions of this region show weaker centrosomal localization. Fusion proteins that contain both nuclear and centrosomal localization sequences oscillate between the nucleus and the centrosome in a manner identical to native CP190. Fusion proteins containing only the centrosome localization sequence are found at centrosomes throughout the cell cycle, suggesting that CP190 is actively recruited away from the centrosome by its movement into the nucleus during interphase. Both native and bacterially expressed CP190 cosediment with microtubules in vitro. Tests with fusion proteins show that the domain responsible for microtubule binding overlaps the domain required for centrosomal localization. CP60, a protein identified by its association with CP190, also localizes to centrosomes and to nuclei in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Experiments in which colchicine is used to depolymerize microtubules in the early Drosophila embryo demonstrate that both CP190 and CP60 are able to attain and maintain their centrosomal localization in the absence of microtubules.",1995,"K Oegema, B Alberts, W G Whitfield"
Conserved alternative splicing patterns and splicing signals in the Drosophila sodium channel gene para,8536968,,"We cloned genomic DNA corresponding to the Drosophila virilis homologue of para, a gene encoding a sodium channel alpha-subunit, and obtained many partial cDNA clones from embryos and adults. Para protein has been well conserved, and the optional elements at six different sites of alternative splicing in D. melanogaster are present in D. virilis, in addition to one new optional exon. Among 31 different splice-types observed in D. virilis, the stage-specific pattern of alternative splicing seen in D. melanogaster is also conserved. Comparison of genomic DNA sequence revealed three aspects that vary between alternatively and constitutively used exon sequences. Sixteen short blocks (10-75 bp), the only recognizably conserved intron sequence, were disproportionately associated with alternatively used splice sites. Silent site substitutions were found much less frequently in alternative than constitutive exon elements, and the degree of match to the Drosophila splice site consensus tended to be lower at less frequently selected alternative splice junctions. This study shows that the developmentally regulated variability of para products is highly conserved and therefore likely to be of functional significance and suggests that a variety of different sequence-dependent mechanisms may regulate this pattern of alternative splicing.",1995,"B Ganetzky, J R Thackeray"
"Lethal of scute, a proneural gene, participates in the specification of muscle progenitors during Drosophila embryogenesis",7557389,10.1101/gad.9.19.2373,"The mechanisms that underlie the segregation of muscle founder cells in the Drosophila embryo are undefined. We show that the proneural gene lethal of scute (l'sc) is expressed in clusters of cells in the somatic mesoderm, from which individual muscle progenitors are singled out by progressive restriction of l'sc expression. Coexpression of l'sc and S59 (a putative muscle identity gene) in a subset of muscle progenitors shows that muscle founders are produced by division of muscle progenitors. In neurogenic mutant embryos the restriction of l'sc expression fails and all cells in a cluster coexpress l'sc and S59. Loss-of-function and overexpression phenotypes indicate a role for l'sc in the segregation of muscle progenitors and the formation of the muscle pattern.",1995,"M Bate, F Jiménez, A Carmena"
Molecular evolution of the duplicated Amy locus in the Drosophila melanogaster species subgroup: concerted evolution only in the coding region and an excess of nonsynonymous substitutions in speciation,8536970,,"From the analysis of restriction maps of the Amy region in eight sibling species belonging to the Drosophila melanogaster species subgroup, we herein show that the patterns of duplication of the Amy gene are almost the same in all species. This indicates that duplication occurred before speciation within this species subgroup. From the nucleotide sequence data, we show a strong within-species similarity between the duplicated loci in the Amy coding region. This is in contrast to a strong similarity in the 5' and 3' flanking regions within each locus (proximal or distal) throughout the species subgroup. This means that concerted evolution occurred only in the Amy coding region and that differentiated evolution between the duplication occurred in the flanking regions. Moreover, when comparing the species, we also found a significant excess of nonsynonymous substitutions. In particular, all the fixed substitutions specific to D. erecta were found to be nonsynonymous. We thus conclude that adaptive protein evolution occurred in the lineage of D. erecta that is a ""specialist"" species for host plants and probably also occurs in the process of speciation in general.",1995,"T Yamazaki, H Shibata"

The pancreatic islet factor STF-1 binds cooperatively with Pbx to a regulatory element in the somatostatin promoter: importance of the FPWMK motif and of the homeodomain,8524276,10.1128/mcb.15.12.7091,"A number of homeodomain proteins have been shown to regulate cellular development by stimulating the transcription of specific target genes. In contrast to their distinct activities in vivo, however, most homeodomain proteins bind indiscriminately to potential target sites in vitro, suggesting the involvement of cofactors which specify target site selection. One such cofactor, termed extradenticle, has been shown to influence segmental morphogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster by binding cooperatively with certain homeodomain proteins to target regulatory elements. Here we demonstrate that STF-1, an orphan homeodomain protein required for pancreatic development in mammals, binds cooperatively to DNA with Pbx, the mammalian homolog of extradenticle. Cooperative binding with Pbx requires a pentapeptide motif (FPWMK) which is well conserved among a large subset of homeodomain proteins. The FPMWK motif is not sufficient to confer Pbx cooperativity on other homeodomain proteins, however; the N-terminal arm of the STF-1 homeodomain is also essential. As cooperative binding with Pbx occurs on only a subset of potential STF-1 target sites, our results suggest that Pbx may specify target gene selection in the developing pancreas by forming heterodimeric complexes with STF-1.",1995,"M Kamps, S Sharma, M Montminy, B Peers, T Johnson"

In this study, we have examined the gene activity of these chromosomes. General gene expression from these chromosomes was studied by uridine autoradiography. The expression of specific genes was monitored by in situ hybridisation to mRNA and also by combining enhancer trap lines with otu mutants. We found that most of the genes studied were expressed in the PNCs as they were in the wild-type nurse cells. Four out of the 12 mRNAs studied accumulated in the nuclei instead of migrating to the cytoplasm. The intensity of accumulation directly correlated with the extent of polytenisation in the PNC nuclei.

"A genetically tagged, defective I element can be complemented by actively transposing I factors in the germline of I-R dysgenic females in Drosophila melanogaster",7565607,10.1007/BF02191643,"Non-LTR retrotransposons, also known as LINEs, transpose by reverse transcription of an RNA intermediate. Their mechanism of transposition is apparently different from that of retrotransposons and similar to that of proviruses of retroviruses. The I factor is responsible for the I-R system of hybrid dysgenesis in Drosophila melanogaster. Inducer strains contain several functional I factors whereas reactive strains do not. Transposition of I factors can be experimentally induced: they are stable in inducer strains, but transpose at high frequency in the germline of females, known as SF females, produced by crossing reactive females and inducer males. We have constructed an I element, called IviP2, marked with the vermilion gene, the coding sequence of which was interrupted by an intron. Splicing of the intron can only occur in the transcript initiated from the I element promoter. Transposed copies expressing a wild-type vermilion phenotype were recovered in the germline of SF females in which I factors were actively transposing. This indicates that trans-complementation of a defective I element, deficient for the second open reading frame, by functional I factors can occur in the germline of dysgenic females.",1995,"I Busseau, A Bucheton, C Bornecque, M C Chaboissier"
extradenticle determines segmental identities throughout Drosophila development,8582279,,"extradenticle (exd) and the homeotic selector proteins together establish segmental identities by coordinately regulating the expression of downstream target genes. The inappropriate expression of these targets in exd mutant embryos results in homeotic transformations and aberrant morphogenesis. Here we examine the role of exd in adult development by using genetic mosaics and a hypomorphic exd allele caused by a point mutation in the homeodomain. exd continues to be essential for the specification of segmental identities, consistent with a continuing requirement for exd as cofactor of the homeotic selector proteins. Loss of exd results in the homeotic transformation of abdominal segments to an A5 or A6 segmental identity, the antenna and arista to leg, and the head capsule to dorsal thorax or notum. Proximal leg structures are particularly sensitive to the loss of exd, although exd does not affect the allocation of proximal positional values of the leg imaginal disc. Using heat-shocks to induce expression of a hsp70-exd fusion gene, we show that, in contrast to the homeotic selector genes, ubiquitously high levels of exd expression do not cause pattern abnormalities or segmental transformations.",1995,"M Peifer, E Wieschaus, C Rauskolb, K M Smith"

In this paper, data on the MR-active chromosomes in natural populations of D. melanogaster from Russia and neighboring countries from 1977 to 1992 are presented.

The V3 loop is also the major determinant for HIV-1 cell-specific tropism. To further characterize the humoral immune response directed against the gp120 envelope proteins, we expressed two prototypic gp120 envelope proteins (LAI/HXB2 and ADA) and chimeric gp120 envelope proteins in stable transfected Drosophila melanogaster Schneider 2 cells.

Sera obtained at early stages preferentially recognized the gp120 envelope protein ADA, whereas in later stages of infection the sera showed diminished reactivity with both gp120 LAI/HXB2 and gp120 ADA. Chimeric envelope proteins revealed that the humoral response was directed primarily against the V3 loop of gp120 ADA. Furthermore, 22 sera from HIV-1 infected individuals in different stages of the disease were tested. Reactivity of sera with the gp120 envelope protein ADA was seven-fold higher than with the gp120 envelope protein LAI/HXB2.

This paper reports the isolation of cnx1, a cDNA clone of Arabidopsis thaliana which complements the Escherichia coli Moco mutant mogA. The mapping data of this cDNA correlate well with the mapping position of the A. thaliana molybdenum co-factor locus chl6. As mutants in chl6 are known to be repairable by high concentrations of molybdate, the defective gene is very likely to be involved in the last step of Moco biosynthesis, that is, the insertion of molybdenum into molybdopterin. The protein encoded by cnx1 shows a two-domain structure: the N-terminal domain is homologous to the E. coli Moco protein MoeA, the C-terminal domain is homologous to the E. coli Moco proteins MoaB and MogA, respectively. These homologies show that part of the prokaryotic Moco biosynthetic pathway accomplished by monofunctional proteins in E. coli, is performed by a single multifunctional protein in eukaryotes. In addition Cnx1 is homologous to the eukaryotic proteins Gephyrin, a rat neuroprotein, and Cinnamon, a Drosophila protein with a function in Moco biosynthesis.

"Biological basis of germline mutation: comparisons of spontaneous germline mutation rates among drosophila, mouse, and human",7789362,10.1002/em.2850250609,"Spontaneous mutation rates per generation are similar among the three species considered here--Drosophila, mouse, and human--and are not related to time, as is often assumed. Spontaneous germline mutation rates per generation averaged among loci are less variable among species than they are among loci and tests and between gender. Mutation rates are highly variable over time in diverse lineages. Recent estimates of the number of germ cell divisions per generation are: for humans, 401 (30-year generation) in males and 31 in females; for mice, 62 (9-month generation) in males and 25 in females; and for Drosophila melanogaster, 35.5 (18-day generation) in males and 36.5 (25-day generation) in females. The relationships between germ cell division estimates of the two sexes in the three species closely reflect those between mutation rates in the sexes, although mutation rates per cell division vary among species. Whereas the overall rate per generation is constant among species, this consistency must be achieved by diverse mechanisms. Modifiers of mutation rates, on which selection might act, include germline characteristics that contribute disproportionately to the total mutation rates. The germline mutation rates between the sexes within a species are largely influenced by germ cell divisions per generation. Also, a large portion of the total mutations occur during the interval between the beginning of meiosis and differentiation of the soma from the germline.

MAGUKs are localized at the membrane-cytoskeleton interface, usually at cell-cell junctions, where they appear to have both structural and signaling roles. They contain several distinct domains, including a modified guanylate kinase domain, an SH3 motif, and one or three copies of the DHR (GLGF/PDZ) domain. Recessive lethal mutations in the discs large tumor suppressor gene interfere with the formation of septate junctions (thought to be the arthropod equivalent of tight junctions) between epithelial cells, and they cause neoplastic overgrowth of imaginal discs, suggesting a role for cell junctions in proliferation control. A homologue of the Dlg protein, named Hdlg, has been isolated from human B lymphocytes. It shows 65-79% identity to Dlg in the different domains, and it binds to the cytoskeletal protein 4.1. Here, we report that the gene for lymphocyte Hdlg, named DLG1, is located at chromosome band 3q29. This finding identifies a novel site for a candidate tumor suppressor on chromosome 3.",1995,"D J Peel, J H Knoll, S M Marfatia, A H Chishti, P J Bryant, A C Azim"
Expression of msl-2 causes assembly of dosage compensation regulators on the X chromosomes and female lethality in Drosophila,7781064,10.1016/0092-8674(95)90007-1,"Male-specific lethal-2 (msl-2) is a RING finger protein that is required for X chromosome dosage compensation in Drosophila males. Consistent with the formation of a dosage compensation protein complex, msl-2 colocalizes with the other MSL proteins on the male X chromosome and coimmunoprecipitates with msl-1 from male larval extracts. Ectopic expression of msl-2 in females results in the appearance of the other MSL dosage compensation regulators on the female X chromosomes and decreased female viability.

Novel functions for integrin-associated proteins revealed by analysis of myofibril attachment in Drosophila,30028294,10.7554/eLife.35783,"We use the myotendinous junction of Drosophila flight muscles to explore why many integrin associated proteins (IAPs) are needed and how their function is coordinated. These muscles revealed new functions for IAPs not required for viability: Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK), RSU1, tensin and vinculin. Genetic interactions demonstrated a balance between positive and negative activities, with vinculin and tensin positively regulating adhesion, while FAK inhibits elevation of integrin activity by tensin, and RSU1 keeps PINCH activity in check. The molecular composition of myofibril termini resolves into 4 distinct layers, one of which is built by a mechanotransduction cascade: vinculin facilitates mechanical opening of filamin, which works with the Arp2/3 activator WASH to build an actin-rich layer positioned between integrins and the first sarcomere. Thus, integration of IAP activity is needed to build the complex architecture of the myotendinous junction, linking the membrane anchor to the sarcomere.",2018,"Annabel Gm Griffiths, Hannah J Green, Nicholas H Brown, Jari Ylänne"

Chronic exposure to acephate triggers ROS-mediated injuries at organismal and sub-organismal levels of Drosophila melanogaster,30310664,10.1039/c8tx00052b,"The present study demonstrates ROS-mediated organismal and sub-organismal injuries in Drosophila melanogaster following chronic acephate exposure. Larvae and adults of Drosophila were reared on food supplemented with sub-lethal concentrations (1-6 μg mL-1) of acephate (LC50 8.71 μg mL-1). The longevity of the treated adults was reduced to half at 6 μg mL-1 exposure along with declined neuromuscular coordination and physical activities. Apparent developmental defects in the compound eyes were confirmed through the detection of apoptotic lesions in larval eye imaginal discs. The larval gut manifested tissue damage at various sites. Neural and fat cell viability was reduced by ∼1.89- and ∼3.38-fold at 6 μg mL-1 acephate treatment, respectively. A significant reduction in hemocyte viability confirmed the immunotoxic potential of acephate. Nearly 1-3-fold enhancement in the expression of OS markers (MDA, protein carbonyl contents, SOD, catalase and HSP70) in the treated larvae served as evidence of ROS production. The post-treatment increase in CYP450 and GST activities reflects the 'switch-on' states of the phase-I and phase-II detoxification mechanism. The genotoxic potential of acephate was confirmed through alkaline single cell gel electrophoresis. Thus, the findings of the present study validate the fact that besides traditional cholinesterase inhibition, chronic sub-lethal exposure to acephate potentially induces ROS-mediated toxic responses in Drosophila.",2018,"Salma Khatun, Moutushi Mandi, Sumedha Roy, Moumita Dutta, Prem Rajak"
Role of Glial Immunity in Lifespan Determination: A Drosophila Perspective,29942319,10.3389/fimmu.2018.01362,"Increasing body of evidence indicates that proper glial function plays an important role in neuroprotection and in organismal physiology throughout lifespan. Work done in the model organism Drosophila melanogaster has revealed important aspects of glial cell biology in the contexts of longevity and neurodegeneration. In this mini review, we summarize recent findings from work done in the fruit fly Drosophila about the role of glia in maintaining a healthy status during animal's life and discuss the involvement of glial innate immune pathways in lifespan and neurodegeneration. Overactive nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathways and defective phagocytosis appear to be major contributors to lifespan shortening and neuropathology. Glial NF-κB silencing on the other hand, extends lifespan possibly through an immune-neuroendocrine axis.

Impact of short- and long-term heat stress on reproductive potential of Drosophila suzukii Matsumura (Diptera: Drosophilidae),30509672,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.09.011,"Drosophila suzukii Matsumura (Diptera: Drosophilidae) is an invasive vinegar fly of Asian origin now distributed throughout North America. Due to the unique morphology of females, this fly has become one of the most serious pests of thin-skinned fruits including blueberry, blackberry, cherry, raspberry, and strawberry. Prophylactic insecticide applications are commonly used to control this fly. A more sustainable approach to managing this invasive pest may not be possible without a clear understanding of the biology of this species under extreme environmental conditions. Specifically, high temperature is known to interfere with development and reproduction of drosophilids; however, the impact of high temperature on D. suzukii needs to be further investigated. The objective of the present study was to investigate the impact of exposure to constant and relatively short-term heat stress on reproductive success of D. suzukii, and potential for recovery. Results show that the development and reproduction of D. suzukii were negatively affected by constant and relatively short-term heat stress. Under constant heat stress, oviposition rate and adult lifespan decreased as temperature increased from 24 °C to 33 °C and reproduction was completely absent at 33 °C. Under relatively short-term heat stress, oviposition, pupation, and adult eclosion were significantly decreased as temperature increased from 28 °C to 34 °C. The short-term heat stress greatly reduced the fertility of both male and female D. suzukii which was recovered eight days after treatment. This study provides basic information on thermal biology of D. suzukii to help us better understand the trends commonly observed in D. suzukii trap captures in regions with hot summer conditions, and the results can be used in population models to predict its population dynamics in regions where high temperatures prevail during the field season.",2018,"Richard K Evans, Michael D Toews, Ashfaq A Sial"
Crystal Structure of the Labile Complex of IL-24 with the Extracellular Domains of IL-22R1 and IL-20R2,30111632,10.4049/jimmunol.1800726,"Crystal structure of the ternary complex of human IL-24 with two receptors, IL-22R1 and IL-20R2, has been determined at 2.15 Å resolution. A crystallizable complex was created by a novel approach involving fusing the ligand with a flexible linker to the presumed low-affinity receptor, and coexpression of this construct in Drosophila S2 cells together with the presumed high-affinity receptor. This approach, which may be generally applicable to other multiprotein complexes with low-affinity components, was necessitated by the instability of IL-24 expressed by itself in either bacteria or insect cells. Although IL-24 expressed in Escherichia coli was unstable and precipitated almost immediately upon its refolding and purification, a small fraction of IL-24 remaining in the folded state was shown to be active in a cell-based assay. In the crystal structure presented here, we found that two cysteine residues in IL-24 do not form a predicted disulfide bond. Lack of structural restraint by disulfides, present in other related cytokines, is most likely reason for the low stability of IL-24. Although the contact area between IL-24 and IL-22R1 is larger than between the cytokine and IL-20R2, calculations show the latter interaction to be slightly more stable, suggesting that the shared receptor (IL-20R2) might be the higher-affinity receptor.",2018,"Andriy Anishkin, Alexander Wlodawer, Jacek Lubkowski, Cem Sonmez, Sergei V Kotenko, Sergey V Smirnov"

Here, we show that ER stress-inducing drugs activate the TOR signaling pathway in S2R+ Drosophila cells. Activating transcription factor 6 (Atf6), a major stress-responsive ER transmembrane protein, is responsible for ER stress-induced TOR activation.

Structural insights into the sequence-specific recognition of Piwi by Drosophila Papi,29531043,10.1073/pnas.1717116115,"The Tudor domain-containing (Tdrd) family proteins play a critical role in transposon silencing in animal gonads by recognizing the symmetrically dimethylated arginine (sDMA) on the (G/A)R motif of the N-terminal of PIWI family proteins via the eTud domains.

However, the molecular and structural basis of the Papi-Piwi complex is still not fully understood, which limits mechanistic understanding of the function of Papi in piRNA biogenesis. In the present study, we determined the crystal structures of Papi-eTud in the apo form and in complex with a peptide containing unmethylated or dimethylated R10 residues. Structural and biochemical analysis showed that the Papi interaction region on the Drosophila Piwi contains an RGRRR motif (R7-R11) distinct from the consensus (G/A)R motif recognized by canonical eTud.

We find that activation of Ras/ERK signalling promotes tRNA synthesis both in vivo and in cultured Drosophila S2 cells. We also show that Pol III function is required for Ras/ERK signalling to drive proliferation in both epithelial and stem cells in Drosophila tissues. We find that the transcription factor Myc is required but not sufficient for Ras-mediated stimulation of tRNA synthesis. Instead we show that Ras signalling promotes Pol III function and tRNA synthesis by phosphorylating, and inhibiting the nuclear localization and function of the Pol III repressor Maf1.

RepLong: de novo repeat identification using long read sequencing data,29126180,10.1093/bioinformatics/btx717,"Motivation: The identification of repetitive elements is important in genome assembly and phylogenetic analyses. The existing de novo repeat identification methods exploiting the use of short reads are impotent in identifying long repeats. Since long reads are more likely to cover repeat regions completely, using long reads is more favorable for recognizing long repeats. Results: In this study, we propose a novel de novo repeat elements identification method namely RepLong based on PacBio long reads. Given that the reads mapped to the repeat regions are highly overlapped with each other, the identification of repeat elements is equivalent to the discovery of consensus overlaps between reads, which can be further cast into a community detection problem in the network of read overlaps. In RepLong, we first construct a network of read overlaps based on pair-wise alignment of the reads, where each vertex indicates a read and an edge indicates a substantial overlap between the corresponding two reads. Secondly, the communities whose intra connectivity is greater than the inter connectivity are extracted based on network modularity optimization. Finally, representative reads in each community are extracted to form the repeat library. Comparison studies on Drosophila melanogaster and human long read sequencing data with genome-based and short-read-based methods demonstrate the efficiency of RepLong in identifying long repeats. RepLong can handle lower coverage data and serve as a complementary solution to the existing methods to promote the repeat identification performance on long-read sequencing data.

Structure and development of the subesophageal zone of the Drosophila brain. II. Sensory compartments,28875566,10.1002/cne.24316,"The subesophageal zone (SEZ) of the Drosophila brain processes mechanosensory and gustatory sensory input from sensilla located on the head, mouth cavity and trunk. Motor output from the SEZ directly controls the movements involved in feeding behavior. In an accompanying paper (Hartenstein et al., ), we analyzed the systems of fiber tracts and secondary lineages to establish reliable criteria for defining boundaries between the four neuromeres of the SEZ, as well as discrete longitudinal neuropil domains within each SEZ neuromere. Here we use this anatomical framework to systematically map the sensory projections entering the SEZ throughout development. Our findings show continuity between larval and adult sensory neuropils. Gustatory axons from internal and external taste sensilla of the larva and adult form two closely related sensory projections, (a) the anterior central sensory center located deep in the ventromedial neuropil of the tritocerebrum and mandibular neuromere, and (b) the anterior ventral sensory center (AVSC), occupying a superficial layer within the ventromedial tritocerebrum. Additional, presumed mechanosensory terminal axons entering via the labial nerve define the ventromedial sensory center (VMSC) in the maxilla and labium. Mechanosensory afferents of the massive array of chordotonal organs (Johnston's organ) of the adult antenna project into the centrolateral neuropil column of the anterior SEZ, creating the antenno-mechanosensory and motor center (AMMC). Dendritic projections of dye back-filled motor neurons extend throughout a ventral layer of the SEZ, overlapping widely with the AVSC and VMSC.

Deciphering pleiotropy: How complex genes regulate behavior,30083283,10.1080/19420889.2018.1447743,"The genetic underpinnings of animal behavior are exceedingly complex. Behavioral phenotypes are commonly regulated by many genes, and the behavioral effects of a gene often dependent on environmental conditions and genetic background. To complicate the study of behavioral genetics further, many genes that regulate behavioral phenotypes are themselves very complex genes, with several gene products and functions. One example of such a complex gene is the foraging gene in D. melanogaster. foraging influences many behaviors in the fruit fly, and the key to its effects likely lies in its complex molecular structure.

INVOLVEMENT OF PEPTIDOGLYCAN RECOGNITION PROTEIN L6 IN ACTIVATION OF IMMUNE DEFICIENCY PATHWAY IN THE IMMUNE RESPONSIVE SILKWORM CELLS,26991439,10.1002/arch.21326,"The immune deficiency (Imd) signaling pathway is activated by Gram-negative bacteria for producing antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). In Drosophila melanogaster, the activation of this pathway is initiated by the recognition of Gram-negative bacteria by peptidoglycan (PGN) recognition proteins (PGRPs), PGRP-LC and PGRP-LE. In this study, we found that the Imd pathway is involved in enhancing the promoter activity of AMP gene in response to Gram-negative bacteria or diaminopimelic (DAP) type PGNs derived from Gram-negative bacteria in an immune responsive silkworm cell line, Bm-NIAS-aff3. Using gene knockdown experiments, we further demonstrated that silkworm PGRP L6 (BmPGRP-L6) is involved in the activation of E. coli or E. coli-PGN mediated AMP promoter activation. Domain analysis revealed that BmPGRP-L6 contained a conserved PGRP domain, transmembrane domain, and RIP homotypic interaction motif like motif but lacked signal peptide sequences. BmPGRP-L6 overexpression enhances AMP promoter activity through the Imd pathway. BmPGRP-L6 binds to DAP-type PGNs, although it also binds to lysine-type PGNs that activate another immune signal pathway, the Toll pathway in Drosophila. These results indicate that BmPGRP-L6 is a key PGRP for activating the Imd pathway in immune responsive silkworm cells.",2016,"Hiromitsu Tanaka, Aki Sagisaka"
pGluAβ increases accumulation of Aβ in vivo and exacerbates its toxicity,27717375,10.1186/s40478-016-0380-x,"Several species of β-amyloid peptides (Aβ) exist as a result of differential cleavage from amyloid precursor protein (APP) to yield various C-terminal Aβ peptides. Several N-terminal modified Aβ peptides have also been identified in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains, the most common of which is pyroglutamate-modified Aβ (AβpE3-42). AβpE3-42 peptide has an increased propensity to aggregate, appears to accumulate in the brain before the appearance of clinical symptoms of AD, and precedes Aβ1-42 deposition. Moreover, in vitro studies have shown that AβpE3-42 can act as a seed for full length Aβ1-42. In this study, we characterized the Drosophila model of AβpE3-42 toxicity by expressing the peptide in specific sets of neurons using the GAL4-UAS system, and measuring different phenotypic outcomes. We found that AβpE3-42 peptide had an increased propensity to aggregate. Expression of AβpE3-42 in the neurons of adult flies led to behavioural dysfunction and shortened lifespan. Expression of AβpE3-42 constitutively in the eyes led to disorganised ommatidia, and activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway. The eye disruption was almost completely rescued by co-expressing a candidate Aβ degrading enzyme, neprilysin2. Furthermore, we found that neprilysin2 was capable of degrading AβpE3-42. Also, we tested the seeding hypothesis for AβpE3-42 in vivo, and measured its effect on Aβ1-42 levels. We found that Aβ1-42 levels were significantly increased when Aβ1-42 and AβpE3-42 peptides were co-expressed. Furthermore, we found that AβpE3-42 enhanced Aβ1-42 toxicity in vivo. Our findings implicate AβpE3-42 as an important source of toxicity in AD, and suggest that its specific degradation could be therapeutic.",2016,"Mobina Khericha, Oyinkan Sofola-Adesakin, Inge Snoeren, Linda Partridge, Leo Tsuda"
Olfactory Behaviors Assayed by Computer Tracking Of Drosophila in a Four-quadrant Olfactometer,27585032,10.3791/54346,"A key challenge in neurobiology is to understand how neural circuits function to guide appropriate animal behaviors. Drosophila melanogaster is an excellent model system for such investigations due to its complex behaviors, powerful genetic techniques, and compact nervous system. Laboratory behavioral assays have long been used with Drosophila to simulate properties of the natural environment and study the neural mechanisms underlying the corresponding behaviors (e.g. phototaxis, chemotaxis, sensory learning and memory)(1-3). With the recent availability of large collections of transgenic Drosophila lines that label specific neural subsets, behavioral assays have taken on a prominent role to link neurons with behaviors(4-11). Versatile and reproducible paradigms, together with the underlying computational routines for data analysis, are indispensable for rapid tests of candidate fly lines with various genotypes. Particularly useful are setups that are flexible in the number of animals tested, duration of experiments and nature of presented stimuli. The assay of choice should also generate reproducible data that is easy to acquire and analyze. Here, we present a detailed description of a system and protocol for assaying behavioral responses of Drosophila flies in a large four-field arena. The setup is used here to assay responses of flies to a single olfactory stimulus; however, the same setup may be modified to test multiple olfactory, visual or optogenetic stimuli, or a combination of these.

Extended longevity and survivorship during amino-acid starvation in a Drosophila Sir2 mutant heterozygote,27074822,10.1139/gen-2015-0213,"The regulation of energy homeostasis is pivotal to survive periods of inadequate nutrition. A combination of intricate pathways and proteins are responsible for maximizing longevity during such conditions. The sirtuin deacetylase Sir2 is well conserved from single-celled yeast to mammals, and it controls a number of downstream targets that are active during periods of extreme stress. Overexpression of Sir2 has been established to enhance survival of a number of model organisms undergoing calorie restriction, during which insulin receptor signalling (IRS) is reduced, a condition that itself can enhance survivorship during starvation. Increased Sir2 expression and reduced IRS result in an increase in the activity of the transcription factor foxo, an advantageous activation during stress but lethal when overly active. We have found that a lowered gene dosage of Sir2, in mutant heterozygotes, can extend normal longevity and greatly augment survivorship during amino-acid starvation in Drosophila. Additionally, these mutants, in either heterozygous or homozygous form, do not appear to have any disadvantageous effects upon development or cell growth of the organism unlike IRS mutants. These results may advance the understanding of the biological response to starvation and allow for the development of a model organism to mimic the ability of individuals to tolerate nutrient deprivation.",2016,"Jennifer D Slade, Brian E Staveley"

Rbf mutant alleles exhibit overproliferation of spermatogonial cells, which is phenocopied by the molecularly characterized Rbf11 null allele. We demonstrate that Rbf promotes cell-cycle exit and differentiation of the somatic and germline stem cells of the testes. Intriguingly, depletion of Rbf specifically in the germline does not disrupt stem cell differentiation, rather Rbf loss of function in the somatic lineage drives overproliferation and differentiation defects in both lineages.

Euchromatin histone methyltransferase 1 regulates cortical neuronal network development,27767173,10.1038/srep35756,"Heterozygous mutations or deletions in the human Euchromatin histone methyltransferase 1 (EHMT1) gene cause Kleefstra syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder that is characterized by autistic-like features and severe intellectual disability (ID). Neurodevelopmental disorders including ID and autism may be related to deficits in activity-dependent wiring of brain circuits during development. Although Kleefstra syndrome has been associated with dendritic and synaptic defects in mice and Drosophila, little is known about the role of EHMT1 in the development of cortical neuronal networks. Here we used micro-electrode arrays and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings to investigate the impact of EHMT1 deficiency at the network and single cell level. We show that EHMT1 deficiency impaired neural network activity during the transition from uncorrelated background action potential firing to synchronized network bursting. Spontaneous bursting and excitatory synaptic currents were transiently reduced, whereas miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents were not affected. Finally, we show that loss of function of EHMT1 ultimately resulted in less regular network bursting patterns later in development. These data suggest that the developmental impairments observed in EHMT1-deficient networks may result in a temporal misalignment between activity-dependent developmental processes thereby contributing to the pathophysiology of Kleefstra syndrome.",2016,"Elske Bijvank, Dirk Schubert, Lisa Epping, Jessica Classen, Marco Benevento, Marijn Bart Martens, Nael Nadif Kasri, Hans van Bokhoven, Paul Tiesinga, Monica Frega"

The F(1) progeny of the reciprocal crosses between HF-R and Roth showed 640-fold (R♀ × S♂) and 1,380-fold (R♂ × S♀) resistance to fipronil, indicating resistance is inherited as an incompletely dominant trait.

The LC(50) of the R♂ × S♀ cross F(1) progeny is slightly but significantly higher than that of the R♀ × S♂ cross F(1) progeny, suggesting a minor resistance gene on the Z chromosome. Sequence analysis of PxGABARα1 (an Rdl-homologous GABA receptor gene of P. xylostella) from the HF-R strain identified two mutations A282S and A282G (corresponding to the A302S mutation of the Drosophila melanogaster Rdl gene), which have been previously implicated in fipronil resistance in several insect species including P. xylostella. PxGABARα1 was previously mapped to the Z chromosome of P. xylostella. In conclusion, fipronil resistance in the HF-R strain of P. xylostella was incompletely dominant, and controlled by a major autosomal locus and a sex-linked minor gene (PxGABARα1) on the Z chromosome.",2016,"Shuwen Wu, Yidong Wu, Xingliang Wang, Weiyue Gao"
Multiple Genes Cause Postmating Prezygotic Reproductive Isolation in the Drosophila virilis Group,27729433,10.1534/g3.116.033340,"Understanding the genetic basis of speciation is a central problem in evolutionary biology. Studies of reproductive isolation have provided several insights into the genetic causes of speciation, especially in taxa that lend themselves to detailed genetic scrutiny. Reproductive barriers have usually been divided into those that occur before zygote formation (prezygotic) and after (postzygotic), with the latter receiving a great deal of attention over several decades. Reproductive barriers that occur after mating but before zygote formation [postmating prezygotic (PMPZ)] are especially understudied at the genetic level. Here, I present a phenotypic and genetic analysis of a PMPZ reproductive barrier between two species of the Drosophila virilis group: D. americana and D. virilis This species pair shows strong PMPZ isolation, especially when D. americana males mate with D. virilis females: ∼99% of eggs laid after these heterospecific copulations are not fertilized. Previous work has shown that the paternal loci contributing to this incompatibility reside on two chromosomes, one of which (chromosome 5) likely carries multiple factors. The other (chromosome 2) is fixed for a paracentric inversion that encompasses nearly half the chromosome. Here, I present two results. First, I show that PMPZ in this species cross is largely due to defective sperm storage in heterospecific copulations. Second, using advanced intercross and backcross mapping approaches, I identify genomic regions that carry genes capable of rescuing heterospecific fertilization. I conclude that paternal incompatibility between D. americana males and D. virilis females is underlain by four or more genes on chromosomes 2 and 5.",2016,Yasir H Ahmed-Braimah
Pervasive microRNA Duplication in Chelicerates: Insights from the Embryonic microRNA Repertoire of the Spider Parasteatoda tepidariorum,27324919,10.1093/gbe/evw143,"MicroRNAs are small (∼22 nt) noncoding RNAs that repress translation and therefore regulate the production of proteins from specific target mRNAs. microRNAs have been found to function in diverse aspects of gene regulation within animal development and many other processes. Among invertebrates, both conserved and novel, lineage specific, microRNAs have been extensively studied predominantly in holometabolous insects such as Drosophila melanogaster However little is known about microRNA repertoires in other arthropod lineages such as the chelicerates. To understand the evolution of microRNAs in this poorly sampled subphylum, we characterized the microRNA repertoire expressed during embryogenesis of the common house spider Parasteatoda tepidariorum We identified a total of 148 microRNAs in P. tepidariorum representing 66 families. Approximately half of these microRNA families are conserved in other metazoans, while the remainder are specific to this spider. Of the 35 conserved microRNAs families 15 had at least two copies in the P. tepidariorum genome. A BLAST-based approach revealed a similar pattern of duplication in other spiders and a scorpion, but not among other chelicerates and arthropods, with the exception of a horseshoe crab. Among the duplicated microRNAs we found examples of lineage-specific tandem duplications, and the duplication of entire microRNA clusters in three spiders, a scorpion, and in a horseshoe crab. Furthermore, we found that paralogs of many P. tepidariorum microRNA families exhibit arm switching, which suggests that duplication was often followed by sub- or neofunctionalization. Our work shows that understanding the evolution of microRNAs in the chelicerates has great potential to provide insights into the process of microRNA duplication and divergence and the evolution of animal development.",2016,"Saad Arif, Maarten Hilbrant, Sam Griffiths-Jones, Matthew Ronshaugen, Maria Ninova, Alistair P McGregor, Daniel J Leite"
"Effects of human food grade titanium dioxide nanoparticle dietary exposure on Drosophila melanogaster survival, fecundity, pupation and expression of antioxidant genes",26344147,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2015.08.054,"The fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster was exposed to the human food grade of E171 titanium dioxide (TiO2). This is a special grade of TiO2 which is frequently omitted in nanotoxicology studies dealing with TiO2, yet it is the most relevant grade regarding oral exposure of humans. D. melanogaster larvae were exposed to 0.002 mg mL(-1), 0.02 mg mL(-1), 0.2 mg mL(-1), and 2 mg mL(-1) of TiO2 in feeding medium, and the survival, fecundity, pupation time, and expression of genes involved in oxidative stress response were monitored. TiO2 did not affect survival but significantly increased time to pupation (p < 0.001). Fecundity of D. melanogaster was unaffected by the treatment. Expression of the gene for catalase was markedly downregulated by the treatment, while the effect on the downregulation of superoxide dismutase 2 was less pronounced. After four days of dietary exposure TiO2 was present in a significant amount in larvae, but was not transferred to adults during metamorphosis. Two individuals with aberrant phenotype similar to previously described gold nanoparticles induced mutant phenotypes were detected in the group exposed to TiO2. In general, TiO2 showed little toxicity toward D. melanogaster at concentrations relevant to oral exposure of humans.",2016,"Tatjana Lj Mitrović, Vladimir J Cvetković, Boris Jovanović"
A genetic algorithm-based weighted ensemble method for predicting transposon-derived piRNAs,27578422,10.1186/s12859-016-1206-3,"Background: Predicting piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) is an important topic in the small non-coding RNAs, which provides clues for understanding the generation mechanism of gamete. To the best of our knowledge, several machine learning approaches have been proposed for the piRNA prediction, but there is still room for improvements. Results: In this paper, we develop a genetic algorithm-based weighted ensemble method for predicting transposon-derived piRNAs. We construct datasets for three species: Human, Mouse and Drosophila. For each species, we compile the balanced dataset and imbalanced dataset, and thus obtain six datasets to build and evaluate prediction models. In the computational experiments, the genetic algorithm-based weighted ensemble method achieves 10-fold cross validation AUC of 0.932, 0.937 and 0.995 on the balanced Human dataset, Mouse dataset and Drosophila dataset, respectively, and achieves AUC of 0.935, 0.939 and 0.996 on the imbalanced datasets of three species. Further, we use the prediction models trained on the Mouse dataset to identify piRNAs of other species, and the models demonstrate the good performances in the cross-species prediction. Conclusions: Compared with other state-of-the-art methods, our method can lead to better performances. In conclusion, the proposed method is promising for the transposon-derived piRNA prediction.

Inbreeding removes sex differences in lifespan in a population of Drosophila melanogaster,27354712,10.1098/rsbl.2016.0337,"Sex differences in ageing rates and lifespan are common in nature, and an enduring puzzle for evolutionary biology. One possibility is that sex-specific mortality rates may result from recessive deleterious alleles in 'unguarded' heterogametic X or Z sex chromosomes (the unguarded X hypothesis). Empirical evidence for this is, however, limited. Here, we test a fundamental prediction of the unguarded X hypothesis in Drosophila melanogaster, namely that inbreeding shortens lifespan more in females (the homogametic sex in Drosophila) than in males. To test for additional sex-specific social effects, we studied the lifespan of males and females kept in isolation, in related same-sex groups, and in unrelated same-sex groups. As expected, outbred females outlived outbred males and inbreeding shortened lifespan. However, inbreeding-mediated reductions in lifespan were stronger for females, such that lifespan was similar in inbred females and males. We also show that the social environment, independent of inbreeding, affected male, but not female lifespan. In conjunction with recent studies, the present results suggest that asymmetric inheritance mechanisms may play an important role in the evolution of sex-specific lifespan and that social effects must be considered explicitly when studying these fundamental patterns.",2016,"Stuart Wigby, Irem Sepil, Tommaso Pizzari, Pau Carazo, Jared Green"
Determination of EGFR Signaling Output by Opposing Gradients of BMP and JAK/STAT Activity,27593379,10.1016/j.cub.2016.07.073,"A relatively small number of signaling pathways drive a wide range of developmental decisions, but how this versatility in signaling outcome is generated is not clear. In the Drosophila follicular epithelium, localized epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation induces distinct cell fates depending on its location. Posterior follicle cells respond to EGFR activity by expressing the T-box transcription factors Midline and H15, while anterior cells respond by expressing the homeodomain transcription factor Mirror. We show that the choice between these alternative outputs of EGFR signaling is regulated by antiparallel gradients of JAK/STAT and BMP pathway activity and that mutual repression between Midline/H15 and Mirror generates a bistable switch that toggles between alternative EGFR signaling outcomes. JAK/STAT and BMP pathway input is integrated through their joint and opposing regulation of both sides of this switch. By converting this positional information into a binary decision between EGFR signaling outcomes, this regulatory network ultimately allows the same ligand-receptor pair to establish both the anterior-posterior (AP) and dorsal-ventral (DV) axes of the tissue.",2016,"Josée Houde, Mariana Fregoso Lomas, Scott De Vito, Laura A Nilson, Jean-François Boisclair Lachance"
Molecular structure of the transposable element ninja in Drosophila simulans,8925473,10.1266/ggs.71.1,"Genetically unstable DNA sequences of 16.1 kb in length were isolated from the white locus of the W(mky) strain of Drosophila simulans.

In order to determine the structure of the insert as whole and the functional unit as a transposon, we analyzed nine clones isolated from genomic libraries of W(psm1) and W(cho). The repeating unit of the 16.1 kb insertion was the retrotransposon ninja and the DNA sequence of the entire element was determined. The ninja transposon is 6644 bp in length, with a 316 bp long terminal repeat (LTR) on each end. It contains two openreading frames (ORFs), and the pol region is divided between the two ORFs in contrast the organization of other retrotransposons.

Actin-encoding cDNAs and gene expression during the intermolt cycle of the Bermuda land crab Gecarcinus lateralis,8666269,10.1016/0378-1119(96)00018-2,"Two actin-encoding cDNAs (act1 and act2) from Gecarcinus lateralis have been sequenced or partially sequenced and the corresponding proteins deduced. The act1 cDNA has a complete ORF; the act2 cDNA lacks most of the 5' end of the coding region. The nucleotide (nt) sequences of both clones are very similar to act sequences of many organisms, the most closely related being from another arthropod, the silkmoth Bombyx mori. The proteins Act1 and Act2 are more similar to vertebrate cytoplasmic actin isoforms (beta-actins) than to vertebrate muscle actins (alpha-actins); they are also more similar to animal actins than to those of fungi or plants. Codon usage is strongly biased toward C or G in the third position. The deduced number of amino acid (aa) residues and calculated Mr for Act1 are 376 aa and 41.94 kDa, respectively. The deduced aa sequence of Act1 is very similar to those of muscle actins of B. mori and Drosophila melanogaster. Southern blots indicated seven to eleven act genes in the crab genome. Northern blots probed with a segment from the 3' UTR of act1 showed a single band of approx. 1.6 kb in poly(A)+ mRNAs from epidermis, limb bud or claw muscle and in total RNAs from ovary and gill, and two bands of approx. 1.6 and 1.8 kb in total RNA from midgut gland. Western blots of one-dimensional gels of proteins from the four layers of the exoskeleton, epidermis, limb buds and claw muscle were probed with a monoclonal Ab against chicken gizzard actin; tissue- and stage-specific changes in actin content were observed.

Differences in crossover frequency and distribution among three sibling species of Drosophila,8852849,,"Comparisons of the genetic and cytogenetic maps of three sibling species of Drosophila reveal marked differences in the frequency and cumulative distribution of crossovers during meiosis. The maps for two of these species, Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans, have previously been described, while this report presents new map data for D. mauritiana, obtained using a set of P element markers. A genetic map covering nearly the entire genome was constructed by estimating the recombination fraction for each pair of adjacent inserts. The P-based genetic map of mauritiana is approximately 1.8 times longer than the standard melanogaster map. It appears that mauritiana has higher recombination along the entire length of each chromosome, but the difference is greates in centromere-proximal regions of the autosomes. The mauritiana autosomes show little or no centromeric recombinational suppression, a characteristic that is prominent in melanogaster. D. simulans appears to be intermediate both in terms of total map length and intensity of the autosomal centromeric effect. These interspecific differences in recombination have important evolutionary implications for DNA sequence organization and variability. In particular, mauritiana is expected to differ from melanogaster in patterns and amounts of sequence variation and transposon insertions.",1996,"C C Laurie, J M Mercer, J R True"
Kinesin-related proteins in the mammalian testes: candidate motors for meiosis and morphogenesis,8688559,10.1091/mbc.7.2.289,"The kinesin superfamily of molecular motors comprises proteins that participate in a wide variety of motile events within the cell. Members of this family share a highly homologous head domain responsible for force generation attached to a divergent tail domain thought to couple the motor domain to its target cargo. Many kinesin-related proteins (KRPs) participate in spindle morphogenesis and chromosome movement in cell division. Genetic analysis of mitotic KRPs in yeast and Drosophila, as well as biochemical experiments in other species, have suggested models for the function of KRPs in cell division, including both mitosis and meiosis. Although many mitotic KRPs have been identified, the relationship between mitotic motors and meiotic function is not clearly understood. We have used sequence similarity between mitotic KRPs to identify candidates for meiotic and/or mitotic motors in a vertebrate. We have identified a group of kinesin-related proteins from rat testes (termed here testes KRP1 through KRP6) that includes new members of the bimC and KIF2 subfamilies as well as proteins that may define new kinesin subfamilies. Five of the six testes KRPs identified are expressed primarily in testes. Three of these are expressed in a region of the seminiferous epithelia (SE) rich in meiotically active cells. Further characterization of one of these KRPs, KRP2, showed it to be a promising candidate for a motor in meiosis: it is localized to a meiotically active region of the SE and is homologous to motor proteins associated with the mitotic apparatus. Testes-specific genes provide the necessary probes to investigate whether the motor proteins that function in mammalian meiosis overlap with those of mitosis and whether motor proteins exist with functions unique to meiosis. Our search for meiotic motors in a vertebrate testes has successfully identified proteins with properties consistent with those of meiotic motors in addition to uncovering proteins that may function in other unique motile events of the SE.",1996,"L P Zhao, A O Sperry"
Protein-protein and protein-DNA interaction regions within the DNA end-binding protein Ku70-Ku86,8756676,10.1128/mcb.16.9.5186,"DNA ends are generated during double-strand-break repair and recombination. A p70-p86 heterodimer, Ku, accounts for the DNA end binding activity in eukaryotic cell extracts. When one or both subunits of Ku are missing, mammalian cells are deficient in double-strand-break repair and in specialized recombination, such as V(D)J recombination. Little is known of which regions of Ku70 and Ku86 bind to each other to form the heterodimeric complex or of which regions are important for DNA end binding. We have done genetic and biochemical studies to examine the domains within the two subunits important for protein assembly and for DNA end binding. We found that the C-terminal 20-kDa region of Ku70 and the C-terminal 32-kDa region of Ku86 are important for subunit-subunit interaction. For DNA binding, full-length individual subunits are inactive, indicating that heterodimer assembly precedes DNA binding. DNA end binding activity by the heterodimer requires the C-terminal 40-kDa region of Ku70 and the C-terminal 45-kDa region of Ku86. Leucine zipper-like motifs in both subunits that have been suggested as the Ku70-Ku86 interaction domains do not appear to be the sites of such interaction because these are dispensable for both assembly and DNA end binding. On the basis of these studies, we have organized Ku70 into nine sequence regions conserved between Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Drosophila melanogaster, mice, and humans; only the C-terminal three regions are essential for assembly (amino acids [aa] 439 to 609), and the C-terminal four regions appear to be essential for DNA end binding (aa 254 to 609). Within the minimal active fragment of Ku86 necessary for subunit interaction (aa 449 to 732) and DNA binding (aa 334 to 732), a proline-rich region is the only defined motif.",1996,"M R Lieber, X Wu"
Spontaneous avoidance behavior in Drosophila null for calmodulin expression,8637889,10.1073/pnas.93.6.2420,"The regulatory protein calmodulin is a major mediator of calcium-induced changes in cellular activity. To analyze the roles of calmodulin in an intact animal, we have generated a calmodulin null mutation in Drosophila melanogaster. Maternal calmodulin supports calmodulin null individuals throughout embryogenesis, but they die within 2 days of hatching as first instar larvae. We have detected two pronounced behavioral abnormalities specific to the loss of calmodulin in these larvae. Swinging of the head and anterior body, which occurs in the presence of food, is three times more frequent in the null animals. More strikingly, most locomotion in calmodulin null larvae is spontaneous backward movement. This is in marked contrast to the wild-type situation where backward locomotion is seen only as a stimulus-elicited avoidance response. Our finding of spontaneous avoidance behavior has striking similarities to the enhanced avoidance responses produced by some calmodulin mutations in Paramecium. Thus our results suggest evolutionary conservation of a role for calmodulin in membrane excitability and linked behavioral responses.",1996,"K Beckingham, R G Heiman, C Bolduc, G E Kovalick, R C Atkinson, B F Andruss"
Modular organization of the PDZ domains in the human discs-large protein suggests a mechanism for coupling PDZ domain-binding proteins to ATP and the membrane cytoskeleton,8909548,10.1083/jcb.135.3.753,"The human homologue (hDIg) of the Drosophila discs-large tumor suppressor (DIg) is a multidomain protein consisting of a carboxyl-terminal guanylate kinase-like domain, an SH3 domain, and three slightly divergent copies of the PDZ (DHR/GLGF) domain. Here have examined the structural organization of the three PDZ domains of hDIg using a combination of protease digestion and in vitro binding measurements. Our results show that the PDZ domains are organized into two conformationally stable modules one (PDZ, consisting of PDZ domains 1 and 2, and the other (PDZ) corresponding to the third PDZ domain. Using amino acid sequencing and mass spectrometry, we determined the boundaries of the PDZ domains after digestion with endoproteinase Asp-N, trypsin, and alpha-chymotrypsin. The purified PDZ1+2, but not the PDZ3 domain, contains a high affinity binding site for the cytoplasmic domain of Shaker-type K+ channels. Similarly, we demonstrate that the PDZ1+2 domain can also specifically bind to ATP. Furthermore, we provide evidence for an in vivo interaction between hDIg and protein 4.1 and show that the hDIg protein contains a single high affinity protein 4.1-binding site that is not located within the PDZ domains. The results suggest a mechanism by which PDZ domain-binding proteins may be coupled to ATP and the membrane cytoskeleton via hDlg.",1996,"C Hough, S M Marfatia, J H Morais Cabral, A H Chishti, L Lin, L Stolz, P J Bryant"

Trisomy 21 or Down syndrome (DS) is the most frequent human birth defect. It is associated with mental retardation and a broad spectrum of physical abnormalities. A region on human chromosome 21 has been designated the Down syndrome critical region (DSCR) and when present in three copies, this is responsible for many of the characteristic features of DS, including mental retardation. We have isolated a human homologue of mnb from the DSCR. MNB encodes a 6.1 kb transcript which is expressed in foetal brain, lung, kidney and liver. Using a human probe, two major transcripts (6.1 and 3.1 kb) were identified in mouse and expression was detected in situ in several regions of the mouse brain, including the olfactory bulb, the cerebellum, the cerebral cortex, the pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus and several hypothalamic nuclei.

Est-P would be a ""cryptic"" pseudogene, in the sense that it retains intact the coding sequence (without stop codons and other alterations usually observed in pseudogenes) in most D. melanogaster strains.

Coexpression of Drosophila TRP and TRP-like proteins in Xenopus oocytes reconstitutes capacitative Ca2+ entry,8943075,10.1073/pnas.93.24.14146,"Capacitative Ca2+ entry is a component of the inositol-lipid signaling in which depletion of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3)-sensitive Ca2+ stores activates Ca2+ influx by a mechanism that is still unknown. This pathway plays a central role in cellular signaling, which is mediated by many hormones, neurotransmitters, and growth factors. Studies of Drosophila photoreceptors provided the first putative capacitative Ca2+ entry mutant designated transient receptor potential (trp) and a Drosophila gene encoding TRP-like protein (trpl). It is not clear how the Ca2+ store depletion signal is relayed to the plasma membrane and whether both TRP and TRPL participate in this process. We report here that coexpressing Drosophila TRP and TRPL in Xenopus oocytes synergistically enhances the endogenous Ca(2+)-activated Cl- current and produces a divalent inward current. Both of these currents are activated by Ca2+ store depletion. In the absence of Ca2+, Mg2+ is the main charge carrier of the divalent current. This current is characterized by lanthanum sensitivity and a voltage-dependent blocking effect of Mg2+, which is relieved at both hyperpolarizing (inward rectification) and depolarizing (outward rectification) potentials. The store-operated divalent current is neither observed in native oocytes nor in oocytes expressing either TRP or TRPL alone.

Neuroglian-mediated cell adhesion induces assembly of the membrane skeleton at cell contact sites,8636238,10.1083/jcb.133.3.647,"The protein ankyrin links integral membrane proteins to the spectrin-based membrane skeleton. Ankyrin is often concentrated within restricted membrane domains of polarized epithelia and neurons, but the mechanisms responsible for membrane targeting and its segregation within a continuous lipid bilayer remain unexplained. We provide evidence that neuroglian, a cell adhesion molecule related to L1 and neurofascin, can transmit positional information directly to ankyrin and thereby polarize its distribution in Drosophila S2 tissue culture cells. Ankyrin was not normally associated with the plasma membrane of these cells. Upon expression of an inducible neuroglian minigene, however, cells aggregated into large clusters and ankyrin became concentrated at sites of cell-cell contact. Spectrin was also recruited to sites of cell contact in response to neuroglian expression. The accumulation of ankyrin at cell contacts required the presence of the cytoplasmic domain of neuroglian since a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol-linked form of neuroglian failed to recruit ankyrin to sites of cell-cell contact. Double-labeling experiments revealed that, whereas ankyrin was strictly associated with sites of cell-cell contact, neuroglian was more broadly distributed over the cell surface. A direct interaction between neuroglian and ankyrin was demonstrated using yeast two-hybrid analysis. Thus, neuroglian appears to be activated by extracellular adhesion so that ankyrin and the membrane skeleton selectively associate with sites of cell contact and not with other regions of the plasma membrane.",1996,"G MacVicar, M Hortsch, D Homer, S Dissanayake, R R Dubreuil, C Liu"
Expression of the cCdx-B homeobox gene in chick embryo suggests its participation in rostrocaudal axial patterning,8853984,10.1002/(SICI)1097-0177(199608)206:4<343::AID-AJA1>3.0.CO;2-I,"cCdx-B (formerly cHox-cad 2) is a chick homeobox-containing gene related to the Drosophila caudal.

In the present study, we characterize the localization of cCdx-B transcripts to the caudal region of the embryo by using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and, in detail, by using in situ hybridization. Chick embryos from gastrulation to early organogenesis were hybridized with digoxigenin-labeled riboprobes, and the pattern of expression of cCdx-B mRNA was analyzed in wholemount embryos and in tissue sections. In the early gastrula, transcripts were localized in a gradient through the caudal half of the embryo, in the epiblast and the mesoderm cells, but not including Hensen's node. During neurulation, cCdx-B transcripts were found more rostrally, with high levels localized in Hensen's node and the posterior neural plate. Expression was also high in paraxial mesoderm, with a rostral limit in the most recently formed somite. There was no expression in definitive endoderm. During late neurulation and tail bud formation, cCdx-B mRNA expression regressed posteriorly and was finally confined to the tail bud region. This pattern of expression of cCdx-B, regulated in time and space, is different from that of the other known chick caudal homologue, cCdx-A.

Three second chromosome-linked clustered Cyp6 genes show differential constitutive and barbital-induced expression in DDT-resistant and susceptible strains of Drosophila melanogaster,8973362,10.1016/s0378-1119(96)00446-5,"The level of expression of the Cyp6a2 gene is much higher in the DDT-resistant 91-R strain than in the susceptible 91-C strain of Drosophila melanogaster (Waters et al.

To understand the role of Cyp6a2 and related genes in insecticide resistance, we have isolated and characterized two new Cyp6 genes from the 91-R strain. The polypeptides encoded by these two genes, Cyp6a8 and Cyp6a9, show 77 and 75% amino acid sequence similarity, and 60 and 55% identity with Cyp6a2 of D. melanogaster, respectively. In the genome, Cyp6a8 and Cyp6a9 genes are closely clustered within 4 kb and map at region 51C of the second chromosome. In between them another Cyp gene is present which is more related to Cyp6a9 than to Cyp6a8. The Cyp6a8 gene which is transcriptionally highly active in 91-R, moderately active in ry506 and silent in the 91-C strain hybridizes with 2.0- and 1.8-kb RNAs. Two different-sized RNAs, 2.1 and 1.8 kb, also hybridize with the Cyp6a9 and/or Cyp6a9-related genes. While the level of 2.1-kb RNA is similar in all three strains, the level of 1.8-kb RNA is highest in the 91-R strain and barely detectable in 91-C strain. Transgenic experiments showed that a 8.3-kb BamHI fragment contains the cis-regulatory elements for the expression of both Cyp6a8 and Cyp6a9-related genes. Barbital induces all these genes in all three strains and increases the levels of the two Cyp6a8 transcripts and the 1.8-kb RNA produced by the Cyp6a9 and/or Cyp6a9-related genes. Expression of the Cyp6a8 gene is down-regulated in the hybrids of 91-R and 91-C strains despite the fact that the hybrids carry one copy of the highly active allele of the Cyp6a8 gene of the 91-R strain. Based on these results we propose that the Cyp6a8 gene in 91-C strain may be turned off by an active repressor which might be inhibited by barbital treatment. In the 91-R strain, the putative repressor may be defective, allowing high level of constitutive expression of the Cyp6a8 gene.",1996,"L C Waters, S M Dombrowski, R Ganguly, S Maitra"
Variation in the number of activated torso receptors correlates with differential gene expression,8681811,,"Activation of receptor tyrosine kinases triggers many developmental decisions, yet we do not understand how activation of a single receptor can be transduced into different cell responses. The torso pathway in Drosophila provides a model to address this issue since it generates more than one response in the embryo. The torso receptor tyrosine kinase is activated at the embryonic poles under the control of trunk, a protein with similarities to several types of extracellular growth factors. Activation of torso is responsible for the development of a variety of structures, whose appearance can be correlated with activation of at least two different genes along the terminal region. In this study we have analyzed mutations in torso and trunk that express low levels of the respective proteins. We show that different amounts of torso or trunk molecules correlate with the expression of different zygotic genes, implicating changes in the number of activated torso molecules as one of the mechanisms defining differential gene expression. We suggest that variation in the number of activated receptors at the cell surface is a general mechanism that leads to differential gene expression and thus the generation of different cell responses.",1996,"F Sprenger, M Furriols, J Casanova"

Recovery and Characterization of Temperature-Sensitive Mutations Affecting Adult Viability in DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER,17246331,,"Temperature-sensitive (ts) autonomous cell-lethal mutations have been used extensively to study important developmental phenomena, such as pattern formation, in Drosophila. Their utility would be enhanced considerably if it were possible to establish which cell type is primarily affected by each lesion. To facilitate such an approach we have isolated and characterized 21 EMS- induced X-linked adult-lethal (adl) mutants, 16 of which are ts. Most of these lesions also elicit ts lethal effects during preimaginal development. They represent 19 different loci distributed randomly along the X chromosome. The general properties of these mutations are described. In addition, results of an in-depth analysis (focus mapping and, in some cases, temperature shift and heat-pulse studies) of four strains, adl-1(ts) (1), sesE, adl-2(ts) ( 1) and rex are reported. Two major temperature-sensitive periods (TSPs) of adl-1 lethality were resolved: one during the second half of embryogenesis and the other coinciding with pupariation. Mosaic analysis revealed separate mesodermal foci for leg paralysis. Developmental analysis of adl-1 embryos suggest that the adl-1 product may be required for maintenance of muscle tissue. Two discrete TSPs of sesE lethality exist: one during the second instar and the other extending from late third instar to early pupation. Mosaic analysis of sesE lethality resolved a pair of neural foci, each of which appears to incorporate three separate foci for leg paralysis. Mosaic analysis of adl-2(ts) ( 1) revealed the existence of paired lethal foci that appear to map to the vicinity of the subesophageal ganglion. Analysis of rex mosaics resolved separate mesodermal foci for leg paralysis.",1986,"T Homyk, D A Sinclair, D T Wong, T A Grigliatti"
Developmental expression of the Drosophila zeste gene and localization of zeste protein on polytene chromosomes,2853686,10.1101/gad.2.12b.1839,"The expression of the zeste gene varies through the life cycle of the fly. Its transcription is most abundant in maternal RNA, declines to very low levels during larval growth, but rises again in late third instar larvae and pupae. Using transposons containing a zeste-lacZ gene, we found a corresponding variation in the tissue distribution of zeste from stage to stage. Nearly ubiquitous expression of the zeste-lacZ gene is found in late embryos and first instar larvae, but disappears almost completely except in brain and gonads by third instar larva. Shortly before pupation expression rises again in imaginal discs, Malpighian tubules, and salivary glands and again becomes nearly ubiquitous in pupae. zeste continues to be expressed in adult brain and gonads. We constructed flies carrying a zeste gene controlled by the heat shock promoter and studied the distribution of zeste protein in their polytene chromosomes as well as those of wild-type flies. Using affinity-purified anti-zeste antibodies, we find that wild-type salivary gland chromosomes contain about 60 strong bands of zeste immunofluorescence at specific cytological locations. After heat induction of larvae containing the hs-zeste gene, many hundreds of bands appear. These results suggest the involvement of zeste in the expression of a wide variety of genes at different developmental stages.",1988,"V Pirrotta, C Mariani, S Bickel"
The Drosophila melanogaster tropomyosin II gene produces multiple proteins by use of alternative tissue-specific promoters and alternative splicing,2851721,10.1128/mcb.8.9.3591,"The structure of the Drosophila melanogaster tropomyosin II (TmII) gene has been determined by DNA sequencing of cDNA clones and the genomic DNA coding for the gene. Two overlapping transcriptional units produce at least four different tropomyosin isoforms. A combination of developmentally regulated promoters and alternative splicing produces both muscle and cytoskeletal tropomyosin isoforms. One promoter is a muscle-specific promoter and produces three different tropomyosin isoforms by alternative splicing of the last three 3' exons. The second promoter has the characteristics of a housekeeping promoter and produces a cytoskeletal tropomyosin isoform. Several internal exons along with a final 3' exon are alternatively spliced in the cytoskeletal transcript. The intron-exon boundaries of the TmII gene are identical to the intron-exon boundaries of all vertebrate tropomyosin genes reported, but are very different from the intron-exon boundaries of the D. melanogaster tropomyosin I gene. The TmII gene is the only reported tropomyosin gene that has two promoters and a quadruple alternative splice choice for the final exon. Models for the mechanism of D. melanogaster tropomyosin gene evolution are discussed.",1988,"P D Hanke, R V Storti"
Transposable and nontransposable elements similar to the I factor involved in inducer-reactive (IR) hybrid dysgenesis in Drosophila melanogaster coexist in various Drosophila species,2829216,10.1073/pnas.85.4.1141,"The I factor is a transposable element controlling inducer-reactive (IR) hybrid dysgenesis in Drosophila melanogaster, which occurs when males from the class of inducer strains are crossed with females from the class of reactive strains. Inducer strains contain several copies of the complete 5.4-kilobase (kb) I factor at various sites on the chromosomal arms; reactive strains contain no complete I factor. Incomplete and defective I elements occur at constant locations in pericentromeric heterochromatin of both types of strains. The 5.4-kb I factors transpose, whereas incomplete I elements do not transpose. The constant location of defective I elements in all strains indicates that they were in the genome before the spread of D. melanogaster throughout the world. Sequences homologous to I occur in other Drosophila species, and their distribution correlates with the phylogenetic relationships between species. We have studied the organization of I homologues in Drosophila simulans and Drosophila teissieri. These species seem to contain both transposable I elements, even though their structure may differ from that of the 5.4-kb I factors of the inducer strains of D. melanogaster, and nontransposable I elements, which are always at the same place in the genome when different stocks of the same species are compared. These results suggest that both mobile and nonmobile I elements are very old components of the Drosophilidae genome.",1988,"M Simonelig, A Bucheton, A Pelisson, C Bazin"
"The location, modification, and function of the fushi tarazu protein during Drosophila embryogenesis",3146065,,"The fushi tarazu (ftz) protein of Drosophila is required during embryogenesis for the process of body segmentation. In order to study the biochemical properties of the ftz protein, ftz cDNA was expressed in E. coli, and the protein purified to homogeneity. Polyclonal antibodies raised against the purified protein were used to localize and quantitate the protein during embryogenesis. Three temporally and spatially distinct phases of expression were observed, which include a previously undetected period later in embryogenesis. During this last phase, the protein is localized in the developing hindgut. Analysis of embryonic ftz protein on Western blots permitted us to approximate the number of protein molecules per nucleus. During the blastoderm phase of development, when ftz protein is most abundant, we calculate that there are 15,000 molecules of protein per ftz-expressing nucleus. Since embryonic ftz protein migrates more slowly on SDS polyacrylamide gels than protein expressed either in E. coli, or in vitro in a reticulocyte lysate system, it is apparently modified in the embryo. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by Western blotting resolves the protein into a series of isoforms which have variable charge and electrophoretic mobility. When compared in its ability to bind DNA in a sequence-specific manner, it was also found that ftz protein partially purified from embryos binds with greater specificity than its bacterially expressed counterpart. In this paper, we demonstrate that embryonic ftz protein binds to a specific region within the ftz enhancer element. The potential relationship between these observations is discussed.",1988,"H M Krause, W J Gehring"
Inhibition of tyrosine sulfation in the trans-Golgi retards the transport of a constitutively secreted protein to the cell surface,3182933,10.1083/jcb.107.5.1655,"The effect of tyrosine sulfation on the transport of a constitutively secreted protein, yolk protein 2 (YP2) of Drosophila melanogaster, to the cell surface was investigated after expression of YP2 in mouse fibroblasts. Inhibition of YP2 sulfation was achieved by two distinct approaches. First, the single site of sulfation in YP2, tyrosine 172, was changed to phenylalanine by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. Second, L cell clones stably expressing YP2 were treated with chlorate, a reversible inhibitor of sulfation. Pulse-chase experiments with transfected L cell clones showed that the half-time of transport from the rough endoplasmic reticulum to the cell surface of the unsulfated mutant YP2 and the unsulfated wild-type YP2 produced in the presence of chlorate was 15-18 min slower than that of the sulfated wild-type YP2. Control experiments indicated (a) that the tyrosine to phenylalanine change itself did not affect YP2 transport, (b) that the retardation of YP2 transport by chlorate occurred only with sulfatable but not with unsulfatable YP2, (c) that the transport difference between wild-type and mutant YP2 was not due to the level of YP2 expression, and (d) that transport of the endogenous secretory protein fibronectin was the same in L cell clones expressing wild-type and mutant YP2. Since the half-time of transport of wild-type YP2 from the intracellular site of sulfation, the trans-Golgi, to the cell surface was found to be 10 min, the 15-18-min retardation seen upon inhibition of tyrosine sulfation reflected a two- to threefold increase in the half-time of trans-Golgi to cell surface transport, which was most probably caused by an increased residence time of unsulfated YP2 in the trans-Golgi. The results demonstrate a role of tyrosine sulfation in the intracellular transport of a constitutively secreted protein.",1988,"E Friederich, W B Huttner, H J Fritz"
"A novel, tissue-specific, Drosophila homeobox gene",2901348,,"The homeobox gene family of Drosophila appears to control a variety of position-specific patterning decisions during embryonic and imaginal development. Most of these patterning decisions determine groups of cells on the anterior-posterior axis of the Drosophila germ band. We have isolated a novel homeobox gene from Drosophila, designated H2.0. H2.0 has the most diverged homeobox so far characterized in metazoa, and, in contrast to all previously isolated homeobox genes, H2.0 exhibits a tissue-specific pattern of expression. The cells that accumulate transcripts for this novel gene correspond to the visceral musculature and its anlagen.",1988,"R Chadwick, M Barad, W McGinnis, T Jack"

A gum Arabic assisted sustainable drug delivery system for adult Drosophila,32487516,10.1242/bio.052241,"Large-scale compound screening in adult flies is hampered by the lack of continuous drug delivery systems and poor solubility of numerous compounds. Here we found that gum Arabic (Acacia/Senegal gum), a widely used stabilizer, can also emulsify lipophilic compounds and profoundly increase their accessibility to target tissues in Drosophila and mice. We further developed a gum Arabic-based drug delivery system, wherein the drug was ground into gum Arabic and emulsified in liquid food fed to flies by siphoning through a U-shape glass capillary. This system did not affect food intake nor cell viability. Since drugs were continuously delivered by siphoning, minimal compound waste and less frequent food changes make this system ideal for large-scale long-term screenings. In our pilot screening for antitumor drugs in the NCI DTP library, we used a Drosophila model of colorectal cancer and identified two drugs that are especially hydrophobic and were not identified in previous screenings. Our data demonstrated that gum Arabic facilitates drug delivery in animal models and the system is suitable for long-term high-throughput drug screening in Drosophila This system would accelerate drug discovery for chronic and cognitive conditions.",2020,"Ruolei Han, Yao Zhang, Qi Zhang, Qiying Liang, Hansong Deng, Saifei Wang, Peng Ma, Ping Wang, Youjie Yin"

Through single-cell RNA sequencing, we identify fourteen hemocyte clusters present in unchallenged larvae and associated with distinct processes, e.g., proliferation, phagocytosis, metabolic homeostasis, and humoral response. Finally, we characterize the changes occurring in the hemocyte clusters upon wasp infestation, which triggers the differentiation of a novel hemocyte type, the lamellocyte.

Decoupling of Apoptosis from Activation of the ER Stress Response by the Drosophila Metallopeptidase superdeath,32047096,10.1534/genetics.119.303004,"Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced apoptosis is a primary cause and modifier of degeneration in a number of genetic disorders. Understanding how genetic variation influences the ER stress response and subsequent activation of apoptosis could improve individualized therapies and predictions of outcomes for patients. In this study, we find that the uncharacterized, membrane-bound metallopeptidase CG14516 in Drosophila melanogaster, which we rename as SUPpressor of ER stress-induced DEATH (su per death), plays a role in modifying ER stress-induced apoptosis. We demonstrate that loss of su per death reduces apoptosis and degeneration in the Rh1G69D model of ER stress through the JNK signaling cascade. This effect on apoptosis occurs without altering the activation of the unfolded protein response (IRE1 and PERK), suggesting that the beneficial prosurvival effects of this response are intact. Furthermore, we show that su per death functions epistatically upstream of CDK5-a known JNK-activated proapoptotic factor in this model of ER stress. We demonstrate that su per death is not only a modifier of this particular model, but affects the general tolerance to ER stress, including ER stress-induced apoptosis. Finally, we present evidence of Superdeath localization to the ER membrane. While similar in sequence to a number of human metallopeptidases found in the plasma membrane and ER membrane, its localization suggests that su per death is orthologous to ERAP1/2 in humans. Together, this study provides evidence that su per death is a link between stress in the ER and activation of cytosolic apoptotic pathways.",2020,"Hans M Dalton, Clement Y Chow, Rebecca A S Palu"
Reducing toxicity and antimicrobial activity of a pesticide mixture via photo-Fenton in different aqueous matrices using iron complexes,32927549,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.140152,"This is the first study to investigate ethylenediamine-N,N'-disuccinic acid (EDDS)/photo-Fenton process to polish real wastewater containing pesticides for possible water reuse. To this end, simultaneous degradation of pesticides ametrine, atrazine, imidacloprid and tebuthiuron was evaluated in distilled water (DW) and in sewage treatment plant (STP) effluent at initial pH 6.0. Several operational parameters (Fe3+-EDDS concentration, Fe3+-EDDS molar ratio, EDDS addition patterns and radiation source) were evaluated. 80-98% removal of target pesticides were obtained in DW using 30 μmol L-1 of Fe3+-EDDS with a molar ratio of 1:2 (300 μmol L-1 of H2O2). In addition, the proposed Fe3+-EDDS photo-Fenton at pH 6 was more efficient than classic photo-Fenton at pH 2.7 (30-84% removal). Experiments conducted in the presence of radical trapping agents (2-propanol or chloroform) revealed that HO• was the most active radical during treatment. Matrix composition strongly affected the degradation of target pesticides as a six-fold higher concentration of reagents (180 μmol L-1 of Fe3+-EDDS and 1800 μmol L-1 of H2O2) was needed to reach the same efficiency in STP compared to DW. Even so, first order rate constants corresponding to the degradation of pesticides in DW (k = 0.098-0.85 min-1) were nearly two-fold higher than in STP (k = 0.079-0.49 min-1) under the same radiation source (black-light or solar radiation). Finally, acute toxicity towards Vibrio fischeri and Drosophila melanogaster flies, and antibacterial activity assessed for Escherichia coli were eliminated after the application of the proposed treatment, thus indicating environmental safety for either discharge or reuse of treated wastewater for crop irrigation in agriculture.",2020,"Carlos Ueira-Vieira, Letícia L Batista, Ronaldo O Guimarães, Alam G Trovó, Maria Clara V M Starling, Bárbara R Gonçalves"
Paternal inheritance of diet induced metabolic traits correlates with germline regulation of diet induced coding gene expression,30986426,10.1016/j.ygeno.2019.04.008,"Inheritance of induced traits through the germline is poorly understood and controversial. The ideal evidence correlating induced and inherited traits with germline gene expression remains largely obscure. Using a Drosophila coding transcriptome level model of paternal high sugar diet induced alterations in triglyceride levels across generations, in conjunction with pre-existing data, we show here highly significant overlap of differentially expressed genes between the ancestral generation, the resulting sperm and embryos, and the future generation individuals. Further, gene ontology and literature-wide overrepresentation analysis reveal association of lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, and immune response, besides others, with differentially expressed genes in the above samples. Analysis of available mouse data on inheritance of diet induced metabolic traits also revealed a similar correlation. Our results support a causal role of sperm borne mRNAs in inheritance of acquired characteristics, consistent with the evidence that these mRNAs are delivered to the oocyte and influence embryonic development.",2020,"Ameek Bhalla, Abhay Sharma, Manoj Teltumbade"
Distribution of S-phase cells during the regeneration of Drosophila imaginal wing discs,3098601,10.1016/0012-1606(87)90215-6,"We investigated the distribution of S-phase cells during regeneration of the imaginal wing disc of Drosophila melanogaster following excision of 30 degrees, 90 degrees, and 150 degrees sectors of tissue. The fragments were cultured in adult abdomens for 1-5 days, labeled in vitro with tritiated thymidine, serially sectioned, and subjected to autoradiography. There was negligible thymidine incorporation in unoperated controls and in the undamaged parts of the operated discs, indicating that DNA synthesis in undamaged tissue is terminated during the first day of the culture period. Almost all of the fragments from which tissue had been removed, as well as controls which were simply cut without the removal of any tissue, showed a cluster of labeled cells (blastema) even after only 1 day of culture. The blastemas in control discs were short-lived, with over 50% of these discs showing no blastema by the third day in culture. Blastemas in discs from which sectors were removed were more persistent; the time at which 50% of the fragments no longer showed a blastema was 4 days for the -30 degrees fragments, 5 days for the -90 degrees fragments, and greater than 5 days for the -150 degrees fragments. The average blastema size, measured as number of labeled cells, was directly related to the amount of tissue removed, and in most cases did not change significantly during the culture period. Both wound edges incorporated tritiated thymidine initially and the S-phase cells remained tightly clustered throughout regeneration; maximum blastema width varied from about 8 to 25 cell diameters. The results are consistent with the idea that regenerative cell proliferation is stimulated and maintained by positional information discontinuities, and terminated when these discontinuities are resolved by the addition of an appropriate number of new cells.",1987,"P J Bryant, D A O'Brochta"

These experiments localized both pero1 and pers to a 1.7-kilobase DNA fragment that is mostly coding DNA. Sequencing of this subsegment from each mutant showed that pero1 is completely accounted for by a nonsense mutation in the third coding exon of a 4.5-kilobase RNA transcribed from this locus. The pers mutation is also a single nucleotide substitution, in the fourth coding exon, which results in a serine-to-asparagine substitution in the per gene protein product.

A transposable P vector that confers selectable G418 resistance to Drosophila larvae,16453599,,Drosophila larvae are rapidly killed by food containing the antibiotic G418.

We have constructed a vector for P-mediated transformation which uses this finding to allow dominant selection of transformed progeny. Features of this vector also facilitate cloning and allow the rapid recovery of the inserted transposon from transformed flies.
