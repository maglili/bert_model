Molecular heterogeneity of naturally occurring sn-glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase low-activity variants in Drosophila melanogaster,7993372,10.1007/BF00554620,"Northern analyses of two low-activity sn-glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gpdh) alleles extracted from natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster showed that one of them, GpdhACyg22, produced wild-type levels of a normal sized (1.7-kb) mRNA but the other, GpdhAMB5, had very low levels of a 1.7-kb mRNA together with low levels of a transcript 200 bp larger. The two variant genes were cloned and sequenced. Compared with normal activity alleles, there were two nucleotide differences in the DNA sequence of GpdhACyg22 which were in first-codon positions and would be expected to give rise to Asn-13-->Tyr and Arg-272-->Cys substitutions. The second of these changes is most likely to account for the altered properties of the enzyme. In contrast, none of the nucleotide differences in GpdhAMB5 would give rise to amino acid substitutions, but a 76-bp deletion in the 5' region removed the normal TATA box and there was a 20-bp insertion in the same region. One of the two transcripts was derived from the use of a substitute TATA box sequence in the insertion, but the 1.9-kb transcript had heterogeneous 5' ends that were not associated with substitute TATA box sequences. The two transcripts either are produced at a lower rate or are less stable than the normal mRNA.",1994,"D S Reed, J B Gibson"
Blocked endocytotic uptake by the oocyte causes accumulation of vitellogenins in the haemolymph of the female-sterile mutants quitPX61 and stand stillPS34 of Drosophila,8111838,10.1007/BF00319427,"The developmental lesions in two female-sterile mutants, quitPX61 (qui) and stand stillPS34 (stil), of Drosophila have been analysed. Previtellogenic development is normal in mutant qui ovarioles but, during vitellogenic stages, only small quantities of yolk accumulate in the oocyte. The nurse-cell cytoplasm does not stream into the oocyte. However, the follicle cells continue their developmental program and synthesize an excessive quantity of eggshell material. In the mutant stil, the oocyte remains small and contains only a fraction of the yolk proteins present in wild-type follicles. Histological and ultrastructural observations and the failure to incorporate trypan blue indicate that the yolk proteins present in the mutant follicles are neither derived from the fat body nor from the follicle cells. Since, in both mutants, the uptake mechanism of vitellogenin is affected, the 3 polypeptides accumulate in the haemolymph (in stil, the protein concentration is up to 4 times higher than in wild-type females) and the haemolymph volume increases. Reciprocal transplantations of ovarioles show that the developmental lesions in both mutants are ovary-autonomous. Furthermore, genetic chimeras of stil show that the activity of the stil gene is required in the germline cells and not in the somatic tissues.",1994,"D Arendt, H O Gutzeit"
Insertional mutagenesis of Drosophila heterochromatin with single P elements,8170943,10.1073/pnas.91.9.3539,"Insertional mutagenesis with transposable P elements has greatly facilitated the identification and analysis of genes located throughout the 70% of the Drosophila melanogaster genome classified as euchromatin. In contrast, genetically marked P elements have only rarely been shown to transpose into heterochromatin. By carrying out single P element insertional mutagenesis under conditions where position-effect variegation was suppressed, we efficiently generated strains containing insertions at diverse sites within centromeric and Y-chromosome heterochromatin. The tendency of P elements to transpose locally was shown to operate within heterochromatin, and it further enhanced the recovery of heterochromatic insertions. Three of the insertions disrupted vital genes known to be present at low density in heterochromatin. Strains containing single P element insertions will greatly facilitate the structural and functional analysis of this poorly understood genomic component.",1994,"P Zhang, A C Spradling"
"CDK inhibitors suppress apoptosis induced by chemicals and by excessive expression of a cell death gene, reaper, in Drosophila cells",11303913,10.1023/a:1009641613826,"The present study was aimed to investigate whether or not cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) participate in different cascades leading to apoptosis. We examined the effects of two CDK inhibitors, olomoucine (OLM) and butyrolactone-I (BL-I), on apoptosis induced in two kinds of Drosophila cell lines. Increases of caspase activity induced by actinomycin D, cycloheximide, H-7 or A23187 in a Drosophila neuronal cell line, ML-DmBG2-c2, and induced by excessive expression of a Drosophila cell death gene, reaper, in Drosophila S2 cells were suppressed by 24-h pretreatment of each CDK inhibitor. Concomitant with the suppression of the caspase activity, fragmentations of cells and DNA, representatives of apoptosis, were also inhibited. These results suggest that CDK(s) participates in progression of apoptosis. However, these effects of the CDK inhibitors were also observed even at lower doses which did not affect cell proliferation. Therefore, it was shown that apoptosis is not always related to cell cycle in Drosophila cells. It was also suggested that the target(s) of the CDK inhibitors locates upstream of caspase in the cascade(s) of apoptosis.",2000,"K Ui-Tei, Z Piao, Y Miyata, H Suzuki, M Nagano"
Quaternary structure of nucleoside diphosphate kinases,11768306,10.1023/a:1005580828141,"Nucleoside (NDP) diphosphate kinases are oligomeric enzymes. Most are hexameric, but some bacterial enzymes are tetrameric. Hexamers and tetramers are constructed by assembling identical dimers. The hexameric structure is important for protein stability, as demonstrated by studies with natural mutants (the Killer-of-prune mutant of Drosophila NDP kinase and the S120G mutant of the human NDP kinase A in neuroblastomas) and with mutants obtained by site-directed mutagenesis. It is also essential for enzymic activity. The function of the tetrameric structure is unclear.",2000,"M Erent, S Ransac, L Lascu, A Giartosio"
The maternal effect mutation sésame affects the formation of the male pronucleus in Drosophila melanogaster,10837127,10.1006/dbio.2000.9718,"After entering the oocyte and before the formation of the diploid zygote, the sperm nucleus is transformed into a male pronucleus, a process that involves a series of conserved steps in sexually reproducing animals. Notably, a major modification of the male gamete lies in the decondensation of the highly compact sperm chromatin. We present here the phenotype of sésame (ssm), a maternal effect mutation which affects the formation of the male pronucleus in Drosophila melanogaster. Homozygous ssm(185b) females produce haploid embryos which develop with only the maternally derived chromosomes. These haploid embryos die at the end of embryogenesis. Cytological analyses of the fertilization in eggs laid by ssm(185b) mutant females showed that both pronuclear migration and pronuclear apposition occurred normally. However, a dramatic alteration of the male pronucleus by which its chromatin failed to fully decondense was systematically observed. Consequently, the affected male pronucleus does not enter the first mitotic spindle, which is organized around only the maternally derived chromosomes. Immunodetection of lamina antigens indicates that a male pronuclear envelope is able to form around the partially decondensed paternal chromatin. This suggests that the maternally provided sésame(+) function is required for a late stage of sperm chromatin remodeling.",2000,"M Docquier, P Couble, B Loppin, F Bonneton"
"Mutant human torsinA, responsible for early-onset dystonia, dominantly suppresses GTPCH expression, dopamine levels and locomotion in Drosophila melanogaster",25887123,10.1242/bio.201411080,"Dystonia represents the third most common movement disorder in humans with over 20 genetic loci identified. TOR1A (DYT1), the gene responsible for the most common primary hereditary dystonia, encodes torsinA, an AAA ATPase family protein. Most cases of DYT1 dystonia are caused by a 3 bp (ΔGAG) deletion that results in the loss of a glutamic acid residue (ΔE302/303) in the carboxyl terminal region of torsinA. This torsinAΔE mutant protein has been speculated to act in a dominant-negative manner to decrease activity of wild type torsinA. Drosophila melanogaster has a single torsin-related gene, dtorsin. Null mutants of dtorsin exhibited locomotion defects in third instar larvae. Levels of dopamine and GTP cyclohydrolase (GTPCH) proteins were severely reduced in dtorsin-null brains. Further, the locomotion defect was rescued by the expression of human torsinA or feeding with dopamine. Here, we demonstrate that human torsinAΔE dominantly inhibited locomotion in larvae and adults when expressed in neurons using a pan-neuronal promoter Elav. Dopamine and tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) levels were significantly reduced in larval brains and the expression level of GTPCH protein was severely impaired in adult and larval brains. When human torsinA and torsinAΔE were co-expressed in neurons in dtorsin-null larvae and adults, the locomotion rates and the expression levels of GTPCH protein were severely reduced. These results support the hypothesis that torsinAΔE inhibits wild type torsinA activity. Similarly, neuronal expression of a Drosophila DtorsinΔE equivalent mutation dominantly inhibited larval locomotion and GTPCH protein expression. These results indicate that both torsinAΔE and DtorsinΔE act in a dominant-negative manner. We also demonstrate that Dtorsin regulates GTPCH expression at the post-transcriptional level. This Drosophila model of DYT1 dystonia provides an important tool for studying the differences in the molecular function between the wild type and the mutant torsin proteins.",2015,"Olugbenga M Doherty, Naoto Ito, Janis M O'Donnell, Noriko Wakabayashi-Ito, Rami R Ajjuri, Benjamin W Henderson, Xandra O Breakefield"
Dissociation of mitochondrial from sarcoplasmic reticular stress in Drosophila cardiomyopathy induced by molecularly distinct mitochondrial fusion defects,25555803,10.1016/j.yjmcc.2014.12.018,"Mitochondrial dynamism (fusion and fission) is responsible for remodeling interconnected mitochondrial networks in some cell types. Adult cardiac myocytes lack mitochondrial networks, and their mitochondria are inherently ""fragmented"". Mitochondrial fusion/fission is so infrequent in cardiomyocytes as to not be observable under normal conditions, suggesting that mitochondrial dynamism may be dispensable in this cell type. However, we previously observed that cardiomyocyte-specific genetic suppression of mitochondrial fusion factors optic atrophy 1 (Opa1) and mitofusin/MARF evokes cardiomyopathy in Drosophila hearts. We posited that fusion-mediated remodeling of mitochondria may be critical for cardiac homeostasis, although never directly observed. Alternately, we considered that inner membrane Opa1 and outer membrane mitofusin/MARF might have other as-yet poorly described roles that affect mitochondrial and cardiac function. Here we compared heart tube function in three models of mitochondrial fragmentation in Drosophila cardiomyocytes: Drp1 expression, Opa1 RNAi, and mitofusin MARF RNA1. Mitochondrial fragmentation evoked by enhanced Drp1-mediated fission did not adversely impact heart tube function. In contrast, RNAi-mediated suppression of either Opa1 or mitofusin/MARF induced cardiac dysfunction associated with mitochondrial depolarization and ROS production. Inhibiting ROS by overexpressing superoxide dismutase (SOD) or suppressing ROMO1 prevented mitochondrial and heart tube dysfunction provoked by Opa1 RNAi, but not by mitofusin/MARF RNAi. In contrast, enhancing the ability of endoplasmic/sarcoplasmic reticulum to handle stress by expressing Xbp1 rescued the cardiomyopathy of mitofusin/MARF insufficiency without improving that caused by Opa1 deficiency. We conclude that decreased mitochondrial size is not inherently detrimental to cardiomyocytes. Rather, preservation of mitochondrial function by Opa1 located on the inner mitochondrial membrane, and prevention of ER stress by mitofusin/MARF located on the outer mitochondrial membrane, are central functions of these ""mitochondrial fusion proteins"".",2015,"Poonam Bhandari, Moshi Song, Gerald W Dorn 2nd"
Local and systemic effects of targeted zinc redistribution in Drosophila neuronal and gastrointestinal tissues,26411574,10.1007/s10534-015-9881-5,"While the effects of systemic zinc ion deficiency and toxicity on animal health are well documented, the impacts of localized, tissue-specific disturbances in zinc homeostasis are less well understood. Previously we have identified zinc dyshomeostasis scenarios caused by the targeted manipulation of zinc transport genes in the Drosophila eye. Over expression of the uptake transporter dZIP42C.1 (dZIP1) combined with knockdown of the efflux transporter dZNT63C (dZNT1) causes a zinc toxicity phenotype, as does over expression of dZIP71B or dZNT86D. However, all three genotypes result in different morphologies, responses to dietary zinc, and genetic interactions with the remaining zinc transport genes, indicating that each causes a different redistribution of zinc within affected cells. dZNT86D (eGFP) over expression generates a completely different phenotype, interpreted as a Golgi zinc deficiency. Here we assess the effect of each of these transgenes when targeted to a range of Drosophila tissues. We find that dZIP71B is a particularly potent zinc uptake gene, causing early developmental lethality when targeted to multiple different tissue types. dZNT86D over expression (Golgi-only zinc toxicity) is less deleterious, but causes highly penetrant adult cuticle, sensory bristle and wing expansion defects. The dZIP42C.1 over expression, dZNT63C knockdown combination causes only moderate adult cuticle defects and sensitivity to dietary zinc when expressed in the midgut. The Golgi-only zinc deficiency caused by dZNT86D (eGFP) expression results in mild cuticle defects, highly penetrant wing expansion defects and developmental lethality when targeted to the central nervous system and, uniquely, the fat bodies.",2015,"Christopher D Richards, Richard Burke"

The FGLamide-allatostatins influence foraging behavior in Drosophila melanogaster,22558326,10.1371/journal.pone.0036059,"Allatostatins (ASTs) are multifunctional neuropeptides that generally act in an inhibitory fashion. ASTs were identified as inhibitors of juvenile hormone biosynthesis. Juvenile hormone regulates insect metamorphosis, reproduction, food intake, growth, and development. Drosophila melanogaster RNAi lines of PheGlyLeu-amide-ASTs (FGLa/ASTs) and their cognate receptor, Dar-1, were used to characterize roles these neuropeptides and their respective receptor may play in behavior and physiology. Dar-1 and FGLa/AST RNAi lines showed a significant reduction in larval foraging in the presence of food. The larval foraging defect is not observed in the absence of food. These RNAi lines have decreased for transcript levels which encodes cGMP- dependent protein kinase. A reduction in the for transcript is known to be associated with a naturally occurring allelic variation that creates a sitter phenotype in contrast to the rover phenotype which is caused by a for allele associated with increased for activity. The sitting phenotype of FGLa/AST and Dar-1 RNAi lines is similar to the phenotype of a deletion mutant of an AST/galanin-like receptor (NPR-9) in Caenorhabditis elegans. Associated with the foraging defect in C. elegans npr-9 mutants is accumulation of intestinal lipid. Lipid accumulation was not a phenotype associated with the FGLa/AST and Dar-1 RNAi lines.",2012,"Christine Wang, Ian Chin-Sang, William G Bendena"
Functional association between eyegone and HP1a mediates wingless transcriptional repression during development,22547675,10.1128/MCB.06311-11,"The eyegone (eyg) gene encodes Eyg, a transcription factor of the Pax family with multiple roles during Drosophila development. Although Eyg has been shown to act as a repressor, nothing is known about the mechanism by which it represses its target genes. Here, we show that Eyg forms a protein complex with heterochromatin protein 1a (HP1a). Both proteins bind to the same chromatin regions on polytene chromosomes and act cooperatively to suppress variegation and mediate gene silencing. In addition, Eyg binds to a wingless (wg) enhancer region, recruiting HP1a to assemble a closed, heterochromatin-like conformation that represses transcription of the wg gene. We describe here the evidence that suggests that Eyg, encoded by eyegone (eyg), represses wingless (wg) during eye development by association with HP1a. We show that Eyg forms a protein complex with HP1a and both proteins colocalize on salivary gland polytene chromosomes. Using position effect variegation (PEV) experiments, we demonstrated that eyg has a dose-dependent effect on heterochromatin gene silencing and identified a genetic interaction with HP1a in this process. We further demonstrated that HP1a binds to the same wg enhancer element as Eyg. DNase I sensitivity assays indicated that this enhancer region has a closed heterochromatin-like conformation, which becomes open in eyg mutants. In these mutants, much less HP1a binds to the wg enhancer region, as shown by ChIP experiments. Furthermore, as previously described for Eyg, a reduction in the amount of HP1a in the eye imaginal disc derepresses wg. Together, our results suggest a model in which Eyg specifically binds to the wg enhancer region, recruiting HP1a to that site. The recruitment of HP1a prevents transcription by favoring a closed, heterochromatin-like structure. Thus, for the first time, we show that HP1a plays a direct role in the repression of a developmentally regulated gene, wg, during Drosophila eye development.",2012,"Natalia Azpiazu, Lara Salvany, David Requena"
The novel long non-coding RNA CRG regulates Drosophila locomotor behavior,23074190,10.1093/nar/gks943,"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that have no protein-coding capacity make up a large proportion of the transcriptome of various species. Many lncRNAs are expressed within the animal central nervous system in spatial- and temporal-specific patterns, indicating that lncRNAs play important roles in cellular processes, neural development, and even in cognitive and behavioral processes. However, relatively little is known about their in vivo functions and underlying molecular mechanisms in the nervous system. Here, we report a neural-specific Drosophila lncRNA, CASK regulatory gene (CRG), which participates in locomotor activity and climbing ability by positively regulating its neighboring gene CASK (Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase). CRG deficiency led to reduced locomotor activity and a defective climbing ability-phenotypes that are often seen in CASK mutant. CRG mutant also showed reduced CASK expression level while CASK over-expression could rescue the CRG mutant phenotypes in reciprocal. At the molecular level, CRG was required for the recruitment of RNA polymerase II to the CASK promoter regions, which in turn enhanced CASK expression. Our work has revealed new functional roles of lncRNAs and has provided insights to explore the pathogenesis of neurological diseases associated with movement disorders.",2012,"Xiaojun Liu, Runsheng Chen, Shengyun Wen, Zhefeng Gong, Li Liu, Meixia Li, Yanqiong Zhou, Xiangqian Guo, Xiaowei Chen, Baoyan Bai, Yijin Wang"
Genome-wide studies of the multi-zinc finger Drosophila Suppressor of Hairy-wing protein in the ovary,22406832,10.1093/nar/gks225,"The Drosophila Suppressor of Hairy-wing [Su(Hw)] protein is a globally expressed, multi-zinc finger (ZnF) DNA-binding protein. Su(Hw) forms a classic insulator when bound to the gypsy retrotransposon and is essential for female germline development. These functions are genetically separable, as exemplified by Su(Hw)(f) that carries a defective ZnF10, causing a loss of insulator but not germline function. Here, we completed the first genome-wide analysis of Su(Hw)-binding sites (SBSs) in the ovary, showing that tissue-specific binding is not responsible for the restricted developmental requirements for Su(Hw). Mapping of ovary Su(Hw)(f) SBSs revealed that female fertility requires binding to only one third of the wild-type sites. We demonstrate that Su(Hw)(f) retention correlates with binding site affinity and partnership with Modifier of (mdg4) 67.2 protein. Finally, we identify clusters of co-regulated ovary genes flanked by Su(Hw)(f) bound sites and show that loss of Su(Hw) has limited effects on transcription of these genes. These data imply that the fertility function of Su(Hw) may not depend upon the demarcation of transcriptional domains. Our studies establish a framework for understanding the germline Su(Hw) function and provide insights into how chromatin occupancy is achieved by multi-ZnF proteins, the most common transcription factor class in metazoans.",2012,"Craig M Hart, Alexey A Soshnev, Kai Tan, Bing He, Ryan M Baxley, Nan Jiang, Pamela K Geyer"
Drosophila melanogaster sex peptide stimulates juvenile hormone synthesis and depresses sex pheromone production in Helicoverpa armigera,12770380,10.1016/s0022-1910(98)00106-1,"Previous studies demonstrate that virgin female adult Helicoverpa armigera (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) moths exhibit calling behaviour and produce sex pheromone in scotophase from the day after emergence, and that mating turns off both of these pre-mating activities. In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, a product of the male accessory glands, termed sex peptide (SP), has been identified as being responsible for suppressing female receptivity after transfer to the female genital tract during mating. Juvenile hormone (JH) production is activated in the D. melanogaster corpus allatum (CA) by SP in vitro. We herein demonstrate cross-reactivity of D. melanogaster SP in the H. armigera moth: JH production in photophase virgin female moth CA in vitro is directly activated in a dose-dependent manner by synthetic D. melanogaster SP, and concurrently inhibits pheromone biosynthesis activating neuropeptide (PBAN)-activated pheromone production by isolated pheromone glands of virgin females. Control peptides (locust adipokinetic hormone, AKH-I, and human corticotropin, ACTH) do not inhibit in vitro pheromone biosynthesis. Moreover, SP injected into virgin H. armigera females, decapitated 24 h after eclosion, or into scotophase virgin females, suppresses pheromone production. In the light of these results, we hypothesize the presumptive existence of a SP-like factor among the peptides transmitted to female H. armigera during copulation, inducing an increased level of JH production and depressing the levels of pheromone produced thereafter.",1999,"E Kubli, S W.

Distinct caspases were activated by these Dapaf-1 isoforms. Loss of Dapaf-1 function resulted in defective cytochrome c-dependent caspase activities and reduced apoptosis in embryo and in larval brain. Dapaf-1 activities were also involved in cell death induced by ectopic expression of reaper in the compound eye. These data suggest that Dapaf-1/cytochrome c-dependent cell death-inducing machinery is present in Drosophila, and the requirement of Dapaf-1/Apaf-1 in neural cell death is conserved through evolution.",1999,"K Matsuno, H Kanuka, N Inohara, K Sawamoto, M Miura, H Okano"

Dicer-2-Dependent Generation of Viral DNA from Defective Genomes of RNA Viruses Modulates Antiviral Immunity in Insects,29503180,10.1016/j.chom.2018.02.001,"The RNAi pathway confers antiviral immunity in insects. Virus-specific siRNA responses are amplified via the reverse transcription of viral RNA to viral DNA (vDNA). The nature, biogenesis, and regulation of vDNA are unclear. We find that vDNA produced during RNA virus infection of Drosophila and mosquitoes is present in both linear and circular forms. Circular vDNA (cvDNA) is sufficient to produce siRNAs that confer partially protective immunity when challenged with a cognate virus. cvDNAs bear homology to defective viral genomes (DVGs), and DVGs serve as templates for vDNA and cvDNA synthesis. Accordingly, DVGs promote the amplification of vDNA-mediated antiviral RNAi responses in infected Drosophila. Furthermore, vDNA synthesis is regulated by the DExD/H helicase domain of Dicer-2 in a mechanism distinct from its role in siRNA generation.

Cell Aggregation Assays to Evaluate the Binding of the Drosophila Notch with Trans-Ligands and its Inhibition by Cis-Ligands,29364239,10.3791/56919,"Notch signaling is an evolutionarily conserved cell-cell communication system used broadly in animal development and adult maintenance. Interaction of the Notch receptor with ligands from neighboring cells induces activation of the signaling pathway (trans-activation), while interaction with ligands from the same cell inhibits signaling (cis-inhibition). Proper balance between trans-activation and cis-inhibition helps establish optimal levels of Notch signaling in some contexts during animal development. Because of the overlapping expression domains of Notch and its ligands in many cell types and the existence of feedback mechanisms, studying the effects of a given post-translational modification on trans- versus cis-interactions of Notch and its ligands in vivo is difficult. Here, we describe a protocol for using Drosophila S2 cells in cell-aggregation assays to assess the effects of knocking down a Notch pathway modifier on the binding of Notch to each ligand in trans and in cis. S2 cells stably or transiently transfected with a Notch-expressing vector are mixed with cells expressing each Notch ligand (S2-Delta or S2-Serrate). Trans-binding between the receptor and ligands results in the formation of heterotypic cell aggregates and is measured in terms of the number of aggregates per mL composed of >6 cells. To examine the inhibitory effect of cis-ligands, S2 cells co-expressing Notch and each ligand are mixed with S2-Delta or S2-Serrate cells and the number of aggregates is quantified as described above. The relative decrease in the number of aggregates due to the presence of cis-ligands provides a measure of cis-ligand-mediated inhibition of trans-binding. These straightforward assays can provide semi-quantitative data on the effects of genetic or pharmacological manipulations on the binding of Notch to its ligands, and can help deciphering the molecular mechanisms underlying the in vivo effects of such manipulations on Notch signaling.",2018,"Hamed Jafar-Nejad, Ashutosh Pandey"
slit: an EGF-homologous locus of D. melanogaster involved in the development of the embryonic central nervous system,3144436,10.1016/0092-8674(88)90249-8,"A family of loci homologous to the EGF-like portion of Notch, a gene involved in neurogenesis, have been identified in D. melanogaster.

In situ hybridization and antibody staining of embryos show initial localization in cells along the midline of the neuroepithelium. High level expression is restricted in the developing embryo to a subset of six midline glial cells abutting growing axons. Extracellular localization is suggested by the presence of EGF-like repeats in the deduced protein sequence and antibody staining.

Cellular and developmental distribution of human homologues of the Drosophilia rdgB protein in the rat retina,12037004,,"Purpose: The Nirs (Nir1, Nir2, and Nir3), human homologues of Drosophila retinal degeneration B (rdgB), have been considered candidate genes for human inherited retinal degeneration diseases. To gain a better understanding of their functions in the retina and their putative roles in retinal degeneration diseases, this study was undertaken to determine their distribution profile in developing and mature rat retinas. Methods: Specific antibodies against each of the Nir proteins were raised in rabbits and used in indirect immunofluorescence analysis to determine the distribution profile of the three proteins. Eyes from Wistar rats at various developmental stages (embryonic day [E]18 to postnatal day [P]16) were sectioned vertically and immunostained with anti-Nir antibodies. Coimmunostaining for Nirs and several specific cellular and subcellular markers was used to determine precisely the cellular and subcellular distribution of the Nirs. Sections were observed under a confocal laser microscope, and image analysis was performed with the standard operating software provided with the microscope. Results: Confocal microscopic analysis of Nir1 immunoreactivity revealed that it was predominantly expressed in premature Müller cells at birth and that it was upregulated during Müller cell maturation. In contrast, Nir2 and Nir3 were homogeneously distributed in undifferentiated neuroblasts and ganglion cells at birth and later became distinctly distributed in newly differentiated neuronal cells. From P4, Nir2 and Nir3 were highly expressed in neuronal cells and their processes, coinciding with the formation of synaptic layers and ongoing synaptogenesis. From P12, Nir2 was uniformly expressed in all classes of retinal neuronal cells, including ganglion cells, horizontal cells, amacrine cells, bipolar cells, and photoreceptor cells. In the adult rat retina, Nir2 was preferentially localized to the somata of all classes of retinal neurons, whereas Nir3 was highly expressed in the synaptic terminals. This specific localization of Nir3 was confirmed by double immunostaining with the presynaptic protein synaptosomal-associated protein (SNAP)-25. In photoreceptor cells, both Nir2 and Nir3 were found to be highly expressed in the inner segments but were not detectably expressed in the outer segments. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the three Nir proteins are highly expressed in the developing retina, each exhibiting a distinct distribution profile. The different distribution patterns of these closely related proteins during development and at maturity may reflect their different cellular functions in vivo and their different roles in retinal cell survival or degeneration.",2002,"Sima Lev, Donghua Tian"

Homology analysis shows that the hUNC93B1 gene is highly conserved and related to sequences in Arabidopsis thaliana, C. elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, chicken and mouse. Structural analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of hUNC93B1 points to possible existence of multiple membrane-spanning domains. hUNC93B1 protein also displays some similarities to the bacterial ABC-2 type transporter signature and to ion transporters of Deinococcus radiodurans and Helicobacter pylori. As revealed by Northern analysis, the level of expression varies significantly between tissues, with the highest level detected in the heart. The gene was mapped to chromosomal band 11q13 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

"Molecular basis of amplification in Drosophila phototransduction: roles for G protein, phospholipase C, and diacylglycerol kinase",12441057,10.1016/s0896-6273(02)01048-6,"In Drosophila photoreceptors, the amplification responsible for generating quantum bumps in response to photoisomerization of single rhodopsin molecules has been thought to be mediated downstream of phospholipase C (PLC), since bump amplitudes were reportedly unaffected in mutants with greatly reduced levels of either G protein or PLC. We now find that quantum bumps in such mutants are reduced approximately 3- to 5-fold but are restored to near wild-type values by mutations in the rdgA gene encoding diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) and also by depleting intracellular ATP. The results demonstrate that amplification requires activation of multiple G protein and PLC molecules, identify DGK as a key enzyme regulating amplification, and implicate diacylglycerol as a messenger of excitation in Drosophila phototransduction.",2002,"P Raghu, F Martin, R C Hardie, P Georgiev, G W Cochrane, M Juusola"
Expression of six mitochondrial genes during Drosophila oogenesis: analysis by in situ hybridization,1699640,10.1016/0922-3371(90)90017-q,"We have done a comparative analysis of RNA from six mitochondrial genes (rDNA, ND2, COI, COIII, ND4-ND5, Cyt b) during Drosophila oogenesis, using in situ hybridization. This study showed the same variation for each of these transcripts, which is similar to that obtained with the total mitochondrial RNA (Tourmente et al. (1990) Biol. Cell 60, 119-127). A constant RNA density until stage 9, followed by a rapid decline, was observed in follicle and nurse cells. These results confirm those previously obtained (Tourmente et al., (1990) Biol. Cell 60, 119-127), in favor of the existence of a correlation between the mtRNA level and the cell volume and/or the nuclear DNA content, and suggest a global extra-mitochondrial, transcriptional control mechanism. We also show that the relative proportions of the different RNA are similar, whatever the stage and cell type examined, even though the total mtRNA quantity is different. They are comparable to those previously obtained by Northern analysis of Drosophila embryos (Berthier et al. (1986) Nucleic Acids Res. 14, 1400-1412, suggesting a posttranscriptional control independent of the cell type. Surprisingly, we have detected an extra-mitochondrial hybridization for COIII, both in light and electron microscopy.

Drosophila melanogaster acylphosphatase: a common ancestor for acylphosphatase isoenzymes of vertebrate species,9744795,10.1016/s0014-5793(98)00912-0,"An open reading frame encoding a putative acylphosphatase was found in Drosophila melanogaster. The corresponding gene product shows 40% identity and 22 additional amino acid residues at the C-terminus as compared to muscle- and common-type human acylphosphatases. Moreover, all the residues involved in the catalytic mechanism of vertebrate enzymes are conserved in the D. melanogaster acylphosphatase. The D. melanogaster protein and a deletion mutant, similar in length to vertebrate acylphosphatases, were produced by cloning the corresponding cDNA in Escherichia coli. The wild-type enzyme is a protein with a well-established three-dimensional fold and a markedly reduced conformational stability as compared to vertebrate isoenzymes. The specific activity of the enzyme is significantly lower than that found in vertebrate enzymes though the substrate binding capability is basically unaltered. The deletion of 22 residues does not cause a significant change in k(cat), while affecting the apparent binding parameters. This work suggests that the genes encoding the vertebrate enzymes originate from an ancestor gene by duplication and subsequent evolution.",1998,"G Ramponi, M P Bozzetti, G Liguri, F Magherini, C Cecchi, G Raugei, A Pieri, N Taddei"
High production of nondisjunction mutants in the offspring of Drosophila melanogaster females exposed to carbon dioxide at meiosis I,9544196,,"Drosophila melanogaster females homozygous for X-linked recessive markers, y and wi, were exposed to CO2 and mated with y+ w+/Y males. The progeny were sampled and inspected for y wi/y wi/Y (XXY) and y+ w+/O (XO) mutants. The frequency of nondisjunction XXY mutants after a 90-min exposure to CO2 increased 100-fold above the control level in the first-day brood but did not increase above the control level in the second to sixth broods, showing that CO2 is an extremely potent inducer of nondisjunction in mature oocytes during meiotic metaphase I but is not harmful to immature oocytes. Nondisjunction-causing damage induced by CO2 in mature oocytes disappeared completely within one day after CO2 treatment, as evidenced by a reduction of the number of XXY mutants to the control level when the mating of CO2-treated females was delayed by one day. CO2-induced nondisjunction is probably due to damage to spindle microtubules in mature oocytes at metaphase I. N2 is a less potent inducer of nondisjunction than CO2. Maternal X-irradiation with 4 Gy did not induce XXY mutants, showing that medium-level radiation does not induce nondisjunction. The results support Gaulden's hypothesis that oxygen deficits and CO2 increases in the microenvironment of mature oocytes can be potent inducers of nondisjunction.

The Drosophila clathrin heavy chain gene: clathrin function is essential in a multicellular organism,8375651,,"The clathrin heavy chain (HC) is the major structural polypeptide of the cytoplasmic surface lattice of clathrin-coated pits and vesicles. As a genetic approach to understanding the role of clathrin in cellular morphogenesis and developmental signal transduction, a clathrin heavy chain (Chc) gene of Drosophila melanogaster has been identified by a combination of molecular and classical genetic approaches. Using degenerate primers based on mammalian and yeast clathrin HC sequences, a small fragment of the HC gene was amplified from genomic Drosophila DNA by the polymerase chain reaction. Genomic and cDNA clones from phage libraries were isolated and analyzed using this fragment as a probe. The amino acid sequence of the Drosophila clathrin HC deduced from cDNA sequences is 80%, 57% and 49% identical, respectively, with the mammalian, Dictyostelium and yeast HCs. Hybridization in situ to larval polytene chromosomes revealed a single Chc locus at position 13F2 on the X chromosome. A 13-kb genomic Drosophila fragment including the Chc transcription unit was reintroduced into the Drosophila genome via P element-mediated germline transformation. This DNA complemented a group of EMS-induced lethal mutations mapping to the same region of the X chromosome, thus identifying the Chc complementation group. Mutant individuals homozygous or hemizygous for the Chc1, Chc2 or Chc3 alleles developed to a late stage of embryogenesis, but failed to hatch to the first larval stage. A fourth allele, Chc4, exhibited polyphasic lethality, with a significant number of homozygous and hemizygous offspring surviving to adulthood. Germline clonal analysis of Chc mutant alleles indicated that the three tight lethal alleles were autonomous cell-lethal mutations in the female germline. In contrast, Chc4 germline clones were viable at a rate comparable to wild type, giving rise to viable adult progeny. However, hemizygous Chc4 males were invariably sterile. The sterility was efficiently rescued by an autosomal copy of the wild-type Chc gene reintroduced on a P element. These findings suggest a specialized role for clathrin in spermatogenesis.",1993,"M Morgan, C Bazinet, A L Katzen, A P Mahowald, S K Lemmon"
The polyhomeotic locus of Drosophila melanogaster is transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally regulated during embryogenesis,9376325,10.1016/s0925-4773(97)00091-9,"The polyhomeotic (ph) locus of Drosophila is a complex locus essential for the maintenance of segmental identity. Genetic analysis suggested that two independent units contribute to ph function. Comparison of genomic sequence shows that the ph locus has been duplicated, and that it contains proximal and distal transcription units. The proximal transcription unit encodes two embryonic mRNAs of 6.4 and 6.1 kb, and the distal unit encodes a 6.4-kb embryonic mRNA. The proximal and distal transcription units are differentially regulated at the mRNA level during development as shown by developmental Northern analysis. The distal protein is very similar to the proximal product, except for the absence of an amino terminal region, and a small region near the carboxy terminus. The long open reading frame in the distal cDNA does not begin with an ATG codon, and an internal ATG is used for a start codon. We show that the proximal protein occurs in two forms that are developmentally regulated, and that probably arise from use of two different initiator methionine codons. We find no evidence for differential binding of proximal and distal products to polytene chromosomes. Nevertheless, we show that mutations in the proximal and distal proteins have differing effects on regulation of a reporter under the control of a regulatory region from bithoraxoid, suggesting that ph proximal and distal proteins have different functions. These results show that the ph locus undergoes complex developmental regulation, and suggest that Polycomb group regulation may be more dynamic than anticipated.",1997,"H W Brock, N B Randsholt, D A Sinclair, M Kyba, N N Cheng, J W Hodgson"
Characterization of natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster with regard to the hobo system: a new hypothesis on the invasion,9290322,10.1017/s0016672397002826,"Until now, with regard to the hobo system of hybrid dysgenesis, natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster have been investigated using only two criteria: at the molecular level, the presence or absence of XhoI fragments 2.6 kb long or smaller; and/or at the genetic level, the ability to induce gonadal dysgenesis sterility in crosses A (females of an E reference strain crossed with males under test) and A* (females under test crossed with males of an H reference strain). Recently, analyses of laboratory strains using these criteria as well as the mobilization of two reporter genes, the male recombination and the number of 'TPE' repeats in the S region, revealed a lack of correlation between the different dysgenic parameters themselves, and also between these parameters and the molecular characteristics of the strains. Thirteen current strains derived from world populations were therefore investigated with regard to all these dysgenic traits, to determine discriminating criteria providing a robust method of classifying natural populations and deducing the dynamics of hobo elements in these populations. We show, as in laboratory strains, a lack of correlation between the parameters studied. Therefore, the significance of each of them as well as the nature of hobo hybrid dysgenesis are discussed, to propose an analysis method of the hobo system applicable to natural populations. According to the geographical distribution of hobo activities in world populations and to the variable polymorphism of the number of 'TPE' repeats, we propose a new scenario for the invasion of D. melanogaster by hobo elements.",1997,"C Bazin, D Higuet, E Bonnivard"

Substantial rescue of normal photoreceptor structure and physiology is effected by rhodopsin expression during the time of the normal onset of rhodopsin synthesis. Expression shortly before or after this critical period does not rescue these deficits.

Crucial role of zebrafish prox1 in hypothalamic catecholaminergic neurons development,18331627,10.1186/1471-213X-8-27,"Background: Prox1, the vertebrate homolog of prospero in Drosophila melanogaster, is a divergent homeogene that regulates cell proliferation, fate determination and differentiation during vertebrate embryonic development.

Specifically, we evidenced prox1 expression in a group of neurons, already positive for otp1, located in the hypothalamus at the level of the posterior tuberculum (PT). Prox1 knock-down determines the severe loss of hypothalamic catecholaminergic (CA) neurons, identified by tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression, and the synergistic prox1/otp1 overexpression induces the appearance of hypothalamic supernumerary TH-positive neurons and ectopic TH-positive cells on the yolk epitelium.

Light-dependent modulation of Shab channels via phosphoinositide depletion in Drosophila photoreceptors,18760696,10.1016/j.neuron.2008.07.009,"The Drosophila phototransduction cascade transforms light into depolarizations that are further shaped by activation of voltage-dependent K+ (Kv) channels. In whole-cell recordings of isolated photoreceptors, we show that light selectively modulated the delayed rectifier (Shab) current. Shab currents were increased by light with similar kinetics to the light-induced current itself (latency approximately 20 ms), recovering to control values with a t(1/2) of approximately 60 s in darkness. Genetic disruption of PLCbeta4, responsible for light-induced PIP(2) hydrolysis, abolished this light-dependent modulation. In mutants of CDP-diaclyglycerol synthase (cds(1)), required for PIP(2) resynthesis, the modulation became irreversible, but exogenously applied PIP(2) restored reversibility. The modulation was accurately and reversibly mimicked by application of PIP(2) to heterologously expressed Shab channels in excised inside-out patches. The results indicate a functionally implemented mechanism of Kv channel modulation by PIP(2) in photoreceptors, which enables light-dependent regulation of signal processing by direct coupling to the phototransduction cascade.",2008,"Jiehong Huang, Roger C Hardie, Che-Hsiung Liu, Matti Weckström, Stephan Krause, Yani Krause"

[Distant interactions between enhancers and promoters in Drosophila melanogaster are mediated by transgene-flanking Su(Hw) insulators],21954612,,"Insulators are DNA elements modulating gene activation by enhancers. Interaction between insulators can result in either isolation, or activation of promoter by the enhancer. In the present study, it is demonstrated that in transgenic lines, the yellow enhancers are unable to activate promoter of the tagged gene through the mini-white gene. The mini-white promoter, which functions as an insulator, can block the enhancer activity. In case that the genes and regulatory elements in the construct are flanked by Su(Hw) insulators from retroposon MDG4, interaction between enhancers and the yellow promoter is restored. The data obtained are congruent with the model suggesting that promoters can function as insulators, and that interaction between the insulators facilitates the interaction between enhancers and promoters within transcriptional domain.",2011,"D A Chetverina, M M Erokhin, A I Davydova, P G Georgiev"
Tramtrack is genetically upstream of genes controlling tracheal tube size in Drosophila,22216153,10.1371/journal.pone.0028985,"The Drosophila transcription factor Tramtrack (Ttk) is involved in a wide range of developmental decisions, ranging from early embryonic patterning to differentiation processes in organogenesis. Given the wide spectrum of functions and pleiotropic effects that hinder a comprehensive characterisation, many of the tissue specific functions of this transcription factor are only poorly understood. We recently discovered multiple roles of Ttk in the development of the tracheal system on the morphogenetic level. Here, we sought to identify some of the underlying genetic components that are responsible for the tracheal phenotypes of Ttk mutants. We therefore profiled gene expression changes after Ttk loss- and gain-of-function in whole embryos and cell populations enriched for tracheal cells. The analysis of the transcriptomes revealed widespread changes in gene expression. Interestingly, one of the most prominent gene classes that showed significant opposing responses to loss- and gain-of-function was annotated with functions in chitin metabolism, along with additional genes that are linked to cellular responses, which are impaired in ttk mutants. The expression changes of these genes were validated by quantitative real-time PCR and further functional analysis of these candidate genes and other genes also expected to control tracheal tube size revealed at least a partial explanation of Ttk's role in tube size regulation. The computational analysis of our tissue-specific gene expression data highlighted the sensitivity of the approach and revealed an interesting set of novel putatively tracheal genes.",2011,"Boris Adryan, David Molnar, Barbara Rotstein, Marta Llimargas"
The sterile 20-like kinase Tao-1 controls tissue growth by regulating the Salvador-Warts-Hippo pathway,22075148,10.1016/j.devcel.2011.09.012,"The Salvador-Warts-Hippo (SWH) pathway is a complex signaling network that controls both developmental and regenerative tissue growth.

Tao-1 controls various biological phenomena, including microtubule dynamics, animal behavior, and brain development. Here we describe a role for Tao-1 as a regulator of epithelial tissue growth that modulates activity of the core SWH pathway kinase cassette. Tao-1 functions together with Hippo to activate Warts-mediated repression of Yorkie. Tao-1's ability to control SWH pathway activity is evolutionarily conserved because human TAO1 can suppress activity of the Yorkie ortholog, YAP. Human TAO1 controls SWH pathway activity by phosphorylating, and activating, the Hippo ortholog, MST2. Given that SWH pathway activity is subverted in many human cancers, our findings identify human TAO kinases as potential tumor suppressor genes.",2011,"Carole L C Poon, Jane I Lin, Xiaomeng Zhang, Kieran F Harvey"
A model of oxidative stress management: moderation of carbohydrate metabolizing enzymes in SOD1-null Drosophila melanogaster,21909438,10.1371/journal.pone.0024518,"The response to oxidative stress involves numerous genes and mutations in these genes often manifest in pleiotropic ways that presumably reflect perturbations in ROS-mediated physiology. The Drosophila melanogaster SOD1-null allele (cSODn108) is proposed to result in oxidative stress by preventing superoxide breakdown. In SOD1-null flies, oxidative stress management is thought to be reliant on the glutathione-dependent antioxidants that utilize NADPH to cycle between reduced and oxidized form. Previous studies suggest that SOD1-null Drosophila rely on lipid catabolism for energy rather than carbohydrate metabolism. We tested these connections by comparing the activity of carbohydrate metabolizing enzymes, lipid and triglyceride concentration, and steady state NADPH:NADP(+) in SOD1-null and control transgenic rescue flies. We find a negative shift in the activity of carbohydrate metabolizing enzymes in SOD1-nulls and the NADP(+)-reducing enzymes were found to have significantly lower activity than the other enzymes assayed. Little evidence for the catabolism of lipids as preferential energy source was found, as the concentration of lipids and triglycerides were not significantly lower in SOD1-nulls compared with controls. Using a starvation assay to impact lipids and triglycerides, we found that lipids were indeed depleted in both genotypes when under starvation stress, suggesting that oxidative damage was not preventing the catabolism of lipids in SOD1-null flies. Remarkably, SOD1-nulls were also found to be relatively resistant to starvation. Age profiles of enzyme activity, triglyceride and lipid concentration indicates that the trends observed are consistent over the average lifespan of the SOD1-nulls. Based on our results, we propose a model of physiological response in which organisms under oxidative stress limit the production of ROS through the down-regulation of carbohydrate metabolism in order to moderate the products exiting the electron transport chain.",2011,"Kristine E Bernard, Tony L Parkes, Thomas J S Merritt"
Two modes of balancing selection in Drosophila melanogaster: overcompensation and overdominance,1906418,,"Overdominance is often invoked to account for the extensive polymorphisms found in natural populations of organisms; overcompensation, however, may be equally or more important. Overcompensation occurs when limiting resources are better exploited by a genetically mixed than by a uniform population, and is often causally related to frequency-dependent selection. We have designed experiments to test whether overcompensation occurs in Drosophila melanogaster, using the Sod locus as a marker. Tests are made at each of two densities and two temperatures for cultures with desired genetic compositions. Both temperature and density have statistically significant effects on the per-female productivity of the cultures. More important, there are strong effects due to overcompensation. Cultures that are more polymorphic are also more productive than less polymorphic ones even when the level of individual heterozygosity is the same in all. There is also overdominance for the Sod locus: the heterozygotes are more productive than either homozygote at every temperature and density, and the differences are statistically significant in several cases. These results corroborate previous studies showing that overdominance may contribute to the maintenance of the Sod polymorphisms. Moreover, our results indicate that the significance of overcompensation as a mechanism to account for polymorphism in natural populations deserves further investigation.",1991,"F J Ayala, A Moya, T X Peng"
Homologous patterns in the embryonic development of the peripheral nervous system in the grasshopper Schistocerca gregaria and the fly Drosophila melanogaster,1769332,,"To determine the generality of developmental mechanisms involved in the construction of the insect nervous system, the embryonic development of the peripheral nervous system in the grasshopper Schistocerca gregaria was characterized at the level of identified neurons and nerve branches and then compared to that previously described from the fly Drosophila melanogaster. For this, immunocytochemistry using a neuron-specific antibody was carried out on staged grasshopper embryos. Our results show that initially a simple peripheral nerve scaffolding is established in each segment of the animal. This scaffolding consists of a pair of intersegmental nerves that are formed by identified afferent and efferent pioneer neurons and a pair of segmental nerves that are formed by afferent pioneers situated in limb buds. Subsequently, identified sets of sensory neurons differentiate in a stereotyped spatiotemporal pattern in dorsal, lateral and ventral clusters in each segment and project their axons onto these nerves. Although segment-specific differences exist, serial homologs of the developing nerves and sensory neurons can be identified. A comparison of these results with those obtained from Drosophila shows that virtually the same pattern of peripheral nerves and sensory structures is formed in both species. This indicates that the construction of the peripheral nervous system in extremely divergent modern insects relies on conserved developmental mechanisms that evolved in ancestral insects over 300 million years ago.",1991,"F Chabaud, T Meier, H Reichert"

Here we show that lgd is required in all imaginal disc cells to suppress the activity of the Notch pathway. lgd encodes a member of a poorly characterized protein family present in all animals, which includes a member that is involved in an inheritable form of mental retardation in humans. Our analysis reveals that Lgd is required for endosomal trafficking of Notch and other proteins.

In NC chromosomes, the SU(VAR)3-9 protein was found in pericentric heterochromatin and at 223 sites on euchromatic arms, while in SG chromosomes, it was mainly restricted to the chromocenter. In NC chromosomes, the HP1 and SUUR proteins bind to 331 and 256 sites, respectively, which are almost twice the number of sites in SG chromosomes. The distribution of the HP1 and SU(VAR)3-9 proteins depends on the SuUR gene. A mutation in this gene results in a dramatic decrease in the amount of SU(VAR)3-9 binding sites in autosomes. In the X chromosome, these sites are relocated in comparison to the SuUR (+), and their total number only varies slightly. HP1 binding sites are redistributed in chromosomes of SuUR mutants, and their overall number did not change as considerably as SU(VAR)3-9.

It has long been speculated that a multiple oscillator circadian network in animals underlies the behavioral and physiological pattern variability caused by seasonal fluctuations of photoperiod. We have manipulated separately the circadian photoentrainment pathway within E- and M-cells and show that E-cells process light information and function as master clocks in the presence of light. M-cells in contrast need darkness to cycle autonomously and dominate the network. The results indicate that the network switches control between these two centers as a function of photoperiod. Together with the different entraining properties of the two clock centers, the results suggest that the functional organization of the network underlies the behavioral adjustment to variations in daylength and season.",2007,"M Fernanda Ceriani, Dan Stoleru, Michael Rosbash, Jerome S Menet, María de la Paz Fernández, Pipat Nawathean"

While the WD-repeat protein encoding gene NOTCHLESS has been involved in the regulation of the Notch signaling pathway in Drosophila, its yeast homolog Rsa4p was shown to participate in 60S ribosomal subunit biogenesis. The plant homolog ScNLE was previously characterized in Solanum chacoense (ScNLE) as being involved in seed development. However, expression data and reduced size of ScNLE underexpressing plants suggested in addition a role during shoot development. We here report the detailed phenotypic characterization of ScNLE underexpressing plants during shoot development. ScNLE was shown to be expressed in actively dividing cells of the shoot apex. Consistent with this, ScNLE underexpression caused pleiotropic defects such as a reduction in aerial organ size, a reduction in some organ numbers, delayed flowering, and an increase in stomatal index. Analysis of adaxial epidermal cells revealed that both cell number and cell size were reduced in mature leaves of ScNLE underexpressing lines. Two-hybrid screens with the Nle domain and the WD-repeat domain of ScNLE allowed the isolation of homologs of yeast MIDASIN and NSA2 genes, the products of which are involved in 60S ribosomal subunit biogenesis in yeast. A ScNLE-GFP chimeric protein was localized in both the cytoplasm and nucleus.

We show that Btn2 is an ortholog of the Drosophila and mammalian Hook1 proteins that interact with SNAREs, cargo proteins, and coat components involved in endosome-Golgi protein sorting. By immunoprecipitation, it was found that Btn2 bound the yeast endocytic SNARE complex (e.g., Snc1 and Snc2 [Snc1/2], Tlg1, Tlg2, and Vti1), the Snx4 sorting nexin, and retromer (e.g., Vps26 and Vps35). In in vitro binding assays, recombinant His(6)-tagged Btn2 bound glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Snc1 and GST-Vps26. Btn2-green fluorescent protein and Btn2-red fluorescent protein colocalize with Tlg2, Snx4, and Vps27 to a compartment adjacent to the vacuole that corresponds to a late endosome. The deletion of BTN2 blocks Yif1 retrieval back to the Golgi apparatus, while the localization of Ste2, Fur4, Snc1, Vps10, carboxypeptidases Y (CPY) and S (CPS), Sed5, and Sec7 is unaltered in btn2Delta cells. Yif1 delivery to the vacuole was observed in other late endosome-Golgi trafficking mutants, including ypt6Delta, snx4Delta, and vps26Delta cells.

The identification of the genetic programs controlling these elaborated and highly precise features of organogenesis is crucial to understand how a mature organ works under normal conditions, and how pathologies can develop. Recently, a number of studies have reported a critical role for Hox genes in one example of organogenesis: cardiogenesis in Drosophila. Beyond the interest in understanding the molecular basis of functional cardiogenesis, this system might provide a model for proposing new paradigms of how Hox genes achieve their action throughout development.",2007,"Laurent Perrin, Michel Sémériva, Maria Florencia Tevy, Maria Capovilla, Bruno Monier"
Signaling by ectopically expressed Drosophila Src64 requires the protein-tyrosine phosphatase corkscrew and the adapter downstream of receptor kinases,8930392,,"Vertebrate Src can be activated by specific mutations to become oncogenic. Analogous mutations in Drosophila Src64 (DSrc) induce abnormal differentiation of photoreceptor cells when expressed ectopically in the developing Drosophila adult eye. We have investigated the roles that the adapter protein, Downstream of receptor kinases (Drk), and the SH2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase, Corkscrew (Csw), play in this process. We find that dominant-negative mutations in either the drk or csw genes ameliorate the developmental abnormalities induced by activated DSrc. This suggests that Drk and Csw are required downstream of, or parallel to, DSrc. Csw does not act solely as an upstream activator of DSrc. The results are discussed in relation to potential roles for the vertebrate homologues of Drk and Csw (Grb2 and SHP2, respectively) in the transformation of fibroblasts by vertebrate Src.",1996,"S J Kussick, J A Cooper, M A Simon"

Interchromosomal communication coordinates intrinsically stochastic expression between alleles,24503853,10.1126/science.1243039,"Sensory systems use stochastic mechanisms to diversify neuronal subtypes. In the Drosophila eye, stochastic expression of the PAS-bHLH transcription factor Spineless (Ss) determines a random binary subtype choice in R7 photoreceptors. Here, we show that a stochastic, cell-autonomous decision to express ss is made intrinsically by each ss locus. Stochastic on or off expression of each ss allele is determined by combinatorial inputs from one enhancer and two silencers acting at long range. However, the two ss alleles also average their frequency of expression through up-regulatory and down-regulatory interallelic cross-talk. This inter- or intrachromosomal long-range regulation does not require endogenous ss chromosomal positioning or pairing. Therefore, although individual ss alleles make independent stochastic choices, interchromosomal communication coordinates expression state between alleles, ensuring that they are both expressed in the same random subset of R7s.",2014,"Robert J Johnston Jr, Claude Desplan"
Spit and venom from scytodes spiders: a diverse and distinct cocktail,24303891,10.1021/pr400875s,"Spiders from the family Scytodidae have a unique prey capturing technique: they spit a zig-zagged silken glue to tether prey to a surface. Effectiveness of this sticky mixture is based on a combination of contraction and adhesion, trapping prey until the spider immobilizes it by envenomation and then feeds. We identify components expressed in Scytodes thoracica venom glands using combined transcriptomic and proteomic analyses. These include homologues of toxic proteins astacin metalloproteases and potentially toxic proteins including venom allergen, longistatin, and translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP). We classify 19 distinct groups of candidate peptide toxins; 13 of these were detected in the venom, making up 35% of the proteome. Six have significant similarity to toxins from spider species spanning mygalomorph and nonhaplogyne araneomorph lineages, suggesting their expression in venom is phylogenetically widespread. Twelve peptide toxin groups have homologues in venom gland transcriptomes of other haplogynes. Of the transcripts, approximately 50% encode glycine-rich peptides that may contribute to sticky fibers in Scytodes spit. Fifty-one percent of the identified venom proteome is a family of proteins that is homologous to sequences from Drosophila sp. and Latrodectus hesperus with uncharacterized function. Characterization of these components holds promise for discovering new functional activity.",2014,"Sandra M Correa, Jessica E Garb, Greta J Binford, Pamela A Zobel-Thropp"
A migrating ciliary gate compartmentalizes the site of axoneme assembly in Drosophila spermatids,25447994,10.1016/j.cub.2014.09.047,"Background: In most cells, the cilium is formed within a compartment separated from the cytoplasm. Entry into the ciliary compartment is regulated by a specialized gate located at the base of the cilium in a region known as the transition zone. The transition zone is closely associated with multiple structures of the ciliary base, including the centriole, axoneme, and ciliary membrane. However, the contribution of these structures to the ciliary gate remains unclear. Results: Here we report that, in Drosophila spermatids, a conserved module of transition zone proteins mutated in Meckel-Gruber syndrome (MKS), including Cep290, Mks1, B9d1, and B9d2, comprise a ciliary gate that continuously migrates away from the centriole to compartmentalize the growing axoneme tip. We show that Cep290 is essential for transition zone composition, compartmentalization of the axoneme tip, and axoneme integrity and find that MKS proteins also delimit a centriole-independent compartment in mouse spermatids. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that the ciliary gate can migrate away from the base of the cilium, thereby functioning independently of the centriole and of a static interaction with the axoneme to compartmentalize the site of axoneme assembly.",2014,"Abhishek Chadha, Andrey Polyanovsky, Tomer Avidor-Reiss, Marcus L Basiri, Andrew Ha, Boaz Cook, Nicole M Clark"

Our results revealed contrasting effects of HP1 knockdown on gene activity. While the Bub1 gene decreased in expression level in HP1 knockdown animals, NOR activity, rRNA and, contrarily to previous reports in Drosophila, Hsp70 gene expression remained unchanged. Furthermore, HP1 knockdown resulted in abnormal chromatin condensation, chromosomal bridges, higher frequency of macrospermatids, loss of muscle mass and hemolymph amount as well as a low number of dividing cells and survival reduction.

We found that inactivation of the neurons transfected with HSV-CREB during training disrupted memory for tone conditioning, whereas inactivation of a similar proportion of transfected control neurons did not. Whole-cell recordings of fluorescently tagged transfected neurons revealed that neurons with higher CREB levels are more excitable than neighboring neurons and showed larger synaptic efficacy changes following conditioning. Our findings demonstrate that CREB modulates the allocation of fear memory to specific cells in lateral amygdala and suggest that neuronal excitability is important in this process.",2009,"Jaejoon Won, Mikael Guzman Karlsson, Yu Zhou, Thomas Rogerson, Panayiota Poirazi, Jayaprakash Balaji, Rachael Neve, Alcino J Silva, Miou Zhou"

Conservation of the TGFbeta/Labial homeobox signaling loop in endoderm-derived cells between Drosophila and mammals,20339309,10.1159/000276895,"Background/aims: Midgut formation in Drosophila melanogaster is dependent upon the integrity of a signaling loop in the endoderm which requires the TGFbeta-related peptide, Decapentaplegic, and the Hox transcription factor, Labial. Interestingly, although Labial-like homeobox genes are present in mammals, their participation in endoderm morphogenesis is not clearly understood. Methods: We report the cloning, expression, localization, TGFbeta inducibility, and biochemical properties of the mammalian Labial-like homeobox, HoxA1, in exocrine pancreatic cells that are embryologically derived from the gut endoderm. Results: HoxA1 is expressed in pancreatic cell populations as two alternatively spliced messages, encoding proteins that share their N-terminal domain, but either lack or include the homeobox at the C-terminus. Transcriptional regulatory assays demonstrate that the shared N-terminal domain behaves as a strong transcriptional activator in exocrine pancreatic cells. HoxA1 is an early response gene for TGFbeta(1) in pancreatic epithelial cell populations and HoxA1 protein co-localizes with TGFbeta(1) receptors in the embryonic pancreatic epithelium at a time when exocrine pancreatic morphogenesis occurs (days E16 and E17). Conclusions: These results report a role for HoxA1 in linking TGFbeta-mediated signaling to gene expression in pancreatic epithelial cell populations, thus suggesting a high degree of conservation for a TGFbeta/labial signaling loop in endoderm-derived cells between Drosophila and mammals. and IAP.",2010,"Raul Urrutia, Issei Imoto, Brian Gebelein, Tiffany A Cook, Gwen A Lomberk"

"Crooked, coiled and crimpled are three Ly6-like proteins required for proper localization of septate junction components",20570942,10.1242/dev.052605,"Cellular junction formation is an elaborate process that is dependent on the regulated synthesis, assembly and membrane targeting of constituting components. Here, we report on three Drosophila Ly6-like proteins essential for septate junction (SJ) formation. SJs provide a paracellular diffusion barrier and appear molecularly and structurally similar to vertebrate paranodal septate junctions. We show that Crooked (Crok), a small GPI-anchored Ly6-like protein, is required for septa formation and barrier functions. In embryos that lack Crok, SJ components are produced but fail to accumulate at the plasma membrane. Crok is detected in intracellular puncta and acts tissue-autonomously, which suggests that it resides in intracellular vesicles to assist the cell surface localization of SJ components. In addition, we demonstrate that two related Ly6 proteins, Coiled (Cold) and Crimpled (Crim), are required for SJ formation and function in a tissue-autonomous manner, and that Cold also localizes to intracellular vesicles. Specifically, Crok and Cold are required for correct membrane trafficking of Neurexin IV, a central SJ component. The non-redundant requirement for Crok, Cold, Crim and Boudin (Bou; another Ly6 protein that was recently shown to be involved in SJ formation) suggests that members of this conserved family of proteins cooperate in the assembly of SJ components, possibly by promoting core SJ complex formation in intracellular compartments associated with membrane trafficking.",2010,"Anna Nilton, Kevin G Nyberg, Sunitha Byri, Ulf Nannmark, Kenzi Oshima, Fariba Zare, Richard G Fehon, Anne E Uv"

Modelling with ANIMO: between fuzzy logic and differential equations,27460034,10.1186/s12918-016-0286-z,"Background: Computational support is essential in order to reason on the dynamics of biological systems.

Biology experts are able to use ANIMO via a user interface specifically tailored for biological applications. In this paper we compare the use of ANIMO with some established formalisms on two case studies. Results: ANIMO is a powerful and user-friendly tool that can compete with existing continuous and discrete paradigms. We show this by presenting ANIMO models for two case studies: Drosophila melanogaster circadian clock, and signal transduction events downstream of TNF α and EGF in HT-29 human colon carcinoma cells. The models were originally developed with ODEs and fuzzy logic, respectively. Conclusions: Two biological case studies that have been modeled with respectively ODE and fuzzy logic models can be conveniently modeled using ANIMO. The ANIMO models require less parameters than ODEs and are more precise than fuzzy logic.

"Characterization of carbonic anhydrases from Riftia pachyptila, a symbiotic invertebrate from deep-sea hydrothermal vents",12696045,10.1002/prot.10295,"The symbiotic hydrothermal vent tubeworm Riftia pachyptila needs to supply its internal bacterial symbionts with carbon dioxide, their inorganic carbon source. Our aim in this study was to characterize the carbonic anhydrase (CA) involved in CO(2) transport and conversion at various steps in the plume and the symbiotic tissue, the trophosome. A complete 1209 kb cDNA has been sequenced from the trophosome and identified as a putative alpha-CA based on BLAST analysis and the similarities of total deduced amino-acid sequence with those from the GenBank database. In the plume, the putative CA sequence obtained from cDNA library screening was 90% identical to the trophosome CA, except in the first 77 nucleotides downstream from the initiation site identified on trophosome CA. A phylogenetic analysis showed that the annelidan Riftia CA (CARp) emerges clustered with invertebrate CAs, the arthropodan Drosophila CA and the cnidarian Anthopleura CA. This invertebrate cluster appeared as a sister group of the cluster comprising mitochondrial and cytosolic isoforms in vertebrates: CAV, CAI II and III, and CAVII. However, amino acid sequence alignment showed that Riftia CA was closer to cytosolic CA than to mitochondrial CA. Combined biochemical approaches revealed two cytosolic CAs with different molecular weights and pI's in the plume and the trophosome, and the occurrence of a membrane-bound CA isoform in addition to the cytosolic one in the trophosome. The physiologic roles of cytosolic CA in both tissues and supplementary membrane-bound CA isoform in the trophosome in the optimization of CO(2) transport and conversion are discussed.",2003,"Julia Morales, Jean-Marc Strub, Xavier Bailly, Marie-Cécile De Cian, Alain Van Dorsselaer, François H Lallier"
Developmental pathways in musculoskeletal neoplasia: involvement of the Indian Hedgehog-parathyroid hormone-related protein pathway,12612211,10.1203/01.PDR.0000054688.93486.18,"There are many crucial genes and signaling pathways in the proper development of an organism. Pathologies may arise from a deregulation of these pathways. The Indian Hedgehog-PTH-related protein (Ihh-PTHrP) pathway is vital in the proper development of endochondral bones, such as the long bones. The Ihh-PTHrP pathway regulates the rate at which chondrocytes within the growth plate proliferate and differentiate. Thus, this pathway allows for the longitudinal growth of bones. However, a disruption in this pathway may lead to enchondromas and osteochondromas, which are both childhood cartilaginous neoplasms. Recently, our lab identified a mutant receptor for PTHrP in enchondroma samples. Mice expressing this mutant receptor and mice with increased Ihh activity develop conditions similar to human enchondromatosis. Linkage analysis shows an association between EXT genes and osteochondromas in hereditary multiple exostoses syndrome. Studies in Drosophila and mice suggest EXT gene products play a role in the diffusion of hedgehog proteins. A mutation in EXT genes may result in an abnormal Ihh diffusion pattern leading to an osteochondroma. There are agents that inhibit Hedgehog signaling. These agents may be useful in the treatment of enchondromas and osteochondromas. This review will discuss the discovery of the Ihh-PTHrP pathway and its involvement in neoplasia, and will suggest possible novel therapeutic agents in the treatment of these cartilaginous neoplasms.",2003,"Benjamin A Alman, Tri Dung Tiet"
The Synaptonemal complex component C(2)M regulates meiotic crossing over in Drosophila,12593793,10.1016/s0960-9822(03)00050-2,"Background: The synaptonemal complex (SC) is a proteinaceous structure that forms between homologously paired meiotic chromosomes. Previous studies have suggested that the SC is required for meiotic crossing over in Drosophila. However, only one component of this structure, C(3)G, has been identified in Drosophila. Results: Mutations in c(2)M cause a reduced frequency of meiotic crossing over due, in part, to how recombination events are resolved. Cytological evidence suggests that C(2)M is a component of the SC and is required for the assembly of C(3)G (a putative transverse filament of the SC) along the chromosomes. Additionally, C(2)M localizes along the chromosomes in the absence of C(3)G. Despite having a defect in C(3)G localization, c(2)M mutants unexpectedly affect crossing over less severely than a c(3)G mutant. There is virtually no crossing over in a c(3)G mutant, but c(2)M or c(2)M; c(3)G double mutants produce a substantial number of crossovers. The appearance of C(3)G-independent crossovers in c(2)M mutants suggests that C(2)M prevents recombination in the absence of complete SC formation. Conclusions: We have identified a new Drosophila SC component, C(2)M, that promotes the formation of crossovers. Furthermore, the appearance of C(3)G-independent crossovers in c(2)M mutants suggests a novel role in preventing recombination in the absence of complete SC.",2003,"Kim S McKim, Elizabeth A Manheim"

We compared several D. suzukii traps and lures/baits at two sites in Florida. The traps evaluated included Trécé, Scentry, and a standard homemade cup trap. These traps were compared with various baits and lures, including Trécé lure, Scentry lure, yeast bait, and Suzukii trap, under Florida production systems. Early detection is important to develop an effective monitoring system so management action can be taken before economic damage occurs. Data were recorded as overall trends, as well as in 4-5 trapping periods from early to late season. Overall, the Scentry trap baited with Scentry lure, the Trécé trap baited with Trécé lure + yeast, and the Trécé trap baited with Scentry lure were the best performing traps. Yeast-based traps were also attractive to D. suzukii early in the season, but they did not provide consistent captures as the season progressed. The Scentry trap with yeast bait, the Scentry trap with Scentry lure, the Trécé trap with Trécé lure + yeast bait, and a cup trap with yeast bait caught most of the flies during the first trapping period in 2015 and 2016 in the rabbiteye blueberry. In the southern highbush blueberry, the population of D. suzukii was much lower than in the rabbiteye blueberry planting, and the Scentry trap with Scentry lure captured the highest number of flies during the first trapping period in 2016. In the blackberry, the Scentry trap with Scentry lure numerically had the highest captures during the first trapping period, but this was not significantly different from the cup trap with yeast bait, the Trécé trap baited with Suzukii trap, and the Trécé trap with Trécé lure.

Combover interacts with the axonemal component Rsp3 and is required for Drosophila sperm individualization,31391193,10.1242/dev.179275,"Gamete formation is key to survival of higher organisms. In male animals, spermatogenesis gives rise to interconnected spermatids that differentiate and individualize into mature sperm, each tightly enclosed by a plasma membrane. In Drosophila melanogaster, individualization of sister spermatids requires the formation of specialized actin cones that synchronously move along the sperm tails, removing inter-spermatid bridges and most of the cytoplasm. Here, we show that Combover (Cmb), originally identified as an effector of planar cell polarity (PCP) under control of Rho kinase, is essential for sperm individualization. cmb mutants are male sterile, with actin cones that fail to move in a synchronized manner along the flagella, despite being correctly formed and polarized initially. These defects are germline autonomous, independent of PCP genes, and can be rescued by wild-type Cmb, but not by a version of Cmb in which known Rho kinase phosphorylation sites are mutated. Furthermore, Cmb binds to the axonemal component Radial spoke protein 3, knockdown of which causes similar individualization defects, suggesting that Cmb coordinates the individualization machinery with the microtubular axonemes.",2019,"Prathibha Yarikipati, Josefa Steinhauer, Benjamin Statman, Satya Surabhi, Daniel Edelman, Andreas Jenny, Jacob Borck, Jeremy K Fagan"
Characterization of the Drosophila melanogaster alkali-metal/proton exchanger (NHE) gene family,11719534,,"The NHE family of Na+/H+ exchangers is believed to play an essential role in animals, but may play an additional, specialised epithelial role in insects. The pharmacological sensitivity of the Drosophila melanogaster Malpighian tubule to a range of amiloride derivatives was shown to be consistent with an effect on an exchanger, rather than a Na+ channel. Consistent with this, no degenerin/epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) genes could be detected in Malpighian tubules by reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Using a low-stringency homology searching, three members of the NHE family were identified in the genomic sequence of Drosophila melanogaster, although only two genes were represented as expressed sequence tags. All three genes (DmNHE1 at cytological position 21B1, DmNHE2 at 39B1 and DmNHE3 at 27A1) were found by RT-PCR to be widely expressed, and one (DmNHE2) was shown to have multiple transcripts.

Notch signaling targets the Wingless responsiveness of a Ubx visceral mesoderm enhancer in Drosophila,11301248,10.1016/s0960-9822(01)00120-8,"Background: Members of the Notch family of receptors mediate a process known as lateral inhibition that plays a prominent role in the suppression of cell fates during development. This function is triggered by a ligand, Delta, and is implemented by the release of the intracellular domain of Notch from the membrane and by its interaction with the protein Suppressor of Hairless [Su(H)] in the nucleus. There is evidence that Notch can also signal independently of Su(H). In particular, in Drosophila, there is evidence that a Su(H)-independent activity of Notch is associated with Wingless signaling. Results: We report that Ubx(VM)B, a visceral mesoderm-specific enhancer of the Ubx gene of Drosophila, is sensitive to Notch signaling. In the absence of Notch, but not of Su(H), the enhancer becomes activated earlier and over a wider domain than in the wild type. Furthermore, the removal of Notch reduces the requirement for Disheveled-mediated Wingless signaling to activate this enhancer. This response to Notch is likely to be mediated by the dTcf binding sites in the Ubx(VM)B enhancer. Conclusions: Our results show that, in Drosophila, an activity of Notch that is likely to be independent of Su(H) inhibits Wingless signaling on Ubx(VM)B. A possible target of this activity is dTcf. As dTcf has been shown to be capable of repressing Wingless targets, our results suggest that this repressive activity may be regulated by Notch. Finally, we suggest that Wingless signaling is composed of two steps, a down-regulation of a Su(H)-independent Notch activity that modulates the activity of dTcf and a canonical Wingless signaling event that regulates the activity of Armadillo and its interaction with dTcf.",2001,"N Lawrence, T Langdon, K Brennan, A M Arias"

It is required for the proximal-distal transmission of an intercellular polarity signal, a process that is expected to be at least partly extracellular. It is also required for cells to respond to the polarity signal, which is expected to be a cytoplasmic function. The fz locus could encode either one bifunctional or two single-function proteins. We report here that, in pupae, fz produces a messenger RNA that encodes a protein with seven putative transmembrane domains. Thus, the Fz protein should contain both extracellular and cytoplasmic domains, which could function in the transmission and interpretation of polarity information, respectively. This is the first reported sequence for the protein product of a tissue polarity gene.",1989,"P N Adler, S Conover, C R Vinson"
The homeotic gene Sex Combs Reduced of Drosophila: gene structure and embryonic expression,2565809,,"The homeotic gene Sex Combs Reduced (Scr) of Drosophila is required during embryogenesis for labial and first thoracic segment development. We define the Scr gene structure, showing that the major embryonic transcript is proximal to the fushi tarazu gene, and report the sequence of the transcript, which encodes a 413-amino acid, homeodomain-containing protein. We describe Scr protein distribution throughout embryogenesis. Expression begins at gastrulation and is eventually apparent in three tissues, epidermis, nervous system and visceral mesoderm, though there are clear contrasts in the domains of expression in these three tissues.",1989,"L I Fessler, P K LeMotte, A Kuroiwa, W J Gehring"
Arrestin1 mediates light-dependent rhodopsin endocytosis and cell survival,16213818,10.1016/j.cub.2005.08.064,"Background: Arrestins are pivotal, multifunctional organizers of cell responses to GPCR stimulation, including cell survival and cell death. In Drosophila norpA and rdgC mutants, endocytosis of abnormally stable complexes of rhodopsin (Rh1) and fly photoreceptor Arrestin2 (Arr2) triggers cell death, implicating Rh1/Arr2-bearing endosomes in pro-cell death signaling, potentially via arrestin-mediated GPCR activation of effector kinase pathways. In order to further investigate arrestin function in photoreceptor physiology and survival, we studied Arr2's partner photoreceptor arrestin, Arr1, in developing and adult Drosophila compound eyes. Results: We report that Arr1, but not Arr2, is essential for normal, light-induced rhodopsin endocytosis. Also distinct from Arr2, Arr1 is essential for light-independent photoreceptor survival. Photoreceptor cell death caused by loss of Arr1 is strongly suppressed by coordinate loss of Arr2. We further find that Rh1 C-terminal phosphorylation is essential for light-induced endocytosis and also for translocation of Arr1, but not Arr2, from dark-adapted photoreceptor cytoplasm to photosensory membrane rhabdomeres. In contrast to a previous report, we do not find a requirement for photoreceptor myosin kinase NINAC in Arr1 or Arr2 translocation. Conclusions: The two Drosophila photoreceptor arrestins mediate distinct and essential cell pathways downstream of rhodopsin activation. We propose that Arr1 mediates an endocytotic cell-survival activity, scavenging phosphorylated rhodopsin and thereby countering toxic Arr2/Rh1 accumulation; elimination of toxic Arr2/Rh1 in double mutants could thus rescue arr1 mutant photoreceptor degeneration.",2005,"Akiko K Satoh, Donald F Ready"
Dynein anchors its mRNA cargo after apical transport in the Drosophila blastoderm embryo,16009136,10.1016/j.cell.2005.04.033,"Molecular motors actively transport many types of cargo along the cytoskeleton in a wide range of organisms. One class of cargo is localized mRNAs, which are transported by myosin on actin filaments or by kinesin and dynein on microtubules. How the cargo is kept at its final intracellular destination and whether the motors are recycled after completion of transport are poorly understood. Here, we use a new RNA anchoring assay in living Drosophila blastoderm embryos to show that apical anchoring of mRNA after completion of dynein transport does not depend on actin or on continuous active transport by the motor. Instead, apical anchoring of RNA requires microtubules and involves dynein as a static anchor that remains with the cargo at its final destination. We propose a general principle that could also apply to other dynein cargo and to some other molecular motors, whereby cargo transport and anchoring reside in the same molecule.",2005,"Ilan Davis, Renald Delanoue"
Does dietary restriction really increase longevity in Drosophila melanogaster?,16051527,10.1016/j.arr.2004.12.001,"It is often accepted that dietary restriction (DR) increases longevity in most species so far tested. Showing the same result in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster would be of interest, because this species is widely used in aging research. Some studies have shown that dietary restriction decreases longevity in this species while the opposite result has also been reported. However, some recent results appear to be flawed due to the use of not optimal control rearing conditions. It is argued that, for the time being, it cannot be concluded that dietary restriction increases longevity in D. melanogaster. It has also been shown in other fly species that dietary restriction does not increase longevity.",2005,"Eric Le Bourg, Nadège Minois"
Removal of background signal from in situ data on the expression of segmentation genes in Drosophila,15711806,10.1007/s00427-005-0472-2,"Here we present a method for the removal of nonspecific background signal from fluorescently localized expression patterns of Drosophila segmentation genes. Our algorithm for removal of background signal brings the data to a common standard form with zero background and removes systematic error in gene expression levels caused by the presence of background. The method is based on the discovery, reported here, that background is well fit by a very broad two-dimensional paraboloid. The paraboloid is determined from the area of the embryo in which a given gene is not expressed and the whole pattern is then normalized by this paraboloid to remove background from the entire embryo.

Dynamical analysis of regulatory interactions in the gap gene system of Drosophila melanogaster,15342511,10.1534/genetics.104.027334,"Genetic studies have revealed that segment determination in Drosophila melanogaster is based on hierarchical regulatory interactions among maternal coordinate and zygotic segmentation genes. The gap gene system constitutes the most upstream zygotic layer of this regulatory hierarchy, responsible for the initial interpretation of positional information encoded by maternal gradients. We present a detailed analysis of regulatory interactions involved in gap gene regulation based on gap gene circuits, which are mathematical gene network models used to infer regulatory interactions from quantitative gene expression data. Our models reproduce gap gene expression at high accuracy and temporal resolution. Regulatory interactions found in gap gene circuits provide consistent and sufficient mechanisms for gap gene expression, which largely agree with mechanisms previously inferred from qualitative studies of mutant gene expression patterns. Our models predict activation of Kr by Cad and clarify several other regulatory interactions. Our analysis suggests a central role for repressive feedback loops between complementary gap genes. We observe that repressive interactions among overlapping gap genes show anteroposterior asymmetry with posterior dominance. Finally, our models suggest a correlation between timing of gap domain boundary formation and regulatory contributions from the terminal maternal system.",2004,"Konstantin N Kozlov, Manu, Johannes Jaeger, Ekaterina Myasnikova, Maria Samsonova, David H Sharp, Maxim Blagov, John Reinitz, David Kosman, Carlos E Vanario-Alonso, Svetlana Surkova"
SIX1 mutations cause branchio-oto-renal syndrome by disruption of EYA1-SIX1-DNA complexes,15141091,10.1073/pnas.0308475101,"Urinary tract malformations constitute the most frequent cause of chronic renal failure in the first two decades of life. Branchio-otic (BO) syndrome is an autosomal dominant developmental disorder characterized by hearing loss. In branchio-oto-renal (BOR) syndrome, malformations of the kidney or urinary tract are associated. Haploinsufficiency for the human gene EYA1, a homologue of the Drosophila gene eyes absent (eya), causes BOR and BO syndromes. We recently mapped a locus for BOR/BO syndrome (BOS3) to human chromosome 14q23.1. Within the 33-megabase critical genetic interval, we located the SIX1, SIX4, and SIX6 genes, which act within a genetic network of EYA and PAX genes to regulate organogenesis. These genes, therefore, represented excellent candidate genes for BOS3. By direct sequencing of exons, we identified three different SIX1 mutations in four BOR/BO kindreds, thus identifying SIX1 as a gene causing BOR and BO syndromes. To elucidate how these mutations cause disease, we analyzed the functional role of these SIX1 mutations with respect to protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions. We demonstrate that all three mutations are crucial for Eya1-Six1 interaction, and the two mutations within the homeodomain region are essential for specific Six1-DNA binding. Identification of SIX1 mutations as causing BOR/BO offers insights into the molecular basis of otic and renal developmental diseases in humans.",2004,"Eugene H Chang, Edgar A Otto, Derek Silvius, Michael Gattas, Thomas J Neuhaus, Richard M Raymond Jr, Christine Petit, Jennifer Berkman, Charles Schwartz, Richard J H Smith, Frank Beekmann, Dominique Weil, Pin-Xian Xu, Patrick D Brophy, Valentine Hyland, Ulla T Muerb, Markus J Kemper, Eva-Maria Ruf, Rainer G Ruf, Constantine A Stratakis, Shrawan Kumar, Friedhelm Hildebrandt"
Why there is a one-way crossability between D. melanogaster and D. simulans? An ontogenic explanation,15088667,10.1023/b:gene.0000017650.45464.f4,"In the Drosophila melanogaster complex, females D. melanogaster mate relatively easily with males Drosophila simulans but the reciprocal cross is rare. The species sexual isolation is mainly based on chemical and acoustic signal exchanges between partners. The male side of this communication is investigated in this paper in order to understand the asymmetry. In D. melanogaster the acoustic signature is highly significant, and is synergistically reinforced by the chemical signal. In D. simulans the importance of the two signaling channels seems to be reversed. This could explain why D. simulans males produce less precise interpulse interval (IPI) mean value in the courtship song, which can readily overlap those of D. melanogaster. As the males of the two species use the same chemical key, D. simulans males could be recognized by D. melanogaster females as a conspecific.",2004,"Bruno Moulin, Thierry Aubin, Jean-Marc Jallon"
Notch signaling,7716513,10.1126/science.7716513,"The Notch/Lin-12/Glp-1 receptor family mediates the specification of numerous cell fates during development in Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans. Studies on the expression, mutant phenotypes, and developmental consequences of unregulated receptor activation have implicated these proteins in a general mechanism of local cell signaling, which includes interactions between equivalent cells and between different cell types. Genetic approaches in flies and worms have identified putative components of the signaling cascade, including a conserved family of extracellular ligands and two cellular factors that may associate with the Notch Intracellular domain. One factor, the Drosophila Suppressor of Hairless protein, is a DNA-binding protein, which suggests that Notch signaling may involve relatively direct signal transmission from the cell surface to the nucleus. Several vertebrate Notch receptors have also been discovered recently and play important roles in normal development and tumorigenesis.",1995,"S Artavanis-Tsakonas, K Matsuno, M E Fortini"
Atypical phytochrome gene structure in the green alga Mesotaenium caldariorum,8616213,10.1007/BF00020457,"The phytochrome photoreceptor in the green alga Mesotaenium caldariorum is encoded by a small family of highly related genes. DNA sequence analysis of two of the algal phytochrome genes indicates an atypical gene structure with numerous long introns. The two genes, termed mesphy1a and mesphy1b, encode polypeptides which differ by one amino acid in the region of overlap that was sequenced. RT-PCR studies have established the intron-exon junctions of both genes and show that both are expressed. RNA blot analysis indicates a single transcript of ca. 4.1 kb in length. The deduced amino acid sequence of the mesphy1b gene reveals that the photoreceptor consists of 1142 amino acids, with an overall structure similar to other phytochromes. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that the algal phytochrome falls into a distinct subfamily with other lower plant phytochromes. Profile analysis of an internal repeat found within the central hinge region of the phytochrome polypeptide indicates an evolutionary relatedness to the photoactive yellow protein from the purple bacterium Ectothiorhodospira halophila, to several bacterial sensor kinase family members, and to a family of eukaryotic regulatory proteins which includes the period clock (per) and single-minded (sim) gene products of Drosophila. Since mutations which alter phytochrome activity cluster within the region delimited by these direct repeats (P.H.

The cross-linking agent hexamethylphosphoramide predominantly induces intra-locus and multi-locus deletions in postmeiotic germ cells of Drosophila,7713422,,"The nature of DNA sequence changes induced by the cross-linking agent hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA) within and in the vicinity of the vermilion locus of Drosophila melanogaster that produce a vermilion mutant phenotype was analyzed after exposure of postmeiotic male germ cells. Mutagenized males were mated to either females wild-type (exr+) for nucleotide excision repair (NER) or to females having a deficiency (exr-) for NER. Rearrangements, mostly deletions, represented by far the most frequent type of mutational events induced by HMPA that are detected as vermilion mutations. In the exr+ group, all but one (a double substitution) of 21 mutants characterized were large sequence changes: we found 5 intra-locus deletions, 3 intra-locus deletions associated with insertions and 12 multi-locus deletions. When taken together, deletions and deletion/insertion mutations represent 96% of the HMPA-induced DNA modifications obtained under proficient repair conditions. Of the 10 mutants obtained from crosses with exr- females, 6 intra-locus and 2 multi-locus deletions were found, as opposed to just 1 point mutation and 1 double substitution. The ""hypomutability effect"" observed with exr- genotypes in relation to the wild type seems to be caused by a decrease in the frequency of multi-locus deletions in the former group. The results suggest that the NER system is involved in the generation of multi-locus deletions, whereas intra-locus deletions appear to be formed through a postreplication slipped-misrepair pathway. It is concluded that an eukaryotic in vivo system with no limitations for the recovery of multi-locus deletions, such as vermilion, should be used for the analysis of DNA damage induced by cross-linking agents.",1995,"M A Comendador, M J Nivard, I Aguirrezabalaga, E W Vogel"
Compartmentalized calcium transients trigger dendrite pruning in Drosophila sensory neurons,23722427,10.1126/science.1234879,"Dendrite pruning is critical for sculpting the final connectivity of neural circuits as it removes inappropriate projections, yet how neurons can selectively eliminate unnecessary dendritic branches remains elusive. Here, we show that calcium transients that are compartmentalized in specific dendritic branches act as temporal and spatial cues to trigger pruning in Drosophila sensory neurons. Calcium transients occurred in local dendrites at ~3 hours before branch elimination. In dendritic branches, intrinsic excitability increased locally to activate calcium influx via the voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs), and blockade of the VGCC activities impaired pruning. Further genetic analyses suggest that the calcium-activated protease calpain functions downstream of the calcium transients. Our findings reveal the importance of the compartmentalized subdendritic calcium signaling in spatiotemporally selective elimination of dendritic branches.",2013,"Makoto I Kanai, Yusuke Dairyo, Takahiro Kanamori, Rei K Morikawa, Kei-ichiro Yasunaga, Kazuo Emoto"

FGF /FGFR signal induces trachea extension in the drosophila visual system,23991208,10.1371/journal.pone.0073878,"The Drosophila compound eye is a large sensory organ that places a high demand on oxygen supplied by the tracheal system. Although the development and function of the Drosophila visual system has been extensively studied, the development and contribution of its tracheal system has not been systematically examined. To address this issue, we studied the tracheal patterns and developmental process in the Drosophila visual system. We found that the retinal tracheae are derived from air sacs in the head, and the ingrowth of retinal trachea begin at mid-pupal stage. The tracheal development has three stages. First, the air sacs form near the optic lobe in 42-47% of pupal development (pd). Second, in 47-52% pd, air sacs extend branches along the base of the retina following a posterior-to-anterior direction and further form the tracheal network under the fenestrated membrane (TNUFM). Third, the TNUFM extend fine branches into the retina following a proximal-to-distal direction after 60% pd. Furthermore, we found that the trachea extension in both retina and TNUFM are dependent on the FGF(Bnl)/FGFR(Btl) signaling. Our results also provided strong evidence that the photoreceptors are the source of the Bnl ligand to guide the trachea ingrowth. Our work is the first systematic study of the tracheal development in the visual system, and also the first study demonstrating the interactions of two well-studied systems: the eye and trachea.",2013,"Yuan-Ming Lee, Yi Henry Sun, Wei-Chen Chu"
Contrasting patterns of evolutionary constraint and novelty revealed by comparative sperm proteomic analysis in Lepidoptera,29197336,10.1186/s12864-017-4293-2,"Background: Rapid evolution is a hallmark of reproductive genetic systems and arises through the combined processes of sequence divergence, gene gain and loss, and changes in gene and protein expression. While studies aiming to disentangle the molecular ramifications of these processes are progressing, we still know little about the genetic basis of evolutionary transitions in reproductive systems. Here we conduct the first comparative analysis of sperm proteomes in Lepidoptera, a group that exhibits dichotomous spermatogenesis, in which males produce a functional fertilization-competent sperm (eupyrene) and an incompetent sperm morph lacking nuclear DNA (apyrene). Through the integrated application of evolutionary proteomics and genomics, we characterize the genomic patterns potentially associated with the origination and evolution of this unique spermatogenic process and assess the importance of genetic novelty in Lepidopteran sperm biology. Results: Comparison of the newly characterized Monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) sperm proteome to those of the Carolina sphinx moth (Manduca sexta) and the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) demonstrated conservation at the level of protein abundance and post-translational modification within Lepidoptera. In contrast, comparative genomic analyses across insects reveals significant divergence at two levels that differentiate the genetic architecture of sperm in Lepidoptera from other insects. First, a significant reduction in orthology among Monarch sperm genes relative to the remainder of the genome in non-Lepidopteran insect species was observed. Second, a substantial number of sperm proteins were found to be specific to Lepidoptera, in that they lack detectable homology to the genomes of more distantly related insects. Lastly, the functional importance of Lepidoptera specific sperm proteins is broadly supported by their increased abundance relative to proteins conserved across insects. Conclusions: Our results identify a burst of genetic novelty amongst sperm proteins that may be associated with the origin of heteromorphic spermatogenesis in ancestral Lepidoptera and/or the subsequent evolution of this system. This pattern of genomic diversification is distinct from the remainder of the genome and thus suggests that this transition has had a marked impact on lepidopteran genome evolution. The identification of abundant sperm proteins unique to Lepidoptera, including proteins distinct between specific lineages, will accelerate future functional studies aiming to understand the developmental origin of dichotomous spermatogenesis and the functional diversification of the fertilization incompetent apyrene sperm morph.",2017,"Timothy L Karr, Emma Whittington, Kirill Borziak, Desiree Forsythe, James R Walters, Steve Dorus"
Achilles is a circadian clock-controlled gene that regulates immune function in Drosophila,27856350,10.1016/j.bbi.2016.11.012,"The circadian clock is a transcriptional/translational feedback loop that drives the rhythmic expression of downstream mRNAs. Termed ""clock-controlled genes,"" these molecular outputs of the circadian clock orchestrate cellular, metabolic, and behavioral rhythms. As part of our on-going work to characterize key upstream regulators of circadian mRNA expression, we have identified a novel clock-controlled gene in Drosophila melanogaster, Achilles (Achl), which is rhythmic at the mRNA level in the brain and which represses expression of antimicrobial peptides in the immune system. Achilles knock-down in neurons dramatically elevates expression of crucial immune response genes, including IM1 (Immune induced molecule 1), Mtk (Metchnikowin), and Drs (Drosomysin). As a result, flies with knocked-down Achilles expression are resistant to bacterial challenges. Meanwhile, no significant change in core clock gene expression and locomotor activity is observed, suggesting that Achilles influences rhythmic mRNA outputs rather than directly regulating the core timekeeping mechanism. Notably, Achilles knock-down in the absence of immune challenge significantly diminishes the fly's overall lifespan, indicating a behavioral or metabolic cost of constitutively activating this pathway. Together, our data demonstrate that (1) Achilles is a novel clock-controlled gene that (2) regulates the immune system, and (3) participates in signaling from neurons to immunological tissues.",2017,"Jiajia Li, Erin E Terry, Maria J Scuderi, Michael E Hughes, Daniel Michalski, Michael Kunst, Edith Fejer, Natalie Hartmann, Lisa E Rois, Joseph Logsdon, Diana Gamba"
"Steroidogenic factor I, a key regulator of steroidogenic enzyme expression, is the mouse homolog of fushi tarazu-factor I",1406703,10.1210/mend.6.8.1406703,"We proposed that a cell-selective regulatory protein coordinately regulates the expression of three enzymes that are required for the biosynthesis of corticosteroids: cholesterol side chain cleavage enzyme, steroid 21-hydroxylase, and the aldosterone synthase isozyme of steroid 11 beta-hydroxylase. In this report, we identify a 53-kilodalton protein, termed steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1), that interacts with the related promoter elements from these steroidogenic enzymes, and we isolate and characterize a cDNA that very likely encodes this protein. We first showed that nuclear extracts from bovine adrenal glands interact with the mouse steroidogenic regulatory elements, forming complexes indistinguishable from those produced by nuclear extracts from mouse Y1 adrenocortical cells. These bovine adrenal extracts were subjected to sequential ion exchange and affinity chromatography to yield a highly enriched preparation of SF-1. The predominant protein in the affinity-purified preparation comigrated with shift activity and had a mol wt of 53,000; UV cross-linking experiments demonstrated directly that this 53-kilodalton protein interacted with the steroidogenic regulatory element. Even with this marked enrichment, affinity-purified SF-1 bound six steroidogenic regulatory elements. These results support strongly the model that a steroidogenic cell-selective protein interacts with related promoter elements from three steroidogenic enzymes to regulate their coordinate expression. The recognition sequence of SF-1 closely resembles those of nuclear hormone receptor family members, suggesting that SF-1 may belong to this supergene family. By screening a Y1 cell cDNA library with the DNA-binding region of the H-2RIIBP nuclear hormone receptor cDNA, we isolated a cDNA that is selectively expressed in steroidogenic cells. When expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein in Escherichia. coli, the protein encoded by this cDNA interacts with all six related steroidogenic regulatory elements with a binding specificity indistinguishable from that of SF-1. Surprisingly, the sequence of the putative DNA-binding domain of this cDNA matches exactly the corresponding sequence of the mouse homolog of the Drosophila transcription factor fushi tarazu-factor I.

Cloning of Drosophila transcription factor Adf-1 reveals homology to Myb oncoproteins,1731341,10.1073/pnas.89.2.683,"The Drosophila sequence-specific DNA binding protein, Adf-1, is capable of activating transcription of the alcohol dehydrogenase gene, Adh, and is implicated in the transcriptional control of other developmentally regulated genes. We have cloned the cDNA encoding Adf-1 by generating specific DNA probes deduced from partial amino acid sequence of the protein. Several cDNA clones encoding an extended open reading frame were isolated from a phage lambda library. The complete amino acid sequence of Adf-1 deduced from the longest cDNA reveals structural similarities to the putative helix-turn-helix DNA binding motif of Myb and Myb-related proteins. DNA sequence analysis of genomic clones and Northern blot analysis of mRNA suggest that Adf-1 is a single-copy gene encoding a 1.9-kb transcript. Purified recombinant Adf-1 expressed in Escherichia coli binds specifically to Adf-1 recognition sites and activates transcription of a synthetic Adh promoter in vitro in a manner indistinguishable from the protein purified from Drosophila. Temporally staged Drosophila embryos immunochemically stained with affinity-purified anti-Adf-1 antibodies indicate that Adf-1 protein is not detectable in very early embryos and does not appear to be maternally inherited. During later stages of embryogenesis, Adf-1 appears to be expressed in the nucleus of most somatic cells in the embryo with possibly higher concentrations found in some tissues.",1992,"B P England, A Admon, R Tjian"
