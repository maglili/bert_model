8007953,The ecdysone response enhancer of the Fbp1 gene of Drosophila melanogaster is a direct target for the EcR/USP nuclear receptor,"The transcription of the Drosophila melanogaster Fbp1 gene is induced by the steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone and restricted to the late-third-instar fat body tissue. In a previous study we showed that the -68 to -138 region relative to the transcription start site acts as an ecdysone-dependent third-instar fat body-specific enhancer in a transgenic assay. Here we report that seven nucleoprotein complexes are formed in vitro on this enhancer when a nuclear extract from late-third-instar fat body is used in a gel shift assay. Accurate mapping of the binding sites of the complexes revealed a remarkably symmetrical organization. Using specific antibodies, one of the complexes was identified as a heterodimer consisting of the ecdysone receptor (EcR) and Ultraspiracle (USP) proteins. The binding site of the heterodimer as defined by mutagenesis and methylation interference experiments bears strong sequence similarity to the canonical hsp27 ecdysone response element, including an imperfect palindromic structure. The two elements diverge at three positions in both half-sites, indicating that the structure of an active EcR/USP binding site allows considerable sequence variations. In vivo footprinting experiments using ligation-mediated PCR and wild-type or ecdysteroid-deficient larvae show that occupancy of the Fbp1 EcR/USP binding site and adjacent region is dependent on a high concentration of ecdysteroids. These results provide strong evidence for a direct role of the EcR/USP heterodimer in driving gene expression in response to changes of the ecdysteroid titer during Drosophila larval development.",10.1128/mcb.14.7.4465,1994,"C Antoniewski, M Laval, A Dahan, J A Lepesant"
11080162,Direct transcriptional control of the Dpp target omb by the DNA binding protein Brinker,"The gradient morphogen Decapentaplegic (Dpp) organizes pattern by inducing the transcription of different target genes at distinct threshold concentrations during Drosophila development. An important, albeit indirect, mode by which Dpp controls the spatial extent of its targets is via the graded downregulation of brinker, whose product in turn negatively regulates the expression of these targets. Here we report the molecular dissection of the cis-regulatory sequences of optomotor-blind (omb), a Dpp target gene in the wing. We identify a minimal 284 bp Dpp response element and demonstrate that it is subject to Brinker (Brk) repression. Using this omb wing enhancer, we show that Brk is a sequence-specific DNA binding protein. Mutations in the high-affinity Brk binding site abolish responsiveness of this omb enhancer to Brk and also compromise the input of an unknown transcriptional activator. Our results therefore identify Brk as a novel transcription factor antagonizing Dpp signalling by directly binding target genes and repressing their expression.",10.1093/emboj/19.22.6162,2000,"R Sivasankaran, M A Vigano, B Müller, M Affolter, K Basler"
26710299,Identification and Validation of Novel Hedgehog-Responsive Enhancers Predicted by Computational Analysis of Ci/Gli Binding Site Density,"The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway directs a multitude of cellular responses during embryogenesis and adult tissue homeostasis. Stimulation of the pathway results in activation of Hh target genes by the transcription factor Ci/Gli, which binds to specific motifs in genomic enhancers. In Drosophila, only a few enhancers (patched, decapentaplegic, wingless, stripe, knot, hairy, orthodenticle) have been shown by in vivo functional assays to depend on direct Ci/Gli regulation. All but one (orthodenticle) contain more than one Ci/Gli site, prompting us to directly test whether homotypic clustering of Ci/Gli binding sites is sufficient to define a Hh-regulated enhancer. We therefore developed a computational algorithm to identify Ci/Gli clusters that are enriched over random expectation, within a given region of the genome. Candidate genomic regions containing Ci/Gli clusters were functionally tested in chicken neural tube electroporation assays and in transgenic flies. Of the 22 Ci/Gli clusters tested, seven novel enhancers (and the previously known patched enhancer) were identified as Hh-responsive and Ci/Gli-dependent in one or both of these assays, including: Cuticular protein 100A (Cpr100A); invected (inv), which encodes an engrailed-related transcription factor expressed at the anterior/posterior wing disc boundary; roadkill (rdx), the fly homolog of vertebrate Spop; the segment polarity gene gooseberry (gsb); and two previously untested regions of the Hh receptor-encoding patched (ptc) gene. We conclude that homotypic Ci/Gli clustering is not sufficient information to ensure Hh-responsiveness; however, it can provide a clue for enhancer recognition within putative Hedgehog target gene loci.",10.1371/journal.pone.0145225,2015,"Katherine Gurdziel, David S Lorberbaum, Aaron M Udager, Jane Y Song, Neil Richards, David S Parker, Lisa A Johnson, Benjamin L Allen, Scott Barolo, Deborah L Gumucio"
22307950,Drosophila DREF acting via the JNK pathway is required for thorax development,"The Drosophila Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) gene basket (bsk) promoter contains a DNA replication-related element (DRE)-like sequence, raising the possibility of regulation by the DNA replication-related element-binding factor (DREF). Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays with anti-DREF IgG showed the bsk gene promoter region to be effectively amplified. Luciferase transient expression assays revealed the DRE-like sequence to be important for bsk gene promoter activity, and knockdown of DREF decreased the bsk mRNA level and the bsk gene promoter activity. Furthermore, knockdown of DREF in the notum compartment of wing discs by pannier-GAL4 and UAS-DREFIR resulted in a split thorax phenotype. Monitoring of JNK activity in the wing disc by LacZ expression in a puckered (puc)-LacZ enhancer trap line revealed the reduction in DREF knockdown clones. These findings indicate that DREF is involved in regulation of Drosophila thorax development via actions on the JNK pathway.",10.1002/dvg.22017,2012,"Yasuhide Yoshioka, Trong Tue Nguyen, Shunsuke Fujiwara, Risa Matsuda, Viviana Valadez-Graham, Mario Zurita, Masamitsu Yamaguchi"
10409761,Dual requirement for the EcR/USP nuclear receptor and the dGATAb factor in an ecdysone response in Drosophila melanogaster,"The EcR/USP nuclear receptor controls Drosophila metamorphosis by activating complex cascades of gene transcription in response to pulses of the steroid hormone ecdysone at the end of larval development. Ecdysone release provides a ubiquitous signal for the activation of the receptor, but a number of its target genes are induced in a tissue- and stage-specific manner. Little is known about the molecular mechanisms involved in this developmental modulation of the EcR/USP-mediated pathway. Fbp1 is a good model of primary ecdysone response gene expressed in the fat body for addressing this question. We show here that the dGATAb factor binds to three target sites flanking an EcR/USP binding site in a 70-bp enhancer that controls the tissue and stage specificity of Fbp1 transcription. We demonstrate that one of these sites and proper expression of dGATAb are required for specific activation of the enhancer in the fat body. In addition, we provide further evidence that EcR/USP plays an essential role as a hormonal timer. Our study provides a striking example of the integration of molecular pathways at the level of a tissue-specific hormone response unit.",10.1128/mcb.19.8.5732,1999,"V Brodu, B Mugat, J Y Roignant, J A Lepesant, C Antoniewski"
30315166,An expression atlas of variant ionotropic glutamate receptors identifies a molecular basis of carbonation sensing,"Through analysis of the Drosophila ionotropic receptors (IRs), a family of variant ionotropic glutamate receptors, we reveal that most IRs are expressed in peripheral neuron populations in diverse gustatory organs in larvae and adults. We characterise IR56d, which defines two anatomically-distinct neuron classes in the proboscis: one responds to carbonated solutions and fatty acids while the other represents a subset of sugar- and fatty acid-sensing cells. Mutational analysis indicates that IR56d, together with the broadly-expressed co-receptors IR25a and IR76b, is essential for physiological responses to carbonation and fatty acids, but not sugars. We further demonstrate that carbonation and fatty acids both promote IR56d-dependent attraction of flies, but through different behavioural outputs. Our work provides a toolkit for investigating taste functions of IRs, defines a subset of these receptors required for carbonation sensing, and illustrates how the gustatory system uses combinatorial expression of sensory molecules in distinct neurons to coordinate behaviour.",10.1038/s41467-018-06453-1,2018,"Juan Antonio Sánchez-Alcañiz, Ana Florencia Silbering, Vincent Croset, Giovanna Zappia, Anantha Krishna Sivasubramaniam, Liliane Abuin, Saumya Yashmohini Sahai, Daniel Münch, Kathrin Steck, Thomas O Auer, Steeve Cruchet, G Larisa Neagu-Maier, Simon G Sprecher, Carlos Ribeiro, Nilay Yapici, Richard Benton"
2897241,Differential regulation of Ultrabithorax in two germ layers of Drosophila,"The homeotic gene Ultrabithorax (Ubx) is expressed in specific parts of Drosophila embryos: in a single metamer in the visceral mesoderm and forming a complex pattern limited to a broad domain in the ectoderm and in the somatic mesoderm. Here we use a linked beta-galactosidase gene to identify cis-acting regulatory sequences. In the visceral mesoderm, correct expression of Ubx depends on localized upstream sequences. In the ectoderm, all galactosidase-positive transformants show the same characteristic pattern. The repeated elements of this basal pattern appear to be a sub-pattern of engrailed (en) expression; they depend on en function as well as on sequences in the Ubx RNA leader. We use a mutant (Haltere-mimic) to show that sequences that normally restrict segmental expression of Ubx in the ectoderm are located downstream from the RNA leader.",10.1016/0092-8674(88)90573-9,1988,"M Bienz, G Saari, G Tremml, J Müller, B Züst, P A Lawrence"
12086463,Combinatorial signaling by an unconventional Wg pathway and the Dpp pathway requires Nejire (CBP/p300) to regulate dpp expression in posterior tracheal branches,"The decapentaplegic (dpp) gene influences many developmental events in Drosophila melanogaster. We have been analyzing dpp expression in two groups of dorsal ectoderm cells at the posterior end of the embryo, in abdominal segment 8 and the telson. These dpp-expressing cells become tracheal cells in the posterior-most branches of the tracheal system (Dorsal Branch10, Spiracular Branch10, and the Posterior Spiracle). These branches are not identified by reagents typically used in analyses of tracheal development, suggesting that dpp expression confers a distinct identity upon posterior tracheal cells. We have determined that dpp posterior ectoderm expression begins during germ band extension and continues throughout development. We have isolated the sequences responsible for these aspects of dpp expression in a reporter gene. We have determined that an unconventional form of Wingless (Wg) signaling, Dpp signaling, and the transcriptional coactivator Nejire (CBP/p300) are required for the initiation and maintenance of dpp expression in the posterior-most branches of the tracheal system. Our data suggest a model for the integration of Wg and Dpp signals that may be applicable to branching morphogenesis in other developmental systems.",10.1006/dbio.2002.0693,2002,"N T Takaesu, A N Johnson, O H Sultani, S J Newfeld"
2318884,"Purified Drosophila transcription factor, Adh distal factor-1 (Adf-1), binds to sites in several Drosophila promoters and activates transcription","Adh distal factor-1 (Adf-1) is a sequence-specific DNA-binding activity originally identified in Drosophila tissue culture cells and embryos. Adf-1 binds to upstream recognition elements in each of the two promoters of the Drosophila alcohol dehydrogenase gene (Adh), and binding of Adf-1 to the Adh distal promoter site activates transcription. We have carried out a mutational analysis of the Adh distal promoter using both an in vitro transcription assay and a transient transfection assay in Drosophila tissue culture cells, and in both cases find that deletion of sequences required for Adf-1 binding leads to a 3-4-fold drop in transcription. We have purified Adf-1 and demonstrate by a sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel renaturation assay that it is a 34-kDa protein. Purified Adf-1 activates Adh distal promoter transcription in vitro in a binding site-dependent manner. DNase I footprint analysis shows that the purified protein binds not only to the two previously characterized sites in Adh but also to transcriptional regulatory elements in the dopa decarboxylase (Ddc) and Antennapedia (Antp) P1 promoters. Thus, it appears that Adf-1 may play an important role not only in the regulation of Adh expression but also in the transcription of other Drosophila genes as well.",,1990,"B P England, U Heberlein, R Tjian"
9651493,Homeotic regulation of segment-specific differences in neuroblast numbers and proliferation in the Drosophila central nervous system,"The number and pattern of neuroblasts that initially segregate from the neuroectoderm in the early Drosophila embryo is identical in thoracic and abdominal segments. However, during late embryogenesis differences in the numbers of neuroblasts and in the extent of neuroblast proliferation arise between these regions. We show that the homeotic genes Ultrabithorax and abdominal-A regulate these late differences, and that misexpression of either gene in thoracic neuroblasts after segregation is sufficient to induce abdominal behaviour. However, in wild type embryos we only detect abdominal-A and Ultrabithorax proteins in early neuroblasts. Furthermore, transplantation experiments reveal that segment-specific behaviour is determined prior to neuroblast segregation. Thus, the segment-specific differences in neuroblast behaviour seem to be determined in the early embryo, mediated through the expression of homeotic genes in early neuroblasts, and executed in later programmes controlling neuroblast numbers and proliferation.",10.1016/s0925-4773(98)00068-9,1998,"A Prokop, S Bray, E Harrison, G M Technau"
8345514,kappa B-like motifs regulate the induction of immune genes in Drosophila,"The mammalian transcription factor NF-kappa B regulates a number of genes involved in immune and acute phase responses, by interacting with a nucleotide sequence element, the kappa B-motif. In this work we demonstrate the participation of similar motifs in the immune response of insects as well: kappa B-like motifs have a regulatory role in the synthesis of cecropins, a set of anti-bacterial peptides, triggered by the presence of bacterial cell wall components in the insect blood. We show that the upstream region of the Cecropin gene CecA1 contains elements responsible for inducible and tissue-specific expression. Furthermore, a trimer of kappa B-like motif confers high levels of inducible expression from the reporter gene, after transfection in a Drosophila blood cell line. As in the moth Hyalophora cecropia, stimulation with bacterial lipopolysaccharide induces a nuclear factor that specifically binds to the kappa B-like motif. Our data suggest a functional and evolutionary relationship between these insect immune response factors and the mammalian NF-kappa B.",10.1006/jmbi.1993.1392,1993,"Y Engström, L Kadalayil, S C Sun, C Samakovlis, D Hultmark, I Faye"
9431812,Hedgehog signaling regulates transcription through Gli/Ci binding sites in the wingless enhancer,"The segment polarity gene cubitus interruptus (ci) encodes a transcriptional effector of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling in Drosophila. The Ci gene product is a zinc finger protein belonging to the Gli family of sequence-specific DNA binding proteins. After gastrulation, segmental expression of the segment polarity gene wingless (wg) is maintained by Hh signaling in a pathway requiring Ci activity. In the absence of Hh or Ci activity, wg expression is initiated normally and then fades in the ectoderm after stage 10. We have previously identified a wingless enhancer region whose Ci binding sites mediate Ci-dependent transcriptional activation in transiently transfected cells. Here we demonstrate that Hh and Patched (Ptc) act through those Ci binding sites to modulate the level of Ci-dependent transcriptional activation in S2 cells. We demonstrate that this same wg enhancer region is Hh responsive in vivo and that its Ci binding sites are necessary for its activity. This provides strong evidence that Hh affects wg transcription through post-translational activation of Ci.",10.1016/s0925-4773(97)00150-0,1997,"T Von Ohlen, J E Hooper"
22427741,Combinatorial activation and repression by seven transcription factors specify Drosophila odorant receptor expression,"The mechanism that specifies olfactory sensory neurons to express only one odorant receptor (OR) from a large repertoire is critical for odor discrimination but poorly understood. Here, we describe the first comprehensive analysis of OR expression regulation in Drosophila. A systematic, RNAi-mediated knock down of most of the predicted transcription factors identified an essential function of acj6, E93, Fer1, onecut, sim, xbp1, and zf30c in the regulation of more than 30 ORs. These regulatory factors are differentially expressed in antennal sensory neuron classes and specifically required for the adult expression of ORs. A systematic analysis reveals not only that combinations of these seven factors are necessary for receptor gene expression but also a prominent role for transcriptional repression in preventing ectopic receptor expression. Such regulation is supported by bioinformatics and OR promoter analyses, which uncovered a common promoter structure with distal repressive and proximal activating regions. Thus, our data provide insight into how combinatorial activation and repression can allow a small number of transcription factors to specify a large repertoire of neuron classes in the olfactory system.",10.1371/journal.pbio.1001280,2012,"Shadi Jafari, Liza Alkhori, Alexander Schleiffer, Anna Brochtrup, Thomas Hummel, Mattias Alenius"
18181151,Spatial regulation of Corazonin neuropeptide expression requires multiple cis-acting elements in Drosophila melanogaster,"Although most invertebrate neuropeptide-encoding genes display distinct expression patterns in the central nervous system (CNS), the molecular mechanisms underlying spatial regulation of the neuropeptide genes are largely unknown. Expression of the neuropeptide Corazonin (Crz) is limited to only 24 neurons in the larval CNS of Drosophila melanogaster, and these neurons have been categorized into three groups, namely, DL, DM, and vCrz. To identify cis-regulatory elements that control transcription of Crz in each neuronal group, reporter gene expression patterns driven by various 5' flanking sequences of Crz were analyzed to assess their promoter activities in the CNS. We show that the 504-bp 5' upstream sequence is the shortest promoter directing reporter activities in all Crz neurons. Further dissection of this sequence revealed two important regions responsible for group specificity: -504::-419 for DM expression and -380::-241 for DL and vCrz expression. The latter region is further subdivided into three sites (proximal, center, and distal), in which any combinations of the two are sufficient for DL expression, whereas both proximal and distal sites are required for vCrz expression. Interestingly, the TATA box does not play a role in Crz transcription in most neurons. We also show that a 434-bp 5' upstream sequence of the D. virilis Crz gene, when introduced into the D. melanogaster genome, drives reporter expression in the DL and vCrz neurons, suggesting that regulatory mechanisms for Crz expression in at least two such neuronal groups are conserved between the two species.",10.1002/cne.21594,2008,"Seung-Hoon Choi, Gyunghee Lee, Pamela Monahan, Jae H Park"
21167805,EGFR/Ras/MAPK signaling mediates adult midgut epithelial homeostasis and regeneration in Drosophila,"Many tissues in higher animals undergo dynamic homeostatic growth, wherein damaged or aged cells are replaced by the progeny of resident stem cells. To maintain homeostasis, stem cells must respond to tissue needs. Here we show that in response to damage or stress in the intestinal (midgut) epithelium of adult Drosophila, multiple EGFR ligands and rhomboids (intramembrane proteases that activate some EGFR ligands) are induced, leading to the activation of EGFR signaling in intestinal stem cells (ISCs). Activation of EGFR signaling promotes ISC division and midgut epithelium regeneration, thereby maintaining tissue homeostasis. ISCs defective in EGFR signaling cannot grow or divide, are poorly maintained, and cannot support midgut epithelium regeneration after enteric infection by the bacterium Pseudomonas entomophila. Furthermore, ISC proliferation induced by Jak/Stat signaling is dependent upon EGFR signaling. Thus the EGFR/Ras/MAPK signaling pathway plays central, essential roles in ISC maintenance and the feedback system that mediates intestinal homeostasis.",10.1016/j.stem.2010.11.026,2011,"Huaqi Jiang, Marc O Grenley, Maria-Jose Bravo, Rachel Z Blumhagen, Bruce A Edgar"
1902805,"Individual stripe regulatory elements in the Drosophila hairy promoter respond to maternal, gap, and pair-rule genes","Striped expression of the pair-rule gene hairy (h) plays a central role in regulating segmentation in Drosophila. We have used h-lacZ reporter gene fusions to delineate h sequences that drive individual stripe expression. We show that 14 kb of 5'-flanking DNA directs expression of seven lacZ stripes in the blastoderm embryo. Within this region, we identify discrete sequences required for expression of individual stripes 1, 5, 6, and 7, and dispersed elements active in the stripe 2 domain. Only the stripe 1 element directs lacZ expression in an accurate h stripe; stripes 5, 6, and 7 are displaced by one to two cells relative to their h counterparts. These results indicate that regulatory sequences are dispersed within the h promoter. We have determined the sensitivity of the lacZ stripes to maternal, gap, and pair-rule gene mutations. Our results suggest that different but overlapping subsets of gap genes regulate each stripe and that activation and repression are both important in generating the stripe pattern.",10.1101/gad.5.5.840,1991,"G Riddihough, D Ish-Horowicz"
16896687,Defective transfer of seminal-fluid materials during matings of semi-fertile fruitless mutants in Drosophila,"In context of the semi-sterility exhibited by Drosophila males expressing certain mating-enabling fruitless (fru) mutant genotypes, we examined the transfer of seminal fluid using a transgene that encodes the Sex Peptide (SP) oligopeptide fused to Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). We found that this fusion construct expresses SP-GFP in a valid manner within accessory glands of the male reproductive system in normal and fru-mutant males. Transfer of SP-GFP to live females was readily detectable during and after copulation. With respect to the pertinent combinations of fru mutations, we demonstrated that these abnormal genotypes cause males to transmit mating-related materials in two aberrant ways: one involving whether any seminal-fluid entities are transferred at all during a given mating; the other revealing an intriguing aspect of these fruitless effects, such that the mutations in question cause males to transfer female-affecting materials in a manner that varies among copulations. In this regard, certain mutant males that do not transfer SP nevertheless are able to transfer sperm: a fru-mated female possessing no GFP who was not fecund initially could produce progeny when seminal-fluid proteins were subsequently supplied by mating with a male that was spermless owing to the effects of a tudor mutation.",10.1007/s00359-006-0154-1,2006,"Adriana Villella, Jean-Baptiste Peyre, Toshiro Aigaki, Jeffrey C Hall"
17194628,Transcriptional regulation of the Drosophila melanogaster muscle myosin heavy-chain gene,"We show that a 2.6kb fragment of the muscle myosin heavy-chain gene (Mhc) of Drosophila melanogaster (containing 458 base pairs of upstream sequence, the first exon, the first intron and the beginning of the second exon) drives expression in all muscles. Comparison of the minimal promoter to Mhc genes of 10 Drosophila species identified putative regulatory elements in the upstream region and in the first intron. The first intron is required for expression in four small cells of the tergal depressor of the trochanter (jump) muscle and in the indirect flight muscle. The 3'-end of this intron is important for Mhc transcription in embryonic body wall muscle and contains AT-rich elements that are protected from DNase I digestion by nuclear proteins of Drosophila embryos. Sequences responsible for expression in embryonic, adult body wall and adult head muscles are present both within and outside the intron. Elements important for expression in leg muscles and in the large cells of the jump muscle flank the intron. We conclude that multiple transcriptional regulatory elements are responsible for Mhc expression in specific sets of Drosophila muscles.",10.1016/j.modgep.2006.11.007,2007,"Norbert K Hess, Phillip A Singer, Kien Trinh, Massoud Nikkhoy, Sanford I Bernstein"

We examined rpr expression during ectopic cell deaths caused by ionizing radiation or aberrant development. In both instances, dramatic induction of rpr expression was observed. A genomic fragment upstream of rpr confers this regulatory behavior upon a lacZ reporter transgene. In a model cell culture system, conditional expression of REAPER is sufficient to induce massive apoptosis that can be prevented by the anti-apoptotic protein p35. Overall, these results suggest that diverse signals converge at, or upstream of, rpr-associated transcriptional regulatory elements that can function to initiate a common apoptotic pathway involving ICE-like protease activity.",10.1006/dbio.1996.0296,1996,"W Nordstrom, P Chen, H Steller, J M Abrams"
24067530,The coiled-coil domain containing protein CCDC151 is required for the function of IFT-dependent motile cilia in animals,"Cilia are evolutionarily conserved organelles endowed with essential physiological and developmental functions. In humans, disruption of cilia motility or signaling leads to complex pleiotropic genetic disorders called ciliopathies. Cilia motility requires the assembly of multi-subunit motile components such as dynein arms, but mechanisms underlying their assembly pathway and transport into the axoneme are still largely unknown. We identified a previously uncharacterized coiled-coil domain containing protein CCDC151, which is evolutionarily conserved in motile ciliated species and shares ancient features with the outer dynein arm-docking complex 2 of Chlamydomonas. In Drosophila, we show that CG14127/CCDC151 is associated with motile intraflagellar transport (IFT)-dependent cilia and required for geotaxis behavior of adult flies. In zebrafish, Ccdc151 is expressed in tissues with motile cilia, and morpholino-induced depletion of Ccdc151 leads to left-right asymmetry defects and kidney cysts. We demonstrate that Ccdc151 is required for proper motile function of cilia in the Kupffer's vesicle and in the pronephros by controlling dynein arm assembly, showing that Ccdc151 is a novel player in the control of IFT-dependent dynein arm assembly in animals. However, we observed that CCDC151 is also implicated in other cellular functions in vertebrates. In zebrafish, ccdc151 is involved in proper orientation of cell divisions in the pronephros and genetically interacts with prickle1 in this process. Furthermore, knockdown experiments in mammalian cells demonstrate that CCDC151 is implicated in the regulation of primary cilium length. Hence, CCDC151 is required for motile cilia function in animals but has acquired additional non-motile functions in vertebrates.",10.1093/hmg/ddt445,2014,"Julie Jerber, Dominique Baas, Fabien Soulavie, Brigitte Chhin, Elisabeth Cortier, Christine Vesque, Joëlle Thomas, Bénédicte Durand"
19641625,Characterization of a lamellocyte transcriptional enhancer located within the misshapen gene of Drosophila melanogaster,"Drosophila has emerged as an excellent model system in which to study cellular and genetic aspects of hematopoiesis. Under normal developmental conditions and in wild-type genetic backgrounds, Drosophila possesses two types of blood cells, crystal cells and plasmatocytes. Upon infestation by a parasitic wasp or in certain altered genetic backgrounds, a third hemocyte class called the lamellocyte becomes apparent. Herein we describe the characterization of a novel transcriptional regulatory module, a lamellocyte-active enhancer of the misshapen gene. This transcriptional control sequence appears to be inactive in all cell types of the wild-type larva, including crystal cells and plasmatocytes. However, in lamellocytes induced by wasp infestation or by particular genetic conditions, the enhancer is activated and it directs reporter GFP or DsRed expression exclusively in lamellocytes. The lamellocyte control region was delimited to a 140-bp intronic sequence that contains an essential DNA recognition element for the AP-1 transcription factor. Additionally, mutation of the kayak gene encoding the dFos subunit of AP-1 led to a strong suppression of lamellocyte production in tumorous larvae. As misshapen encodes a protein kinase within the Jun N-terminal kinase signaling pathway that functions to form an active AP-1 complex, the lamellocyte-active enhancer likely serves as a transcriptional target within a genetic auto-regulatory circuit that promotes the production of lamellocytes in immune-challenged or genetically-compromised animals.",10.1371/journal.pone.0006429,2009,"Tsuyoshi Tokusumi, Richard Paul Sorrentino, Mark Russell, Roberto Ferrarese, Shubha Govind, Robert A Schulz"
16733548,Expression-guided in silico evaluation of candidate cis regulatory codes for Drosophila muscle founder cells,"While combinatorial models of transcriptional regulation can be inferred for metazoan systems from a priori biological knowledge, validation requires extensive and time-consuming experimental work. Thus, there is a need for computational methods that can evaluate hypothesized cis regulatory codes before the difficult task of experimental verification is undertaken. We have developed a novel computational framework (termed ""CodeFinder"") that integrates transcription factor binding site and gene expression information to evaluate whether a hypothesized transcriptional regulatory model (TRM; i.e., a set of co-regulating transcription factors) is likely to target a given set of co-expressed genes. Our basic approach is to simultaneously predict cis regulatory modules (CRMs) associated with a given gene set and quantify the enrichment for combinatorial subsets of transcription factor binding site motifs comprising the hypothesized TRM within these predicted CRMs. As a model system, we have examined a TRM experimentally demonstrated to drive the expression of two genes in a sub-population of cells in the developing Drosophila mesoderm, the somatic muscle founder cells. This TRM was previously hypothesized to be a general mode of regulation for genes expressed in this cell population. In contrast, the present analyses suggest that a modified form of this cis regulatory code applies to only a subset of founder cell genes, those whose gene expression responds to specific genetic perturbations in a similar manner to the gene on which the original model was based. We have confirmed this hypothesis by experimentally discovering six (out of 12 tested) new CRMs driving expression in the embryonic mesoderm, four of which drive expression in founder cells.",10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020053,2006,"Anthony A Philippakis, Brian W Busser, Stephen S Gisselbrecht, Fangxue Sherry He, Beatriz Estrada, Alan M Michelson, Martha L Bulyk"
20376353,A pair of dopamine neurons target the D1-like dopamine receptor DopR in the central complex to promote ethanol-stimulated locomotion in Drosophila,"Dopamine is a mediator of the stimulant properties of drugs of abuse, including ethanol, in mammals and in the fruit fly Drosophila. The neural substrates for the stimulant actions of ethanol in flies are not known. We show that a subset of dopamine neurons and their targets, through the action of the D1-like dopamine receptor DopR, promote locomotor activation in response to acute ethanol exposure. A bilateral pair of dopaminergic neurons in the fly brain mediates the enhanced locomotor activity induced by ethanol exposure, and promotes locomotion when directly activated. These neurons project to the central complex ellipsoid body, a structure implicated in regulating motor behaviors. Ellipsoid body neurons are required for ethanol-induced locomotor activity and they express DopR. Elimination of DopR blunts the locomotor activating effects of ethanol, and this behavior can be restored by selective expression of DopR in the ellipsoid body. These data tie the activity of defined dopamine neurons to D1-like DopR-expressing neurons to form a neural circuit that governs acute responding to ethanol.",10.1371/journal.pone.0009954,2010,"Eric C Kong, Katherine Woo, Haiyan Li, Tim Lebestky, Nasima Mayer, Melissa R Sniffen, Ulrike Heberlein, Roland J Bainton, Jay Hirsh, Fred W Wolf"
10498687,The role of the NK-homeobox gene slouch (S59) in somatic muscle patterning,"In the Drosophila embryo, a distinct class of myoblasts, designated as muscle founders, prefigures the mature pattern of somatic body wall muscles. Each founder cell appears to be instrumental in generating a single larval muscle with a defined identity. The NK homeobox gene S59 was the first of a growing number of proposed 'identity genes' that have been found to be expressed in stereotyped patterns in specific subsets of muscle founders and their progenitor cells and are thought to control their developmental fates. In the present study, we describe the effects of gain- and loss-of-function experiments with S59. We find that a null mutation in the gene encoding S59, which we have named slouch (slou), disrupts the development of all muscles that are derived from S59-expressing founder cells. The observed phenotypes upon mutation and ectopic expression of slouch include transformations of founder cell fates, thus confirming that slouch (S59) functions as an identity gene in muscle development. These fate transformations occur between sibling founder cells as well as between neighboring founders that are not lineage-related. In the latter case, we show that slouch (S59) activity is required cell-autonomously to repress the expression of ladybird (lb) homeobox genes, thereby preventing specification along the lb pathway. Together, these findings provide new insights into the regulatory interactions that establish the somatic muscle pattern.",,1999,"S Knirr, N Azpiazu, M Frasch"
27397649,Target genes of Dpp/BMP signaling pathway revealed by transcriptome profiling in the early D.melanogaster embryo,"In the early Drosophila melanogaster embryo, the gene regulatory network controlled by Dpp signaling is involved in the subdivision of dorsal ectoderm into the presumptive dorsal epidermis and amnioserosa. In this work, we aimed to identify new Dpp downstream targets involved in dorsal ectoderm patterning. We used oligonucleotide D. melanogaster microarrays to identify the set of genes that are differential expressed between wild type embryos and embryos that overexpress Dpp (nos-Gal4>UAS-dpp) during early stages of embryo development. By using this approach, we identified 358 genes whose relative abundance significantly increased in response to Dpp overexpression. Among them, we found the entire set of known Dpp target genes that function in dorsal ectoderm patterning (zen, doc, hnt, pnr, ush, tup, and others) in addition to several up-regulated genes of unknown functions. Spatial expression pattern of up-regulated genes in response to Dpp overexpression as well as their opposing transcriptional responses to Dpp loss- and gain-of-function indicated that they are new candidate target genes of Dpp signaling pathway. We further analyse one of the candidate genes, CG13653, which is expressed at the dorsal-most cells of the embryo during a restricted period of time. CG13653 orthologs were not detected in basal lineages of Dipterans, which unlike D. melanogaster develop two extra-embryonic membranes, amnion and serosa. We characterized the enhancer region of CG13653 and revealed that CG13653 is directly regulated by Dpp signaling pathway.",10.1016/j.gene.2016.07.015,2016,"Calixto Dominguez, Alejandro Zuñiga, Patricia Hanna, Christian Hodar, Mauricio Gonzalez, Verónica Cambiazo"
14523229,Drosophila Gr5a encodes a taste receptor tuned to trehalose,"Recent studies have suggested that Drosophila taste receptors are encoded by a family of G protein-coupled receptor genes comprising at least 56 members. One of these genes, Gr5a, has been shown by genetic analysis to be required by the fly for behavioral and sensory responses to a sugar, trehalose. Here, we show that Gr5a is expressed in neurons of taste sensilla located on the labellum and legs. Expression is observed in most if not all labellar sensilla and suggests that many taste neurons express more than one receptor. We demonstrate by heterologous expression in a Drosophila S2 cell line that Gr5a encodes a receptor tuned to trehalose. This is the first functional expression of an invertebrate taste receptor.",10.1073/pnas.2135339100,2003,"Sylwester Chyb, Anupama Dahanukar, Andrew Wickens, John R Carlson"
18395996,Caffeine induction of Cyp6a2 and Cyp6a8 genes of Drosophila melanogaster is modulated by cAMP and D-JUN protein levels,"Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases or CYPs, a family of endobiotics and xenobiotics metabolizing enzymes, are found in all organisms. We reported earlier that the promoters of Drosophila Cyp6a2 and Cyp6a8 genes are induced by caffeine. Since caffeine antagonizes adenosine receptor (AdoR) and inhibits cAMP phosphodiesterase (PDE), we used luciferase reporter gene to examine whether in SL-2 cells and adult Drosophila, induction of the two Cyp6 genes is mediated via AdoR and/or PDE pathway. Results showed that AdoR is not involved because AdoR agonists or antagonists do not affect the Cyp6 promoter activities. However, inhibition of PDE by specific inhibitors including caffeine causes induction of both Cyp6 gene promoters. We also found that flies mutant for dunce gene coding for cAMP-PDE, have higher Cyp6a8 promoter activity than the wild-type flies. We demonstrate that caffeine treatment increases intracellular cAMP levels, and cAMP treatment induces the Cyp6 gene promoters. Since both Cyp6 genes have multiple sites for JUN transcription factors, which generally play a positive role in cAMP pathway, effect of Drosophila jun (D-jun) on the Cyp6a8 promoter activity was examined. Results showed that the expression of D-jun sense plasmid causes downregulation rather than activation of the Cyp6a8 promoter. Conversely, expression of antisense plasmid increased the promoter activity. Interestingly, caffeine treatment decreased the D-JUN protein level in SL-2 cells as well as in adult flies. These results suggest that D-jun acts as a negative regulator, and caffeine induction of Cyp6a8 and Cyp6a2 genes is mediated by the upregulation of cAMP pathway and downregulation of the D-JUN protein level.",10.1016/j.gene.2008.02.017,2008,"Srividya Bhaskara, Mahesh B Chandrasekharan, Ranjan Ganguly"
31447264,Altering the Temporal Regulation of One Transcription Factor Drives Evolutionary Trade-Offs between Head Sensory Organs,"Size trade-offs of visual versus olfactory organs is a pervasive feature of animal evolution. This could result from genetic or functional constraints. We demonstrate that head sensory organ size trade-offs in Drosophila are genetically encoded and arise through differential subdivision of the head primordium into visual versus non-visual fields. We discover that changes in the temporal regulation of the highly conserved eyeless/Pax6 gene expression during development is a conserved mechanism for sensory trade-offs within and between Drosophila species. We identify a natural single nucleotide polymorphism in the cis-regulatory region of eyeless in a binding site of its repressor Cut that is sufficient to alter its temporal regulation and eye size. Because eyeless/Pax6 is a conserved regulator of head sensory placode subdivision, we propose that its temporal regulation is key to define the relative size of head sensory organs.",10.1016/j.devcel.2019.07.027,2019,"Ariane Ramaekers, Annelies Claeys, Martin Kapun, Emmanuèle Mouchel-Vielh, Delphine Potier, Simon Weinberger, Nicola Grillenzoni, Delphine Dardalhon-Cuménal, Jiekun Yan, Reinhard Wolf, Thomas Flatt, Erich Buchner, Bassem A Hassan"
11516643,Spatially restricted expression of candidate taste receptors in the Drosophila gustatory system,"Background: Taste is an important sensory modality in most animals. In Drosophila, taste is perceived by gustatory neurons located in sensilla distributed on several different appendages throughout the body of the animal. Here we show that the gustatory receptors are encoded by a family of at least 54 genes (Gr genes), most of which are expressed exclusively in a small subset of taste sensilla located in narrowly defined regions of the fly's body. Results: BLAST searches with the predicted amino acid sequences of 6 7-transmembrane-receptor genes of unknown function and 20 previously identified, putative gustatory receptor genes led to the identification of a large gene family comprising at least 54 genes. We investigated the expression of eight genes by using a Gal4 reporter gene assay and found that five of them were expressed in the gustatory system of the fly. Four genes were expressed in 1%-4% of taste sensilla, located in well-defined regions of the proboscis, the legs, or both. The fifth gene was expressed in about 20% of taste sensilla in all major gustatory organs, including the taste bristles on the anterior wing margin. Axon-tracing experiments demonstrated that neurons expressing a given Gr gene project their axons to a spatially restricted domain of the subesophageal ganglion in the fly brain. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that each taste sensillum represents a discrete, functional unit expressing at least one Gr receptor and that most Gr genes are expressed in spatially restricted domains of the gustatory system. These observations imply the potential for high taste discrimination of the Drosophila brain.",10.1016/s0960-9822(01)00258-5,2001,"L Dunipace, S Meister, C McNealy, H Amrein"
26092939,"Mitf is a master regulator of the v-ATPase, forming a control module for cellular homeostasis with v-ATPase and TORC1","The v-ATPase is a fundamental eukaryotic enzyme that is central to cellular homeostasis. Although its impact on key metabolic regulators such as TORC1 is well documented, our knowledge of mechanisms that regulate v-ATPase activity is limited. Here, we report that the Drosophila transcription factor Mitf is a master regulator of this holoenzyme. Mitf directly controls transcription of all 15 v-ATPase components through M-box cis-sites and this coordinated regulation affects holoenzyme activity in vivo. In addition, through the v-ATPase, Mitf promotes the activity of TORC1, which in turn negatively regulates Mitf. We provide evidence that Mitf, v-ATPase and TORC1 form a negative regulatory loop that maintains each of these important metabolic regulators in relative balance. Interestingly, direct regulation of v-ATPase genes by human MITF also occurs in cells of the melanocytic lineage, showing mechanistic conservation in the regulation of the v-ATPase by MITF family proteins in fly and mammals. Collectively, this evidence points to an ancient module comprising Mitf, v-ATPase and TORC1 that serves as a dynamic modulator of metabolism for cellular homeostasis.",10.1242/jcs.173807,2015,"Tianyi Zhang, Qingxiang Zhou, Margret Helga Ogmundsdottir, Katrin Möller, Robert Siddaway, Lionel Larue, Michael Hsing, Sek Won Kong, Colin Ronald Goding, Arnar Palsson, Eirikur Steingrimsson, Francesca Pignoni"
11166182,A model Notch response element detects Suppressor of Hairless-dependent molecular switch,"Cell-cell signaling mediated by Notch is critical during many different developmental processes for the specification or restriction of cell fates. Currently, the only known transduction pathway involves a DNA binding protein, Suppressor of Hairless [Su(H)] in Drosophila and CBF1 in mammals, and results in the direct activation of target genes. It has been proposed that in the absence of Notch, Su(H)/CBF1 acts as a repressor and is converted into an activator through interactions with the Notch intracellular domain [1--4]. Recently, we have also suggested that the activation of specific target genes requires synergy between Su(H) and other transcriptional activators [5]. Here we have designed an assay that allows us to directly test these hypotheses in vivo. Our results clearly demonstrate that Su(H) is able to function as the core of a molecular switch, repressing transcription in the absence of Notch and activating in the presence of Notch. In its capacity as an activator, Su(H) can cooperate synergistically with a DNA-bound transcription factor, Grainyhead. These interactions indicate a simple model for Notch target-gene regulation that could explain the precision of gene activation elicited by Notch signaling in different developmental fate decisions.",10.1016/s0960-9822(00)00044-0,2001,"M Furriols, S Bray"
2504583,A 14 bp promoter element directs the testis specificity of the Drosophila beta 2 tubulin gene,"To analyze the regulation of gene expression during male germ cell development, we investigated the testis-specific expression of the Drosophila beta 2 tubulin gene. Germ line transformation experiments with the upstream region of the D.melanogaster beta 2 tubulin gene fused to the Escherichia coli lacZ gene resulted in the correct tissue specific expression of the reporter gene. Furthermore, we showed that the upstream sequences of the beta 2 tubulin gene of the distantly related species D.hydei can drive the expression of the lacZ gene testis specifically in D.melanogaster flies. A detailed deletion analysis showed that 53 bp of upstream and 23 bp (D.melanogaster) or 29 bp (D.hydei) of leader sequences are sufficient to confer tissue specificity. The short promoter regions contain a 14 bp motif at identical positions in both species, which acts as a position-dependent promoter element.

Within these feedback loops, CLK and CYCLE (CYC) activate per and tim transcription at the same time as they repress Clk transcription, thus controlling the opposite cycling phases of these transcripts. CLK-CYC directly bind E box elements to activate transcription, but the mechanism of CLK-CYC-dependent repression is not known. Here we show that a CLK-CYC-activated gene, vrille (vri), encodes a repressor of Clk transcription, thereby identifying vri as a key negative component of the Clk feedback loop in Drosophila's circadian oscillator. The blue light photoreceptor encoding cryptochrome (cry) gene is also a target for VRI repression, suggesting a broader role for VRI in the rhythmic repression of output genes that cycle in phase with Clk.",10.1016/s0896-6273(03)00002-3,2003,"Nicholas R J Glossop, Jerry H Houl, Hao Zheng, Fanny S Ng, Scott M Dudek, Paul E Hardin"

The odor of the ripe fruit of M. citrifolia originates from hexanoic and octanoic acid. D. sechellia is attracted to these two fatty acids, whereas the other species in the complex are repelled. Here, using interspecies hybrids between D. melanogaster deficiency mutants and D. sechellia, we showed that the Odorant-binding protein 57e (Obp57e) gene is involved in the behavioral difference between the species. D. melanogaster knock-out flies for Obp57e and Obp57d showed altered behavioral responses to hexanoic acid and octanoic acid. Furthermore, the introduction of Obp57d and Obp57e from D. simulans and D. sechellia shifted the oviposition site preference of D. melanogaster Obp57d/e(KO) flies to that of the original species, confirming the contribution of these genes to D. sechellia's specialization to M. citrifolia.

E proteins and Id proteins also function to inhibit or promote cell proliferation and cancer. Using a genetic modifier screen in Drosophila, we show that the Id protein Extramacrochaetae enables growth by suppressing activation of the Salvador-Warts-Hippo pathway of tumor suppressors, activation that requires transcriptional activation of the expanded gene by the E protein Daughterless. Daughterless protein binds to an intronic enhancer in the expanded gene, both activating the SWH pathway independently of the transmembrane protein Crumbs and bypassing the negative feedback regulation that targets the same expanded enhancer. Thus, the Salvador-Warts-Hippo pathway has a cell-autonomous function to prevent inappropriate differentiation due to transcription factor imbalance and monitors the intrinsic developmental status of progenitor cells, distinct from any responses to cell-cell interactions.",10.1016/j.devcel.2014.12.002,2015,"Lan-Hsin Wang, Nicholas E Baker"
19036798,The origins of the Drosophila leg revealed by the cis-regulatory architecture of the Distalless gene,"Limb development requires the elaboration of a proximodistal (PD) axis, which forms orthogonally to previously defined dorsoventral (DV) and anteroposterior (AP) axes. In arthropods, the PD axis of the adult leg is subdivided into two broad domains, a proximal coxopodite and a distal telopodite. We show that the progressive subdivision of the PD axis into these two domains occurs during embryogenesis and is reflected in the cis-regulatory architecture of the Distalless (Dll) gene. Early Dll expression, governed by the Dll304 enhancer, is in cells that can give rise to both domains of the leg as well as to the entire dorsal (wing) appendage. A few hours after Dll304 is activated, the activity of this enhancer fades, and two later-acting enhancers assume control over Dll expression. The LT enhancer is expressed in cells that will give rise to the entire telopodite, and only the telopodite. By contrast, cells that activate the DKO enhancer will give rise to a leg-associated larval sensory structure known as the Keilin's organ (KO). Cells that activate neither LT nor DKO, but had activated Dll304, will give rise to the coxopodite. In addition, we describe the trans-acting signals controlling the LT and DKO enhancers, and show, surprisingly, that the coxopodite progenitors begin to proliferate approximately 24 hours earlier than the telopodite progenitors. Together, these findings provide a complete and high-resolution fate map of the Drosophila appendage primordia, linking the primary domains to specific cis-regulatory elements in Dll.",10.1242/dev.029975,2009,"Daniel J McKay, Carlos Estella, Richard S Mann"
23122844,Precision of hunchback expression in the Drosophila embryo,"Activation of the gap gene hunchback (hb) by the maternal Bicoid gradient is one of the most intensively studied gene regulatory interactions in animal development. Most efforts to understand this process have focused on the classical Bicoid target enhancer located immediately upstream of the P2 promoter. However, hb is also regulated by a recently identified distal shadow enhancer as well as a neglected ""stripe"" enhancer, which mediates expression in both central and posterior regions of cellularizing embryos. Here, we employ BAC transgenesis and quantitative imaging methods to investigate the individual contributions of these different enhancers to the dynamic hb expression pattern. These studies reveal that the stripe enhancer is crucial for establishing the definitive border of the anterior Hb expression pattern, just beyond the initial border delineated by Bicoid. Removal of this enhancer impairs dynamic expansion of hb expression and results in variable cuticular defects in the mesothorax (T2) due to abnormal patterns of segmentation gene expression. The stripe enhancer is subject to extensive regulation by gap repressors, including Kruppel, Knirps, and Hb itself. We propose that this repression helps ensure precision of the anterior Hb border in response to variations in the Bicoid gradient.",10.1016/j.cub.2012.09.051,2012,"Michael W Perry, Jacques P Bothma, Ryan D Luu, Michael Levine"
16139208,"Molecular, anatomical, and functional organization of the Drosophila olfactory system","Background: Olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) convey chemical information into the brain, producing internal representations of odors detected in the periphery. A comprehensive understanding of the molecular and neural mechanisms of odor detection and processing requires complete maps of odorant receptor (Or) expression and ORN connectivity, preferably at single-cell resolution. Results: We have constructed near-complete maps of Or expression and ORN targeting in the Drosophila olfactory system. These maps confirm the general validity of the ""one neuron--one receptor"" and ""one glomerulus--one receptor"" principles and reveal several additional features of olfactory organization. ORNs in distinct sensilla types project to distinct regions of the antennal lobe, but neighbor relations are not preserved. ORNs grouped in the same sensilla do not express similar receptors, but similar receptors tend to map to closely appositioned glomeruli in the antennal lobe. This organization may serve to ensure that odor representations are dispersed in the periphery but clustered centrally. Integrated with electrophysiological data, these maps also predict glomerular representations of specific odorants. Representations of aliphatic and aromatic compounds are spatially segregated, with those of aliphatic compounds arranged topographically according to carbon chain length. Conclusions: These Or expression and ORN connectivity maps provide further insight into the molecular, anatomical, and functional organization of the Drosophila olfactory system. Our maps also provide an essential resource for investigating how internal odor representations are generated and how they are further processed and transmitted to higher brain centers.",10.1016/j.cub.2005.07.034,2005,"Africa Couto, Mattias Alenius, Barry J Dickson"
25754646,Alternative mechanisms for talin to mediate integrin function,"Cell-matrix adhesion is essential for building animals, promoting tissue cohesion, and enabling cells to migrate and resist mechanical force. Talin is an intracellular protein that is critical for linking integrin extracellular-matrix receptors to the actin cytoskeleton. A key question raised by structure-function studies is whether talin, which is critical for all integrin-mediated adhesion, acts in the same way in every context. We show that distinct combinations of talin domains are required for each of three different integrin functions during Drosophila development. The partial function of some mutant talins requires vinculin, indicating that recruitment of vinculin allows talin to duplicate its own activities. The different requirements are best explained by alternative mechanisms of talin function, with talin using one or both of its integrin-binding sites. We confirmed these alternatives by showing that the proximity between the second integrin-binding site and integrins differs, suggesting that talin adopts different orientations relative to integrins. Finally, we show that vinculin and actomyosin activity help change talin's orientation. These findings demonstrate that the mechanism of talin function differs in each developmental context examined. The different arrangements of the talin molecule relative to integrins suggest that talin is able to sense different force vectors, either parallel or perpendicular to the membrane. This provides a paradigm for proteins whose apparent uniform function is in fact achieved by a variety of distinct mechanisms involving different molecular architectures.",10.1016/j.cub.2015.01.043,2015,"Benjamin Klapholz, Samantha L Herbert, Jutta Wellmann, Robert Johnson, Maddy Parsons, Nicholas H Brown"

However, the molecular mediators that might link hematopoiesis and cardiogenesis remain unknown. Here, we show that the highly conserved basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor Hand is expressed in cardioblasts, pericardial nephrocytes and hematopoietic progenitors. The homeodomain protein Tinman and the GATA factors Pannier and Serpent directly activate Hand in these cell types through a minimal enhancer, which is necessary and sufficient to drive Hand expression in these different cell types. Hand is activated by Tinman and Pannier in cardioblasts and pericardial nephrocytes, and by Serpent in hematopoietic progenitors in the lymph gland. These findings place Hand at a nexus of the transcriptional networks that govern cardiogenesis and hematopoiesis, and indicate that the transcriptional pathways involved in development of the cardiovascular, excretory and hematopoietic systems may be more closely related than previously appreciated.",10.1242/dev.01899,2005,"Zhe Han, Eric N Olson"

To identify elements in the tll promoter that respond to these different maternal systems, we have generated promoter-lacZ fusions and transformed them into the germline. Expression of these constructs in both wild type and mutant embryos revealed the presence of at least two separate but synergistically interacting regions that mediate tll expression by the terminal system. This functional synergism between regulatory elements may play a role in the translation of the torso (tor) morphogen gradient into the sharp boundary of tll gene activity. In addition to regions mediating activation by the terminal system, regions mediating both activation and repression by bicoid (bcd), and repression by dorsal (dl) were identified.

We have carried out a genetic screening, taking advantage of the rough eye phenotype of transgenic flies that express full-length DREF in the eye imaginal discs and identified the eukaryotic initiation factor 4A (eIF4A) gene as a dominant suppressor of the DREF-induced rough eye phenotype. The eIF4A gene was here found to carry three DRE sequences, DRE1 (-40 to -47), DRE2 (-48 to -55), and DRE3 (-267 to -274) in its promoter region, these all being important for the eIF4A gene promoter activity in cultured Drosophila Kc cells and in living flies. Knockdown of DREF in Drosophila S2 cells decreased the eIF4A mRNA level and the eIF4A gene promoter activity. Furthermore, specific binding of DREF to genomic regions containing DRE sequences was demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays using anti-DREF antibodies. Band mobility shift assays using Kc cell nuclear extracts revealed that DREF could bind to DRE1 and DRE3 sequences in the eIF4A gene promoter in vitro, but not to the DRE2 sequence. The results suggest that the eIF4A gene is under the control of the DREF pathway and DREF is therefore involved in the regulation of protein synthesis.",10.1016/j.yexcr.2007.08.016,2007,"Hiroyuki Ida, Hideki Yoshida, Kumi Nakamura, Masamitsu Yamaguchi"

We have targeted a genetically encoded optical reporter of synaptic transmission to each of these classes of neurons and visualized population responses to natural odors. The activation of an odor-specific ensemble of olfactory receptor neurons leads to the activation of a symmetric ensemble of projection neurons across the glomerular synaptic relay. Virtually all excited glomeruli receive inhibitory input from local interneurons.

29976765,Gene Regulatory Variation in Drosophila melanogaster Renal Tissue,"Genetic variation influencing levels of gene expression is abundant in natural populations, and may exert its effects through complex mechanisms that depend on an organism's genetic background and the tissue in which expression is measured. We investigated natural variation in gene expression in the Malpighian tubules of three inbred Drosophila melanogaster strains and their F1 hybrids. One of the strains was from a population in the species' ancestral range (Zambia), while the other two were from a more recently derived population (Sweden). Although closely related, the two Swedish strains differed greatly in terms of their expression inheritance when hybridized with the Zambian strain, with one Swedish strain showing a large excess of genes with recessive expression inheritance, as well as a large number of genes with overdominant inheritance. Although most expression variation could be attributed to trans-regulation, there were ∼200 genes that showed allele-specific expression differences in each of the between-population hybrids, indicating that cis-regulation contributes as well. The cis-regulated genes were enriched with cytochrome P450 genes, and the upstream regions of six of these genes were incorporated into transgenic reporter gene constructs to test their effects on expression. Differential expression was observed for five of the six reporter genes in the Malpighian tubule, suggesting that a large proportion of cis-regulatory variation lies directly upstream of the affected gene. In most cases, the differential expression was specific to the Malpighian tubule or greater in this tissue than in the rest of the body, highlighting the importance of single-tissue studies of gene expression variation.",10.1534/genetics.118.301073,2018,"Amanda Glaser-Schmitt, Aleksandra Zečić, John Parsch"

Experiments in Drosophila and zebrafish have revealed that ZGA depends on transcription factors that provide large-scale control of gene expression by direct and specific binding to gene regulatory sequences. Zelda (Zld) plays such a role in the Drosophila embryo, where it has been shown to control the action of patterning signals; however, the mechanisms underlying this effect remain largely unclear. A recent model proposed that Zld binding sites act as quantitative regulators of the spatiotemporal expression of genes activated by Dorsal (Dl), the morphogen that patterns the dorsoventral axis. Here we tested this model experimentally, using enhancers of brinker (brk) and short gastrulation (sog), both of which are directly activated by Dl, but at different concentration thresholds. In agreement with the model, we show that there is a clear positive correlation between the number of Zld binding sites and the spatial domain of enhancer activity. Likewise, the timing of expression could be advanced or delayed. We present evidence that Zld facilitates binding of Dl to regulatory DNA, and that this is associated with increased chromatin accessibility. Importantly, the change in chromatin accessibility is strongly correlated with the change in Zld binding, but not Dl. We propose that the ability of genome activators to facilitate readout of transcriptional input is key to widespread transcriptional induction during ZGA.",10.1016/j.cub.2014.04.032,2014,"Sun Melody Foo, Yujia Sun, Bomyi Lim, Ruta Ziukaite, Kevin O'Brien, Chung-Yi Nien, Nikolai Kirov, Stanislav Y Shvartsman, Christine A Rushlow"

In gain of function or loss of function experiments, we demonstrate that mod is directly controlled by dMyc. Strikingly, in proliferative imaginal cells, mod loss-of-function impairs both cell growth and cell size, whereas larval endoreplicative tissues grow normally. In contrast to dMyc, over-expressing Mod in wing imaginal discs is not sufficient to induce cell growth.

Here, we report the identification of several genes that are direct downstream targets of ac-sc activation, as judged by the following criteria. The genes are expressed in the PNCs of the wing imaginal disc in an ac-sc-dependent manner; the proximal promoter regions of all of these genes contain one or two high-affinity ac-sc binding sites, which define the novel consensus GCAGGTG(T/G)NNNYY; where tested, these binding sites are required in vivo for PNC expression of promoter-reporter fusion genes. Interestingly, these ac-sc target genes, including Bearded, Enhancer of split m7, Enhancer of split m8, and scabrous, are all known or believed to function in the selection of a single SOP from each PNC, a process mediated by inhibitory cell-cell interactions. Thus, one of the earliest steps in adult peripheral neurogenesis is the direct activation by proneural proteins of genes involved in restricting the expression of the SOP cell fate.",10.1101/gad.8.17.2058,1994,"A Singson, M W Leviten, A G Bang, X H Hua, J W Posakony"
15372035,Conserved mechanisms of glucose sensing and regulation by Drosophila corpora cardiaca cells,"Antagonistic activities of glucagon and insulin control metabolism in mammals, and disruption of this balance underlies diabetes pathogenesis. Insulin-producing cells (IPCs) in the brain of insects such as Drosophila also regulate serum glucose, but it remains unclear whether insulin is the sole hormonal regulator of glucose homeostasis and whether mechanisms of glucose-sensing and response in IPCs resemble those in pancreatic islets. Here we show, by targeted cell ablation, that Drosophila corpora cardiaca (CC) cells of the ring gland are also essential for larval glucose homeostasis. Unlike IPCs, CC cells express Drosophila cognates of sulphonylurea receptor (Sur) and potassium channel (Ir), proteins that comprise ATP-sensitive potassium channels regulating hormone secretion by islets and other mammalian glucose-sensing cells. They also produce adipokinetic hormone, a polypeptide with glucagon-like functions. Glucose regulation by CC cells is impaired by exposure to sulphonylureas, drugs that target the Sur subunit. Furthermore, ubiquitous expression of an akh transgene reverses the effect of CC ablation on serum glucose. Thus, Drosophila CC cells are crucial regulators of glucose homeostasis and they use glucose-sensing and response mechanisms similar to islet cells.",10.1038/nature02897,2004,"Seung K Kim, Eric J Rulifson"
20617173,Combinatorial binding leads to diverse regulatory responses: Lmd is a tissue-specific modulator of Mef2 activity,"Understanding how complex patterns of temporal and spatial expression are regulated is central to deciphering genetic programs that drive development. Gene expression is initiated through the action of transcription factors and their cofactors converging on enhancer elements leading to a defined activity. Specific constellations of combinatorial occupancy are therefore often conceptualized as rigid binding codes that give rise to a common output of spatio-temporal expression. Here, we assessed this assumption using the regulatory input of two essential transcription factors within the Drosophila myogenic network. Mutations in either Myocyte enhancing factor 2 (Mef2) or the zinc-finger transcription factor lame duck (lmd) lead to very similar defects in myoblast fusion, yet the underlying molecular mechanism for this shared phenotype is not understood. Using a combination of ChIP-on-chip analysis and expression profiling of loss-of-function mutants, we obtained a global view of the regulatory input of both factors during development. The majority of Lmd-bound enhancers are co-bound by Mef2, representing a subset of Mef2's transcriptional input during these stages of development. Systematic analyses of the regulatory contribution of both factors demonstrate diverse regulatory roles, despite their co-occupancy of shared enhancer elements. These results indicate that Lmd is a tissue-specific modulator of Mef2 activity, acting as both a transcriptional activator and repressor, which has important implications for myogenesis. More generally, this study demonstrates considerable flexibility in the regulatory output of two factors, leading to additive, cooperative, and repressive modes of co-regulation.",10.1371/journal.pgen.1001014,2010,"Paulo M F Cunha, Thomas Sandmann, E Hilary Gustafson, Lucia Ciglar, Michael P Eichenlaub, Eileen E M Furlong"
21220098,Functional architecture of olfactory ionotropic glutamate receptors,"Ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) are ligand-gated ion channels that mediate chemical communication between neurons at synapses. A variant iGluR subfamily, the Ionotropic Receptors (IRs), was recently proposed to detect environmental volatile chemicals in olfactory cilia. Here, we elucidate how these peripheral chemosensors have evolved mechanistically from their iGluR ancestors. Using a Drosophila model, we demonstrate that IRs act in combinations of up to three subunits, comprising individual odor-specific receptors and one or two broadly expressed coreceptors. Heteromeric IR complex formation is necessary and sufficient for trafficking to cilia and mediating odor-evoked electrophysiological responses in vivo and in vitro. IRs display heterogeneous ion conduction specificities related to their variable pore sequences, and divergent ligand-binding domains function in odor recognition and cilia localization. Our results provide insights into the conserved and distinct architecture of these olfactory and synaptic ion channels and offer perspectives into the use of IRs as genetically encoded chemical sensors.",10.1016/j.neuron.2010.11.042,2011,"Liliane Abuin, Benoîte Bargeton, Maximilian H Ulbrich, Ehud Y Isacoff, Stephan Kellenberger, Richard Benton"

We have identified enhancers that drive reporter expression in four distinct subtypes of embryonic neurons, all of which project axons in the anterior commissure of the developing nervous system. We also identified enhancers driving expression in the drl-expressing muscles and epidermal attachment cells. These enhancers define the classes of neurons projecting in the anterior commissure and can be used to precisely define axon pathfinding errors in drl and other mutants.",10.1016/s0925-4773(99)00007-6,1999,"J L Bonkowsky, J B Thomas"
22345563,Allatostatin-A neurons inhibit feeding behavior in adult Drosophila,"How the brain translates changes in internal metabolic state or perceived food quality into alterations in feeding behavior remains poorly understood. Studies in Drosophila larvae have yielded information about neuropeptides and circuits that promote feeding, but a peptidergic neuron subset whose activation inhibits feeding in adult flies, without promoting metabolic changes that mimic the state of satiety, has not been identified. Using genetically based manipulations of neuronal activity, we show that activation of neurons (or neuroendocrine cells) expressing the neuropeptide allatostatin A (AstA) inhibits or limits several starvation-induced changes in feeding behavior in adult Drosophila, including increased food intake and enhanced behavioral responsiveness to sugar. Importantly, these effects on feeding behavior are observed in the absence of any measurable effects on metabolism or energy reserves, suggesting that AstA neuron activation is likely a consequence, not a cause, of metabolic changes that induce the state of satiety. These data suggest that activation of AstA-expressing neurons promotes food aversion and/or exerts an inhibitory influence on the motivation to feed and implicate these neurons and their associated circuitry in the mechanisms that translate the state of satiety into alterations in feeding behavior.",10.1073/pnas.1200778109,2012,"Anne Christina Hergarden, Timothy D Tayler, David J Anderson"
7489720,The Drosophila fork head domain protein crocodile is required for the establishment of head structures,"The fork head (fkh) domain defines the DNA-binding region of a family of transcription factors which has been implicated in regulating cell fate decisions across species lines. We have cloned and molecularly characterized the crocodile (croc) gene which encodes a new family member from Drosophila. croc is expressed in the head anlagen of the blastoderm embryo under the control of the anterior, the dorsoventral and the terminal maternal organizer systems. The croc mutant phenotype indicates that the croc wild-type gene is required to function as an early patterning gene in the anterior-most blastoderm head segment anlage and for the establishment of a specific head skeletal structure that derives from the non-adjacent intercalary segment at a later stage of embryogenesis. As an early patterning gene, croc exerts unusual properties which do not allow it to be grouped among the established segmentation genes. A single-site mutation within the croc fkh domain, which causes a replacement of the first out of four conserved amino acid residues thought to be involved in the coordinate binding of Mg2+, abolishes the DNA binding of the protein in vitro. In view of the resulting lack-of-function mutant phenotype, it appears likely that metal binding by the affected region of the fkh domain is crucial for proper folding of the DNA-binding structure.",,1995,"U Häcker, E Kaufmann, C Hartmann, G Jürgens, W Knöchel, H Jäckle"
9431813,Transcriptional regulation of the Drosophila homeotic gene teashirt by the homeodomain protein Fushi tarazu,"The Drosophila melanogaster gene teashirt (tsh) is essential for segment identity of the embryonic thorax and abdomen. A deletion 3' to the tsh transcription unit causes the loss of tsh early expression in the even-numbered parasegments, and the corresponding larval cuticular patterns are disrupted. tsh function in the odd-numbered parasegments in these mutants is normal by both criteria. The in vivo activities of genomic fragments from the deleted region were tested in transgenic embryos. A 2.0 kb enhancer from the 3' region acts mainly in the even-numbered parasegments and is dependent on fushi tarazu (ftz) activity, which encodes a homeodomain protein required for the development of even-numbered parasegments. Ftz protein binds in vitro to four distinct sequences in a 220 bp sub-fragment; these and neighboring sequences are conserved in the equivalent enhancer isolated from Drosophila virilis. Tsh protein produced under the control of the 220 bp enhancer partially rescues a null tsh mutation, with its strongest effect in the even-numbered parasegments. Mutation of the Ftz binding sites partially abrogates the capacity for rescue. These results suggest a composite mechanism for regulation of tsh, with different activators such as ftz contributing to the overall pattern of expression of this key regulator.",10.1016/s0925-4773(97)00144-5,1997,"N Coré, B Charroux, A McCormick, C Vola, L Fasano, M P Scott, S Kerridge"
26975664,Integration of Orthogonal Signaling by the Notch and Dpp Pathways in Drosophila,"The transcription factor Suppressor of Hairless and its coactivator, the Notch intracellular domain, are polyglutamine (pQ)-rich factors that target enhancer elements and interact with other locally bound pQ-rich factors. To understand the functional repertoire of such enhancers, we identify conserved regulatory belts with binding sites for the pQ-rich effectors of both Notch and BMP/Dpp signaling, and the pQ-deficient tissue selectors Apterous (Ap), Scalloped (Sd), and Vestigial (Vg). We find that the densest such binding site cluster in the genome is located in the BMP-inducible nab locus, a homolog of the vertebrate transcriptional cofactors NAB1/NAB2 We report three major findings. First, we find that this nab regulatory belt is a novel enhancer driving dorsal wing margin expression in regions of peak phosphorylated Mad in wing imaginal discs. Second, we show that Ap is developmentally required to license the nab dorsal wing margin enhancer (DWME) to read out Notch and Dpp signaling in the dorsal compartment. Third, we find that the nab DWME is embedded in a complex of intronic enhancers, including a wing quadrant enhancer, a proximal wing disc enhancer, and a larval brain enhancer. This enhancer complex coordinates global nab expression via both tissue-specific activation and interenhancer silencing. We suggest that DWME integration of BMP signaling maintains nab expression in proliferating margin descendants that have divided away from Notch-Delta boundary signaling. As such, uniform expression of genes like nab and vestigial in proliferating compartments would typically require both boundary and nonboundary lineage-specific enhancers.",10.1534/genetics.116.186791,2016,"Elizabeth Stroebele, Albert Erives"
2571934,The caudal gene product is a direct activator of fushi tarazu transcription during Drosophila embryogenesis,"A drosophila pair-rule segmentation gene, fushi tarazu (ftz), encodes a protein which is expressed in a characteristic seven-stripe pattern. The promoter sequences that are sufficient for generating this spatially restricted pattern of expression are located within 669 base pairs upstream of the transcription start site. Multiple transcriptional activators and repressors interact with this 'zebra-stripe' promoter unit to bring about the positional specificity of ftz transcription. Here we report that the homoeodomain-containing protein encoded by caudal (cad) is one such regulator. The cad gene product can increase the level of ftz transcription in the posterior half of the embryo by interacting with multiple copies of a TTTATG consensus sequence located in the zebra-stripe unit. This result demonstrates one pathway by which the product of a maternally expressed segmentation gene, expressed in an antero-posterior concentration gradient, can directly regulate the expression of a pair-rule gene.",10.1038/341340a0,1989,"C R Dearolf, J Topol, C S Parker"

Different signals activate separate enhancers to control vestigial expression: first, in the dorsal/ventral organizer through the Notch pathway, and subsequently, in the developing wing blade by decapentaplegic and a signal from the dorsal/ventral organizer.

9584118,Eyeless initiates the expression of both sine oculis and eyes absent during Drosophila compound eye development,"The Drosophila Pax-6 gene eyeless acts high up in the genetic hierarchy involved in compound eye development and can direct the formation of extra eyes in ectopic locations. Here we identify sine oculis and eyes absent as two mediators of the eye-inducing activity of eyeless. We show that eyeless induces and requires the expression of both genes independently during extra eye development. During normal eye development, eyeless is expressed earlier than and is required for the expression of sine oculis and eyes absent, but not vice versa. Based on the results presented here and those of others, we propose a model in which eyeless induces the initial expression of both sine oculis and eyes absent in the eye disc. sine oculis and eyes absent then appear to participate in a positive feedback loop that regulates the expression of all three genes. In contrast to the regulatory interactions that occur in the developing eye disc, we also show that in the embryonic head, sine oculis acts in parallel to eyeless and twin of eyeless, a second Pax-6 gene from Drosophila. Recent studies in vertebrate systems indicate that the epistatic relationships among the corresponding vertebrate homologs are very similar to those observed in Drosophila.",,1998,"G Halder, P Callaerts, S Flister, U Walldorf, U Kloter, W J Gehring"
23555301,A novel function for the Hox gene Abd-B in the male accessory gland regulates the long-term female post-mating response in Drosophila,"In insects, products of the male reproductive tract are essential for initiating and maintaining the female post-mating response (PMR). The PMR includes changes in egg laying, receptivity to courting males, and sperm storage. In Drosophila, previous studies have determined that the main cells of the male accessory gland produce some of the products required for these processes. However, nothing was known about the contribution of the gland's other secretory cell type, the secondary cells. In the course of investigating the late functions of the homeotic gene, Abdominal-B (Abd-B), we discovered that Abd-B is specifically expressed in the secondary cells of the Drosophila male accessory gland. Using an Abd-B BAC reporter coupled with a collection of genetic deletions, we discovered an enhancer from the iab-6 regulatory domain that is responsible for Abd-B expression in these cells and that apparently works independently from the segmentally regulated chromatin domains of the bithorax complex. Removal of this enhancer results in visible morphological defects in the secondary cells. We determined that mates of iab-6 mutant males show defects in long-term egg laying and suppression of receptivity, and that products of the secondary cells are influential during sperm competition. Many of these phenotypes seem to be caused by a defect in the storage and gradual release of sex peptide in female mates of iab-6 mutant males. We also found that Abd-B expression in the secondary cells contributes to glycosylation of at least three accessory gland proteins: ovulin (Acp26Aa), CG1656, and CG1652. Our results demonstrate that long-term post-mating changes observed in mated females are not solely induced by main cell secretions, as previously believed, but that secondary cells also play an important role in male fertility by extending the female PMR. Overall, these discoveries provide new insights into how these two cell types cooperate to produce and maintain a robust female PMR.",10.1371/journal.pgen.1003395,2013,"Dragan Gligorov, Jessica L Sitnik, Robert K Maeda, Mariana F Wolfner, François Karch"
20060894,"Cell-specific inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate 3-kinase mediates epithelial cell apoptosis in response to oxidative stress in Drosophila","Organismal stress responses to oxidative stress are relevant to ageing and disease and involve key cell-/tissue-specific signal transduction mechanisms. Using Drosophila, an established in vivo model for stress studies, we show that cell-specific inositol phosphate signalling specifically via inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate 3-kinase (InsP(3) 3-K, IP(3)K), negatively regulates organismal responses to oxidative stress. We demonstrate that the Drosophila Malpighian tubule (equivalent to vertebrate kidney and liver) is a key epithelial sensor for organismal oxidative stress responses: precise targeting of either gain-of-function constructs of Drosophila IP(3)Ks (IP(3)K-1 and IP(3)K-2), or loss-of-function (RNAi) constructs to only one cell type in tubule reversibly modulates survival of stress-challenged adult flies. In vivo, targeted IP(3)K-1 directly increases H(2)O(2) production, pro-apoptotic caspase-9 activity and mitochondrial membrane potential. The mitochondrial calcium load in tubule principal cells-assessed by luminescent and fluorescent genetically-encoded mitochondrial calcium reporters-is significantly increased by IP(3)K-1 under oxidative stress conditions, leading to apoptosis. The Drosophila orthologues of human apoptotic bcl-2 genes include debcl and buffy. Oxidative stress challenge does not modulate gene expression of either debcl or buffy in tubules; and altered debcl expression does not influence survival rates under oxidative stress challenge. Finally, targeted over-expression of either debcl or buffy to tubule principal cells does not impact on tubule caspase-9 activity. Thus, IP(3)K-1 modulates epithelial cell apoptosis without involvement of bcl-2-type proteins.",10.1016/j.cellsig.2009.12.009,2010,"Selim Terhzaz, Andrew J Finlayson, Laura Stirrat, JingLi Yang, Herve Tricoire, Debra J Woods, Julian A T Dow, Shireen-A Davies"

It is not clear how brief, low-affinity interactions can drive efficient transcription. Here, we report that the transcription factor Ultrabithorax (Ubx) utilizes low-affinity binding sites in the Drosophila melanogaster shavenbaby (svb) locus and related enhancers in nuclear microenvironments of high Ubx concentrations. Related enhancers colocalize to the same microenvironments independently of their chromosomal location, suggesting that microenvironments are highly differentiated transcription domains. Manipulating the affinity of svb enhancers revealed an inverse relationship between enhancer affinity and Ubx concentration required for transcriptional activation. The Ubx cofactor, Homothorax (Hth), was co-enriched with Ubx near enhancers that require Hth, even though Ubx and Hth did not co-localize throughout the nucleus. Thus, microenvironments of high local transcription factor and cofactor concentrations could help low-affinity sites overcome their kinetic inefficiency. Mechanisms that generate these microenvironments could be a general feature of eukaryotic transcriptional regulation.",10.7554/eLife.28975,2017,"Albert Tsai, Anand K Muthusamy, Mariana Rp Alves, Luke D Lavis, Robert H Singer, David L Stern, Justin Crocker"

In Drosophila, MEF2 accumulates at high levels in the embryonic muscles, where it activates target genes throughout the mesoderm. Here, we identify the Transglutaminase gene (Tg; CG7356) as a direct transcriptional target of MEF2 in the cardiac musculature. Tg is expressed in cells forming the inflow tracts of the dorsal vessel, and we identify the enhancer responsible for this expression. The enhancer contains three binding sites for MEF2, and can be activated by MEF2 in tissue culture and in vivo. Moreover, loss of MEF2 function, or removal of the MEF2 binding sites from the enhancer, results in loss of Tg expression. These studies identify a new MEF2 target in the cardiac musculature.

7547478,Dual organisation of the Drosophila neuropeptide receptor NKD gene promoter,"Neuropeptide function in the peripheral and central nervous systems has been described in mammals as well as in insects. We previously reported the cloning of the neuropeptide receptor NKD, a Drosophila melanogaster homologue of the mammalian tachykinin receptors. This receptor is expressed during Drosophila embryonic development and in the adult fly. Use of the NKD promoter region to drive beta-galactosidase expression in transgenic flies reveals a bipartite promoter organisation: the distal region controls NKD expression in neurosecretory cells of the central nervous system during late embryogenesis, whereas the proximal region is responsible for transient expression in peripheral nervous system during late embryogenesis, whereas the proximal region is responsible for transient expression in peripheral nervous system precursor cells early in development. This early NKD expression, first restricted to the sensory organ precursor cell, an atonal positive cell, is abolished in the ato1 mutant. In addition, we show that the proneural protein atonal, in association with daughterless, transactivates the NKD promoter in Schneider S2 cells via the proximal E box NKDE2.

We compared conserved non-coding sequences (CNCSs) between five Drosophilids along the approximately 40 kb genomic locus of the RD gene dachshund (dac). Our analysis uncovers two separate eye enhancers in intron eight and the 3' non-coding regions of the dac locus defined by clusters of highly conserved sequences. Loss- and gain-of-function analyses suggest that the 3' eye enhancer is synergistically activated by a combination of eya, so and dpp signaling, and only indirectly activated by ey, whereas the 5' eye enhancer is primarily regulated by ey, acting in concert with eya and so.

How ato activates rho, and why it does so in only a limited number of sensory cells remains unclear. We previously identified a rho enhancer (RhoBAD) that is active within a subset of abdominal SOP cells to induce larval oenocytes and showed that RhoBAD is regulated by an Abdominal-A (Abd-A) Hox complex and the Senseless (Sens) transcription factor. Here, we show that ato is also required for proper RhoBAD activity and oenocyte formation. Transgenic reporter assays reveal RhoBAD contains two conserved regions that drive SOP gene expression: RhoD mediates low levels of expression in both thoracic and abdominal SOP cells, whereas RhoA drives strong expression within abdominal SOP cells. Ato indirectly stimulates both elements and enhances RhoA reporter activity by interfering with the ability of the Sens repressor to bind DNA.

7859741,Ultrabithorax protein is necessary but not sufficient for full activation of decapentaplegic expression in the visceral mesoderm,"To elucidate the mechanisms by which homeotic selector (HOM) genes specify the unique features of Drosophila segments, we have analyzed the regulation of decapentaplegic (dpp), a transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta superfamily member, and have found that the Ultrabithorax (Ubx) HOM protein directly activates dpp expression in parasegment 7 (PS7) of the embryonic visceral mesoderm. Other factors are also required, including one that appears to act through homeodomain protein binding sites and may be encoded by extradenticle (exd). The exd protein binds in a highly co-operative manner to regulatory sequences mediating PS7-specific dpp expression, consistent with a genetic requirement for exd function in normal visceral mesoderm expression of dpp. A second mechanism contributing to PS7 expression of dpp appears not to require Ubx protein directly, and involves a general visceral mesoderm enhancer coupled to a spatially specific repression element. Thus, even in an apparently simple case where visceral mesoderm expression of the dpp target gene mirrors that of the Ubx HOM protein, full activation by Ubx protein requires at least one additional factor. In addition, a distinct regulatory mode not directly involving Ubx protein also appears to contribute to PS7-specific expression.",,1995,"B Sun, D A Hursh, D Jackson, P A Beachy"

By systematic analysis of the DNA-binding specificity of so we identified the most important nucleotides for this interaction. Using the emerging consensus sequence for SO-DNA binding we performed a genome-wide search and have thereby been able to identify eyeless as well as the signalling gene hedgehog as putative targets of so.

23232763,Dissecting the mechanisms of Notch induced hyperplasia,"The outcome of the Notch pathway on proliferation depends on cellular context, being growth promotion in some, including several cancers, and growth inhibition in others. Such disparate outcomes are evident in Drosophila wing discs, where Notch overactivation causes hyperplasia despite having localized inhibitory effects on proliferation. To understand the underlying mechanisms, we have used genomic strategies to identify the Notch-CSL target genes directly activated during wing disc hyperplasia. Among them were genes involved in both autonomous and non-autonomous regulation of proliferation, growth and cell death, providing molecular explanations for many characteristics of Notch induced wing disc hyperplasia previously reported. The Notch targets exhibit different response patterns, which are shaped by both positive and negative feed-forward regulation between the Notch targets themselves. We propose, therefore, that both the characteristics of the direct Notch targets and their cross-regulatory relationships are important in coordinating the pattern of hyperplasia.",10.1038/emboj.2012.326,2013,"Alexandre Djiane, Alena Krejci, Frédéric Bernard, Silvie Fexova, Katherine Millen, Sarah J Bray"
12537575,Assessing the impact of comparative genomic sequence data on the functional annotation of the Drosophila genome,"Background: It is widely accepted that comparative sequence data can aid the functional annotation of genome sequences; however, the most informative species and features of genome evolution for comparison remain to be determined. Results: We analyzed conservation in eight genomic regions (apterous, even-skipped, fushi tarazu, twist, and Rhodopsins 1, 2, 3 and 4) from four Drosophila species (D. erecta, D. pseudoobscura, D. willistoni, and D. littoralis) covering more than 500 kb of the D. melanogaster genome. All D. melanogaster genes (and 78-82% of coding exons) identified in divergent species such as D. pseudoobscura show evidence of functional constraint. Addition of a third species can reveal functional constraint in otherwise non-significant pairwise exon comparisons. Microsynteny is largely conserved, with rearrangement breakpoints, novel transposable element insertions, and gene transpositions occurring in similar numbers. Rates of amino-acid substitution are higher in uncharacterized genes relative to genes that have previously been studied. Conserved non-coding sequences (CNCSs) tend to be spatially clustered with conserved spacing between CNCSs, and clusters of CNCSs can be used to predict enhancer sequences. Conclusions: Our results provide the basis for choosing species whose genome sequences would be most useful in aiding the functional annotation of coding and cis-regulatory sequences in Drosophila. Furthermore, this work shows how decoding the spatial organization of conserved sequences, such as the clustering of CNCSs, can complement efforts to annotate eukaryotic genomes on the basis of sequence conservation alone.",10.1186/gb-2002-3-12-research0086,2002,"Casey M Bergman, Barret D Pfeiffer, Diego E Rincón-Limas, Roger A Hoskins, Andreas Gnirke, Chris J Mungall, Adrienne M Wang, Brent Kronmiller, Joanne Pacleb, Soo Park, Mark Stapleton, Kenneth Wan, Reed A George, Pieter J de Jong, Juan Botas, Gerald M Rubin, Susan E Celniker"
12421707,The Drosophila Pox neuro gene: control of male courtship behavior and fertility as revealed by a complete dissection of all enhancers,"We have dissected the entire cis-regulatory region of the Drosophila Pox neuro gene with regard to its enhancers, and have analyzed their functions by the selective addition to Pox neuro null mutant flies of one or several functions, each regulated by a complete or partial enhancer. We have identified at least 15 enhancers with an astounding complexity in arrangement and substructure that regulate Pox neuro functions required for the development of the peripheral and central nervous system and of most appendages. Many of these functions are essential for normal male courtship behavior and fertility. Two enhancers regulate the development of the penis, claspers and posterior lobes of male genitalia. Three enhancers, two of which overlap, control the development of chemosensory bristles in the labellum, legs and wings, some or all of which are required for the transmission of gustatory signals elicited by female pheromones. An additional enhancer regulates in the developing brain the connectivity of two specific neuronal clusters entrusted with processing olfactory pheromone signals from the antennal nerve. Finally, functions crucial for the ability of the male to copulate depend on an enhancer that activates Pox neuro expression in the embryonic ventral cord. In addition to these male courtship and fertility functions of Pox neuro, we have identified enhancers that regulate: (1) proper segmentation of tarsal segments in the leg disc and in homologous segments of the antennal disc; and (2) proper development of the wing hinge and hence the ability of the fly to fly.",10.1242/dev.00157,2002,"Werner Boll, Markus Noll"
1309812,Genetic analysis of a Drosophila microtubule-associated protein,"The 205-kD microtubule-associated protein (205K MAP) is one of the principal MAPs in Drosophila. 205K MAP is similar to the HeLa 210K/MAP4 family of MAPs since it shares the following biochemical properties: it is present in several isoforms, has a molecular mass of approximately 200 kD, and is thermostable. Furthermore, immuno-crossreactivity has been observed between mouse MAP4, HeLa 210K, and Drosophila 205K MAP. Currently, there is little information concerning the biological function of this group of nonmotor MAPs. We have used a classical genetic approach to try to identify the role of the 205K MAP in Drosophila by isolating mutations in the 205K MAP gene. An F2 lethal screen was used to acquire deficiencies of 100EF, the chromosomal location of the 205K MAP gene. Drosophila bearing a homozygous deficiency for the 205K MAP region are fully viable and show no obvious phenotype. A recently developed polymerase chain reaction screen was also used to recover five P-element insertions upstream from the 205K MAP gene. Western blot analysis has shown that these insertions result in hypomorphic mutations of the 205K MAP gene. As was seen with animals that have no 205K MAP, these mutations appear to have no phenotype. These data unambiguously demonstrate that the 205K MAP gene is inessential for development. These results also suggest that there may exist protein(s) with redundant function that can substitute for 205K MAP.",10.1083/jcb.116.2.377,1992,"A Pereira, J Doshen, E Tanaka, L S Goldstein"
10673509,Repression by suppressor of hairless and activation by Notch are required to define a single row of single-minded expressing cells in the Drosophila embryo,"Notch signal transduction appears to involve the ligand-induced intracellular processing of Notch, and the formation of a processed Notch-Suppressor of Hairless complex that binds DNA and activates the transcription of Notch target genes. This suggests that loss of either Notch or Su(H) activities should lead to similar cell fate changes. However, previous data indicate that, in the Drosophila blastoderm embryo, mesectoderm specification requires Notch but not Su(H) activity. The determination of the mesectodermal fate is specified by Single-minded (Sim), a transcription factor expressed in a single row of cells abutting the mesoderm. The molecular mechanisms by which the dorsoventral gradient of nuclear Dorsal establishes the single-cell wide territory of sim expression are not fully understood. We have found that Notch activity is required for sim expression in cellularizing embryos. In contrast, at this stage, Su(H) has a dual function. Su(H) activity was required to up-regulate sim expression in the mesectoderm, and to prevent the ectopic expression of sim dorsally in the neuroectoderm. We have shown that repression of sim transcription by Su(H) is direct and independent of Notch activity. Conversely, activation of sim transcription by Notch requires the Su(H)-binding sites. Thus, Notch signalling appears to relieve the repression exerted by Su(H) and to up-regulate sim transcription in the mesectoderm. We propose a model in which repression by Su(H) and derepression by Notch are essential to allow for the definition of a single row of mesectodermal cells in the blastoderm embryo.",,2000,"V Morel, F Schweisguth"
1363542,"Connectin, a target of homeotic gene control in Drosophila","The homeotic genes of Drosophila encode transcription factors that specify morphological differences between segments. To identify the genes that they control, we developed a chromatin immunopurification approach designed to isolate in vivo binding sites for the products of the homeotic gene Ultrabithorax. Here, we report the analysis of one immunopurified binding site. This 110 bp fragment maps within a regulatory region of a gene under homeotic control, connectin. A 4 kb DNA fragment, including the immunopurified binding site, is sufficient to reproduce the appropriate homeotic control within a subset of the full tissue distribution of connectin. Analysis of the role of the 110 bp binding site indicates that it mediates transcriptional controls by Ultrabithorax and other homeotic genes. This is the first report of a functional in vivo binding site isolated using the chromatin immunopurification method. We also show that the protein product of the connectin gene is predicted to be a cell-surface molecule containing leucine-rich repeats. The protein, connectin, can mediate cell-cell adhesion thus suggesting a direct link between homeotic gene function and processes of cell-cell recognition.",,1992,"A P Gould, R A White"
31685844,Serpent/dGATAb regulates Laminin B1 and Laminin B2 expression during Drosophila embryogenesis,"Transcriptional regulation of Laminin expression during embryogenesis is a key step required for proper ECM assembly. We show, that in Drosophila the Laminin B1 and Laminin B2 genes share expression patterns in mesodermal cells as well as in endodermal and ectodermal gut primordia, yolk and amnioserosa. In the absence of the GATA transcription factor Serpent, the spatial extend of Laminin reporter gene expression was strongly limited, indicating that Laminin expression in many tissues depends on Serpent activity. We demonstrate a direct binding of Serpent to the intronic enhancers of Laminin B1 and Laminin B2. In addition, ectopically expressed Serpent activated enhancer elements of Laminin B1 and Laminin B2. Our results reveal Serpent as an important regulator of Laminin expression across tissues.",10.1038/s41598-019-52210-9,2019,"Uwe Töpfer, Maik C Bischoff, Marek Bartkuhn, Anne Holz"
17363250,Generalization of courtship learning in Drosophila is mediated by cis-vaccenyl acetate,"Reproductive behavior in Drosophila has both stereotyped and plastic components that are driven by age- and sex-specific chemical cues. Males who unsuccessfully court virgin females subsequently avoid females that are of the same age as the trainer. In contrast, males trained with mature mated females associate volatile appetitive and aversive pheromonal cues and learn to suppress courtship of all females. Here we show that the volatile aversive pheromone that leads to generalized learning with mated females is (Z)-11-octadecenyl acetate (cis-vaccenyl acetate, cVA). cVA is a major component of the male cuticular hydrocarbon profile, but it is not found on virgin females. During copulation, cVA is transferred to the female in ejaculate along with sperm and peptides that decrease her sexual receptivity. When males sense cVA (either synthetic or from mated female or male extracts) in the context of female pheromone, they develop a generalized suppression of courtship. The effects of cVA on initial courtship of virgin females can be blocked by expression of tetanus toxin in Or65a, but not Or67d neurons, demonstrating that the aversive effects of this pheromone are mediated by a specific class of olfactory neuron. These findings suggest that transfer of cVA to females during mating may be part of the male's strategy to suppress reproduction by competing males.",10.1016/j.cub.2007.01.053,2007,"Aki Ejima, Benjamin P C Smith, Christophe Lucas, Wynand van der Goes van Naters, Carson J Miller, John R Carlson, Joel D Levine, Leslie C Griffith"

The derived 481-amino acid sequence for D. melanogaster 6PGD is presented and compared with 6PGD sequences from other species. To characterize the cis-acting sequences necessary for expression of Pgd+, fragments containing this gene as well as Pgd+ promoter-lacZ fusions were introduced into the D. melanogaster germ line by P-element-mediated transformation. Our results indicate that the large second intron is critical for Pgd+ expression in adults. Only 421 bp of Pgd+ 5'-flanking DNA are necessary to direct expression in imaginal discs, gonads and gut of third-instar larvae. Sequences downstream from the transcription start point are necessary for expression in the larval fat body.",10.1016/0378-1119(91)90607-d,1991,"M J Scott, J C Lucchesi"
24514265,Deciphering the combinatorial architecture of a Drosophila homeotic gene enhancer,"In Drosophila, the 330 kb bithorax complex regulates cellular differentiation along the anterior–posterior axis during development in the thorax and abdomen and is comprised of three homeotic genes: Ultrabithorax, abdominal-A, and Abdominal-B. The expression of each of these genes is in turn controlled through interactions between transcription factors and a number of cis-regulatory modules in the neighboring intergenic regions. In this study, we examine how the sequence architecture of transcription factor binding sites mediates the functional activity of one of these cis-regulatory modules. Using computational, mathematical modeling and experimental molecular genetic approaches we investigate the IAB7b enhancer, which regulates Abdominal-B expression specifically in the presumptive seventh and ninth abdominal segments of the early embryo. A cross-species comparison of the IAB7b enhancer reveals an evolutionarily conserved signature motif containing two FUSHI-TARAZU activator transcription factor binding sites. We find that the transcriptional repressors KNIRPS, KRUPPEL and GIANT are able to restrict reporter gene expression to the posterior abdominal segments, using different molecular mechanisms including short-range repression and competitive binding. Additionally, we show the functional importance of the spacing between the two FUSHI-TARAZU binding sites and discuss the potential importance of cooperativity for transcriptional activation. Our results demonstrate that the transcriptional output of the IAB7b cis-regulatory module relies on a complex set of combinatorial inputs mediated by specific transcription factor binding and that the sequence architecture at this enhancer is critical to maintain robust regulatory function.",10.1016/j.mod.2013.10.002,2014,"Robert A Drewell, Michael J Nevarez, Jessica S Kurata, Lauren N Winkler, Lily Li, Jacqueline M Dresch"
24676142,Ndae1 expression and regulation in Drosophila embryos,"The construction and prediction of cell fate maps at the whole embryo level require the establishment of an accurate atlas of gene expression patterns throughout development and the identification of the corresponding cis-regulatory sequences. However, while the expression and regulation of genes encoding upstream developmental regulators such as transcription factors or signaling pathway components have been analyzed in detail, up to date the number of cis-regulatory sequences identified for downstream effector genes, like ion channels, pumps and exchangers, is very low. The control and regulation of ion homeostasis in each cell, including at blastoderm stages, are essential for normal embryonic development. In this study, we analyzed in detail the embryonic expression pattern and cis-regulatory modules of the Drosophila Na+-driven anion exchanger 1 (Ndae1) gene, involved in the regulation of pH homeostasis. We show that Ndae1 is expressed in a tight and complex spatial-temporal pattern. In particular, we report that this downstream effector gene is under the control of the canonical dorsal-ventral patterning cascade through dorsal, Toll, twist and snail at early embryogenesis. Moreover, we identify several cis-regulatory modules, some of which control discrete and non-overlapping aspects of endogenous gene expression throughout development.",10.1371/journal.pone.0092956,2014,"Maria Florencia Tevy, Denis Seyres, Concetta Traina, Laurent Perrin, Maria Capovilla"
7873402,Multiple regulatory elements direct the complex expression pattern of the Drosophila segmentation gene paired,"The paired (prd) gene of Drosophila belongs to the pair-rule class of segmentation genes involved in establishing the metameric organization of the Drosophila body plan. The complex expression pattern of prd has previously been shown to depend upon a number of segmentation genes, including gap and pair-rule genes. In an attempt to characterize and analyze the regulatory regions necessary and sufficient for prd expression, we have identified an 18-kb genomic fragment, consisting of the transcribed portion of prd and 10 kb of 5'- and 5 kb of 3'-flanking region, that is able to rescue prd mutant embryos to full viability. Analysis of a series of prd-lacZ fusion constructs containing progressively reduced lengths of prd 5'-flanking sequences delimits different cis-regulatory regions. The entire 5'-flanking region directs fusion gene expression in a pattern similar, but not identical, to the endogenous prd protein pattern. This 10-kb fragment contains both activator and repressor regions that mediate the establishment of the seven-stripe prd pattern, as well as the splitting into anterior and posterior stripes for the 14-stripe expression phase. The prd intron in combination with a minimal upstream region (0.15 kb) is able to direct low levels of prd-lacZ fusion gene expression in stripes. Information for expression of the anterior dorsal spot and of the early seven-stripe pattern is located downstream of the prd coding region. We propose that regulation of prd by pair-rule and gap gene products is mediated by upstream and downstream cis-regulatory elements. Regulation during separate but overlapping phases of expression by separable regulatory regions might be a general characteristic of segmentation genes.",10.1016/0925-4773(94)90021-3,1994,"T Gutjahr, C E Vanario-Alonso, L Pick, M Noll"
11020715,Genetically distinct cardial cells within the Drosophila heart,"Although often viewed as a simple pulsating tube, the Drosophila dorsal vessel is intricate in terms of its structure, cell types, and patterns of gene expression. Two nonidentical groups of cardial cells are observed in segments of the heart based on the differential expression of transcriptional regulators. These include sets of four cell pairs that express the homeodomain protein Tinman (Tin), alternating with groups of two cell pairs that express the orphan steroid hormone receptor Seven Up (Svp). Here we show that these myocardial cell populations are distinct in terms of their formation and gene expression profiles. The Svp-expressing cells are generated by asymmetric cell divisions of precursor cells based on decreases or increases in their numbers in numb or sanpodo mutant embryos. In contrast, the numbers of Tin-expressing cardial cells are unchanged in these genetic backgrounds, suggesting they arise from symmetric cell divisions. One function for Svp in the two pairs of cardial cells is to repress the expression of the tin gene and at least one of its targets, the beta3 tubulin gene. Further differences in the cells are substantiated by the identification of separable enhancers for D-mef2 gene transcription in the distinct cardioblast sets. Taken together, these results demonstrate a greater cellular and genetic complexity of the Drosophila heart than previously appreciated.",10.1002/1526-968x(200009)28:1<36::aid-gene50>3.0.co;2-4,2000,"K Gajewski, C Y Choi, Y Kim, R A Schulz"
15254275,Transcriptional regulation of the Drosophila caudal homeobox gene by DRE/DREF,"The caudal-related homeobox transcription factors are required for the normal development and differentiation of intestinal cells. Recent reports indicate that misregulation of homeotic gene expression is associated with gastrointestinal cancer in mammals. However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate expression of the caudal-related homeobox genes are poorly understood. In this study, we have identified a DNA replication-related element (DRE) in the 5' flanking region of the Drosophila caudal gene. Gel-mobility shift analysis reveals that three of the four DRE-related sequences in the caudal 5'-flanking region are recognized by the DRE-binding factor (DREF). Deletion and site-directed mutagenesis of these DRE sites results in a considerable reduction in caudal gene promoter activity. Analyses with transgenic flies carrying a caudal-lacZ fusion gene bearing wild-type or mutant DRE sites indicate that the DRE sites are required for caudal expression in vivo. These findings indicate that DRE/DREF is a key regulator of Drosophila caudal homeobox gene expression and suggest that DREs and DREF contribute to intestinal development by regulating caudal gene expression.",10.1093/nar/gkh688,2004,"Yoon-Jeong Choi, Tae-Young Choi, Masamitsu Yamaguchi, Akio Matsukage, Young-Shin Kim, Mi-Ae Yoo"
9043065,Ftz-F1 is a cofactor in Ftz activation of the Drosophila engrailed gene,"The fushi tarazu pair-rule gene is required for the formation of alternating parasegmental boundaries in the Drosophila embryo. fushi tarazu encodes a homeodomain protein necessary for transcription of the engrailed gene in even-numbered parasegments. Here we report that, within an engrailed enhancer, adjacent and conserved binding sites for the Fushi tarazu protein and a cofactor are each necessary, and together sufficient, for transcriptional activation. Footprinting shows that the cofactor site can be bound specifically by Ftz-F1, a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily. Ftz-F1 and the Fushi tarazu homeodomain bind the sites with 4- to 8-fold cooperativity, suggesting that direct contact between the two proteins may contribute to target recognition. Even parasegmental reporter expression is dependent on Fushi tarazu and maternal Ftz-F1, suggesting that these two proteins are indeed the factors that act upon the two sites in embryos. The two adjacent binding sites are also required for continued activity of the engrailed enhancer after Fushi tarazu protein is no longer detectable, including the period when engrailed, and the enhancer, become dependent upon wingless. We also report the existence of a separate negative regulatory element that apparently responds to odd-skipped.",,1997,"B Florence, A Guichet, A Ephrussi, A Laughon"
28760811,Patterning of the Drosophila L2 vein is driven by regulatory interactions between region-specific transcription factors expressed in response to Dpp signalling,"Pattern formation relies on the generation of transcriptional landscapes regulated by signalling pathways. A paradigm of epithelial patterning is the distribution of vein territories in the Drosophila wing disc. In this tissue, Decapentaplegic signalling regulates its target genes at different distances from the source of the ligand. The transformation of signalling into coherent territories of gene expression requires regulatory cross-interactions between these target genes. Here, we analyse the mechanisms generating the domain of knirps expression in the presumptive L2 vein of the wing imaginal disc. We find that knirps is regulated by four Decapentaplegic target genes encoding the transcription factors aristaless, spalt major, spalt-related and optix The expression of optix is activated by Dpp and repressed by the Spalt proteins, becoming restricted to the most anterior region of the wing blade. In turn, the expression of knirps is activated by Aristaless and repressed by Optix and the Spalt proteins. In this manner, the expression of knirps becomes restricted to those cells where Spalt levels are sufficient to repress optix, but not sufficient to repress knirps.",10.1242/dev.143461,2017,"Mercedes Martín, Cristina M Ostalé, Jose F de Celis"

We have previously shown that a different cis-acting DNA region is required for each of these tissue specificities. In this paper we use germ line transformation to localize and characterized one of these tissue-specific regulatory regions. We demonstrate that a 125 bp segment of DNA located 196 bp upstream of the yp1 cap site is sufficient to determine the sex-, stage-, and fat body-specific expression of the yp1 gene. We also find that this region can confer yp1-specific expression on a heterologous Drosophila promoter. This specificity is retained when the region is in different orientations and at different distances from the heterologous promoter. Thus a small regulatory region acts in vivo as a positive enhancer to determine the fat body expression pattern of yp1.",10.1016/0092-8674(86)90560-x,1986,"M J Garabedian, B M Shepherd, P C Wensink"
22005665,Second order regulator Collier directly controls intercalary-specific segment polarity gene expression,"In Drosophila, trunk metamerization is established by a cascade of segmentation gene activities: the gap genes, the pair rule genes, and the segment polarity genes. In the anterior head, metamerization requires also gap-like genes and segment polarity genes. However, because the pair rule genes are not active in this part of the embryo, the question on which gene activities are fulfilling the role of the second order regulator genes still remains to be solved. Here we provide first molecular evidence that the Helix-Loop-Helix-COE transcription factor Collier fulfills this role by directly activating the expression of the segment polarity gene hedgehog in the posterior part of the intercalary segment. Collier thereby occupies a newly identified binding site within an intercalary-specific cis-regulatory element. Moreover, we identified a direct physical association between Collier and the basic-leucine-zipper transcription factor Cap'n'collar B, which seems to restrict the activating input of Collier to the posterior part of the intercalary segment and to lead to the attenuation of hedgehog expression in the intercalary lobes at later stages.",10.1016/j.ydbio.2011.09.035,2011,"Evgenia Ntini, Ernst A Wimmer"
21693522,How to make stripes: deciphering the transition from non-periodic to periodic patterns in Drosophila segmentation,"The generation of metameric body plans is a key process in development. In Drosophila segmentation, periodicity is established rapidly through the complex transcriptional regulation of the pair-rule genes. The 'primary' pair-rule genes generate their 7-stripe expression through stripe-specific cis-regulatory elements controlled by the preceding non-periodic maternal and gap gene patterns, whereas 'secondary' pair-rule genes are thought to rely on 7-stripe elements that read off the already periodic primary pair-rule patterns. Using a combination of computational and experimental approaches, we have conducted a comprehensive systems-level examination of the regulatory architecture underlying pair-rule stripe formation. We find that runt (run), fushi tarazu (ftz) and odd skipped (odd) establish most of their pattern through stripe-specific elements, arguing for a reclassification of ftz and odd as primary pair-rule genes. In the case of run, we observe long-range cis-regulation across multiple intervening genes. The 7-stripe elements of run, ftz and odd are active concurrently with the stripe-specific elements, indicating that maternal/gap-mediated control and pair-rule gene cross-regulation are closely integrated. Stripe-specific elements fall into three distinct classes based on their principal repressive gap factor input; stripe positions along the gap gradients correlate with the strength of predicted input. The prevalence of cis-elements that generate two stripes and their genomic organization suggest that single-stripe elements arose by splitting and subfunctionalization of ancestral dual-stripe elements. Overall, our study provides a greatly improved understanding of how periodic patterns are established in the Drosophila embryo.",10.1242/dev.062141,2011,"Mark D Schroeder, Christina Greer, Ulrike Gaul"
