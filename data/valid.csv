17936744,The Friend of GATA protein U-shaped functions as a hematopoietic tumor suppressor in Drosophila,"Drosophila has emerged as an important model system to discover and analyze genes controlling hematopoiesis. One regulatory network known to control hemocyte differentiation is the Janus kinase (JAK)/Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT) signal-transduction pathway. A constitutive activation mutation of the Janus kinase Hopscotch (hopscotch(Tumorous-lethal); hop(Tum-l)) results in a leukemia-like over-proliferation of hemocytes and copious differentiation of lamellocytes during larval stages. Here we show that the Friend of GATA (FOG) protein U-shaped (Ush) is expressed in circulating and lymph gland hemocytes, where it plays a critical role in controlling blood cell proliferation and differentiation. Our findings demonstrate that a reduction in ush function results in hematopoietic phenotypes strikingly similar to those observed in hop(Tum-l) animals. These include lymph gland hypertrophy, increased circulating hemocyte concentration, and abundant production of lamellocytes. Forced expression of N-terminal truncated versions of Ush likewise leads to larvae with severe hematopoietic anomalies. In contrast, expression of wild-type Ush results in a strong suppression of hop(Tum-l) phenotypes. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that U-shaped acts to control larval hemocyte proliferation and suppress lamellocyte differentiation, likely regulating hematopoietic events downstream of Hop kinase activity. Such functions appear to be facilitated through Ush interaction with the hematopoietic GATA factor Serpent (Srp).",10.1016/j.ydbio.2007.08.011,2007,"Richard Paul Sorrentino, Tsuyoshi Tokusumi, Robert A Schulz"
18667158,A presynaptic gain control mechanism fine-tunes olfactory behavior,"Early sensory processing can play a critical role in sensing environmental cues. We have investigated the physiological and behavioral function of gain control at the first synapse of olfactory processing in Drosophila. Olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) express the GABA(B) receptor (GABA(B)R), and its expression expands the dynamic range of ORN synaptic transmission that is preserved in projection neuron responses. Strikingly, each ORN channel has a unique baseline level of GABA(B)R expression. ORNs that sense the aversive odorant CO(2) do not express GABA(B)Rs and do not have significant presynaptic inhibition. In contrast, pheromone-sensing ORNs express a high level of GABA(B)Rs and exhibit strong presynaptic inhibition. Furthermore, pheromone-dependent mate localization is impaired in flies that lack GABA(B)Rs in specific ORNs. These findings indicate that different olfactory receptor channels employ heterogeneous presynaptic gain control as a mechanism to allow an animal's innate behavioral responses to match its ecological needs.",10.1016/j.neuron.2008.07.003,2008,"Cory M Root, Kaoru Masuyama, David S Green, Lina E Enell, Dick R NÃ¤ssel, Chi-Hon Lee, Jing W Wang"
18986212,Evolution acts on enhancer organization to fine-tune gradient threshold readouts,"The elucidation of principles governing evolution of gene regulatory sequence is critical to the study of metazoan diversification. We are therefore exploring the structure and organizational constraints of regulatory sequences by studying functionally equivalent cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) that have been evolving in parallel across several loci. Such an independent dataset allows a multi-locus study that is not hampered by nonfunctional or constrained homology. The neurogenic ectoderm enhancers (NEEs) of Drosophila melanogaster are one such class of coordinately regulated CRMs. The NEEs share a common organization of binding sites and as a set would be useful to study the relationship between CRM organization and CRM activity across evolving lineages. We used the D. melanogaster transgenic system to screen for functional adaptations in the NEEs from divergent drosophilid species. We show that the individual NEE modules across a genome in any one lineage have independently evolved adaptations to compensate for lineage-specific developmental and/or genomic changes. Specifically, we show that both the site composition and the site organization of NEEs have been finely tuned by distinct, lineage-specific selection pressures in each of the three divergent species that we have examined: D. melanogaster, D. pseudoobscura, and D. virilis. Furthermore, by precisely altering the organization of NEEs with different morphogen gradient threshold readouts, we show that CRM organizational evolution is sufficient for explaining changes in enhancer activity. Thus, evolution can act on CRM organization to fine-tune morphogen gradient threshold readouts over a wide dynamic range. Our study demonstrates that equivalence classes of CRMs are powerful tools for detecting lineage-specific adaptations by gene regulatory sequences.",10.1371/journal.pbio.0060263,2008,"Justin Crocker, Yoichiro Tamori, Albert Erives"
30842209,Redundant and Cryptic Enhancer Activities of the Drosophila yellow Gene,"Cis-regulatory sequences known as enhancers play a key role in regulating gene expression. Evolutionary changes in these DNA sequences contribute to phenotypic evolution. The Drosophila yellow gene, which is required for pigmentation, has emerged as a model system for understanding how cis-regulatory sequences evolve, providing some of the most detailed insights available into how activities of orthologous enhancers have diverged between species. Here, we examine the evolution of yellow cis-regulatory sequences on a broader scale, by comparing the distribution and function of yellow enhancer activities throughout the 5' intergenic and intronic sequences of Drosophila melanogaster, D. pseudoobscura, and D. willistoni We find that cis-regulatory sequences driving expression in a particular tissue are not as modular as previously described, but rather have many redundant and cryptic enhancer activities distributed throughout the regions surveyed. Interestingly, cryptic enhancer activities of sequences from one species often drove patterns of expression observed in other species, suggesting that the frequent evolutionary changes in yellow expression observed among Drosophila species may be facilitated by gaining and losing repression of preexisting cis-regulatory sequences.",10.1534/genetics.119.301985,2019,"Gizem Kalay, Jennifer Lachowiec, Ulises Rosas, Mackenzie R Dome, Patricia Wittkopp"
25760344,Cis-regulatory mechanisms for robust olfactory sensory neuron class-restricted odorant receptor gene expression in Drosophila,"Odor perception requires that each olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) class continuously express a single odorant receptor (OR) regardless of changes in the environment. However, little is known about the control of the robust, class-specific OR expression involved. Here, we investigate the cis-regulatory mechanisms and components that generate robust and OSN class-specific OR expression in Drosophila. Our results demonstrate that the spatial restriction of expression to a single OSN class is directed by clusters of transcription-factor DNA binding motifs. Our dissection of motif clusters of differing complexity demonstrates that structural components such as motif overlap and motif order integrate transcription factor combinations and chromatin status to form a spatially restricted pattern. We further demonstrate that changes in metabolism or temperature perturb the function of complex clusters. We show that the cooperative regulation between motifs around and within the cluster generates robust, class-specific OR expression.",10.1371/journal.pgen.1005051,2015,"Shadi Jafari, Mattias Alenius"
30005136,Mutational analysis of a Drosophila neuroblast enhancer governing nubbin expression during CNS development,"While developmental studies of Drosophila neural stem cell lineages have identified transcription factors (TFs) important to cell identity decisions, currently only an incomplete understanding exists of the cis-regulatory elements that control the dynamic expression of these TFs. Our previous studies have identified multiple enhancers that regulate the POU-domain TF paralogs nubbin and pdm-2 genes. Evolutionary comparative analysis of these enhancers reveals that they each contain multiple conserved sequence blocks (CSBs) that span TF DNA-binding sites for known regulators of neuroblast (NB) gene expression in addition to novel sequences. This study functionally analyzes the conserved DNA sequence elements within a NB enhancer located within the nubbin gene and highlights a high level of complexity underlying enhancer structure. Mutational analysis has revealed CSBs that are important for enhancer activation and silencing in the developing CNS. We have also observed that adjusting the number and relative positions of the TF binding sites within these CSBs alters enhancer function.",10.1002/dvg.23237,2018,"Jermaine Ross, Alexander Kuzin, Thomas Brody, Ward F Odenwald"
22347718,Thermosensory and nonthermosensory isoforms of Drosophila melanogaster TRPA1 reveal heat-sensor domains of a thermoTRP Channel,"Specialized somatosensory neurons detect temperatures ranging from pleasantly cool or warm to burning hot and painful (nociceptive). The precise temperature ranges sensed by thermally sensitive neurons is determined by tissue-specific expression of ion channels of the transient receptor potential(TRP) family.We show here that in Drosophila, TRPA1 is required for the sensing of nociceptive heat. We identify two previously unidentified protein isoforms of dTRPA1, named dTRPA1-C and dTRPA1-D, that explain this requirement. A dTRPA1-C/D reporter was exclusively expressed in nociceptors, and dTRPA1-C rescued thermal nociception phenotypes when restored to mutant nociceptors. However,surprisingly, we find that dTRPA1-C is not a direct heat sensor. Alternative splicing generates at least four isoforms of dTRPA1. Our analysis of these isoforms reveals a 37-amino-acid-long intracellular region (encoded by a single exon) that is critical for dTRPA1 temperature responses. The identification of these amino acids opens the door to a biophysical understanding of a molecular thermosensor.",10.1016/j.celrep.2011.11.002,2012,"Lixian Zhong, Andrew Bellemer, Haidun Yan, Honjo Ken, Robertson Jessica, Richard Y Hwang, Geoffrey S Pitt, W Daniel Tracey"
1362651,A cis-element mediating Ultrabithorax autoregulation in the central nervous system,"We dissected an upstream control region (a BXD fragment) from the homeotic gene Ultrabithorax (Ubx) of Drosophila which confers a Ubx-like expression pattern in the embryonic ectoderm. We found several distinct enhancer elements spread through the whole BXD fragment each of which is active in transformed embryos, mediating a different pattern of beta-galactosidase expression in the ventral nerve cord. The strongest of these patterns mimics Ubx expression within the Ubx domain. This pattern is strictly dependent on Ubx function. Thus, the BXD control region contains a Ubx response element, suggesting that positive autoregulation of Ubx may occur in the central nervous system of the developing embryo.",10.1016/0925-4773(92)90027-h,1992,"B Christen, M Bienz"
24907418,The expansion of body coloration involves coordinated evolution in cis and trans within the pigmentation regulatory network of Drosophila prostipennis,"The generation of complex morphological features requires the precisely orchestrated expression of numerous genes during development. While several traits have been resolved to evolutionary changes within a single gene, the evolutionary path by which genes derive co-localized or mutually excluded expression patterns is currently a mystery. Here we investigate how the Drosophila pigmentation gene network was altered in Drosophila prostipennis, a species in the Drosophila melanogaster subgroup, that evolved expanded abdominal pigmentation. We show that this expansion involved broadened expression of the melanin-promoting enzyme genes tan and yellow, and a reciprocal withdrawn pattern of the melanin-suppressing enzyme gene ebony. To examine whether these coordinated changes to the network were generated through mutations in the cis-regulatory elements (CREs) of these genes, we cloned and tested CREs of D. prostipennis tan, ebony, and yellow in transgenic reporter assays. Regulatory regions of both tan and ebony failed to recapitulate the derived D. prostipennis expression phenotype, implicating the modification of a factor or factors upstream of both genes. However, the D. prostipennis yellow cis-regulatory region recapitulated the expanded expression pattern observed in this species, implicating causative mutations in cis to yellow. Our results provide an example in which a coordinated expression program evolved through independent changes at multiple loci, rather than through changes to a single ""master regulator"" directing a suite of downstream target genes. This implies a complex network structure in which each gene may be subject to a unique set of inputs, and resultantly may require individualized evolutionary paths to yield correlated gene expression patterns.",10.1016/j.ydbio.2014.05.023,2014,"Alison J Ordway, Kerry N Hancuch, Winslow Johnson, Thomas M Wiliams, Mark Rebeiz"
27293191,Enhancer Control of Transcriptional Bursting,"Transcription is episodic, consisting of a series of discontinuous bursts. Using live-imaging methods and quantitative analysis, we examine transcriptional bursting in living Drosophila embryos. Different developmental enhancers positioned downstream of synthetic reporter genes produce transcriptional bursts with similar amplitudes and duration but generate very different bursting frequencies, with strong enhancers producing more bursts than weak enhancers. Insertion of an insulator reduces the number of bursts and the corresponding level of gene expression, suggesting that enhancer regulation of bursting frequency is a key parameter of gene control in development. We also show that linked reporter genes exhibit coordinated bursting profiles when regulated by a shared enhancer, challenging conventional models of enhancer-promoter looping.",10.1016/j.cell.2016.05.025,2016,"Takashi Fukaya, Bomyi Lim, Michael Levine"
10226011,"Analysis of an even-skipped rescue transgene reveals both composite and discrete neuronal and early blastoderm enhancers, and multi-stripe positioning by gap gene repressor gradients","The entire functional even-skipped locus of Drosophila melanogaster is contained within a 16 kilobase region. As a transgene, this region is capable of rescuing even-skipped mutant flies to fertile adulthood. Detailed analysis of the 7.7 kb of regulatory DNA 3' of the transcription unit revealed ten novel, independently regulated patterns. Most of these patterns are driven by non-overlapping regulatory elements, including ones for syncytial blastoderm stage stripes 1 and 5, while a single element specifies both stripes 4 and 6. Expression analysis in gap gene mutants showed that stripe 5 is restricted anteriorly by KrÃ¼ppel and posteriorly by giant, the same repressors that regulate stripe 2. Consistent with the coregulation of stripes 4 and 6 by a single cis-element, both the anterior border of stripe 4 and the posterior border of stripe 6 are set by zygotic hunchback, and the region between the two stripes is 'carved out' by knirps. Thus the boundaries of stripes 4 and 6 are set through negative regulation by the same gap gene domains that regulate stripes 3 and 7 (Small, S., Blair, A. and Levine, M. (1996) Dev. Biol. 175, 314-24), but at different concentrations. The 3' region also contains a single element for neurogenic expression in ganglion mother cells 4-2a and 1-1a, and neurons derived from them (RP2, a/pCC), suggesting common regulators in these lineages. In contrast, separable elements were found for expression in EL neurons, U/CQ neurons and the mesoderm. The even-skipped 3' untranslated region is required to maintain late stage protein expression in RP2 and a/pCC neurons, and appears to affect protein levels rather than mRNA levels. Additionally, a strong pairing-sensitive repression element was localized to the 3' end of the locus, but was not found to contribute to efficient functional rescue.",,1999,"M Fujioka, Y Emi-Sarker, G L Yusibova, T Goto, J B Jaynes"
8199047,Regulatory and coding regions of the segmentation gene hunchback are functionally conserved between Drosophila virilis and Drosophila melanogaster,"The segmentation gene hunchback (hb) is involved in setting up the anterior-posterior axis of the Drosophila embryo. It is expressed maternally and zygotically and it plays a key role in integrating the effects of the anterior and posterior maternal systems. The hb gene from D. virilis has previously been cloned and was shown to be well conserved in its coding region, but less so in its upstream region which shows a more patchy pattern of conserved and diverged sequences. This work deals with the functional conservation of hb between the two species. We have mapped two additional regulatory elements for the expression of hb in the early embryo, namely the enhancer for the maternal expression and the enhancer region for the late blastoderm expression. Fragments containing these two elements, the previously identified bicoid dependent element for the early blastoderm expression of hb and the coding region were taken from D. virilis and tested in the D. melanogaster background. We find that all enhancer elements as well as the coding region are functionally conserved between the two species. Comparison of the upstream sequences that include the enhancer region for the late blastoderm expression reveal seven highly conserved blocks. Some of these contain consensus binding sites for transregulatory factors that are likely to control the respective expression domains.",10.1016/0925-4773(94)90024-8,1994,"W Lukowitz, C SchrÃ¶der, G Glaser, M HÃ¼lskamp, D Tautz"
12464428,Control of Dopa decarboxylase gene expression by the Broad-Complex during metamorphosis in Drosophila,"The induction of the Dopa decarboxylase gene (Ddc) in the epidermis of Drosophila at pupariation is a receptor-mediated response to the steroid molting hormone, ecdysone. Activity is also dependent on the Broad-Complex (BR-C), an early ecdysone response gene that functions during metamorphosis. BR-C encodes a family of zinc-finger protein isoforms, BR-C(Z1-Z4). Genetic experiments have shown that the Z2 isoform is required for epidermal Ddc to reach maximum expression at pupariation. In this paper, we report that BR-C regulates Ddc expression at two different developmental stages through two different cis-acting regions. At pupariation, BR-C acts synergistically with the ecdysone receptor to up-regulate Ddc. DNase I foot printing has identified four binding sites of the predominant Z2 isoform within a distal regulatory element that is required for maximal Ddc activity. The sites share a conserved core sequence with a set of BR-C sites that had been mapped previously to within the first Ddc intron. Using variously deleted Ddc genomic regions to drive reporter gene expression in transgenic organisms, we show that the intronic binding sites are required for Ddc expression at eclosion. At both pupariation and eclosion, BR-C releases Ddc from an active silencing mechanism, operating through two distinct cis-acting regions of the Ddc genomic domain at these stages. Transgenes, bearing a Ddc fragment from which one of the cis-acting silencers has been deleted, exhibit beta-galactosidase reporter activity in the epidermal cells prior to the appearance of endogenous DDC. Our finding that BR-C is required for Ddc activation at eclosion is the first evidence to suggest that this important regulator of the early metamorphic events, also regulates target gene expression at the end of metamorphosis.",10.1016/s0925-4773(02)00346-5,2002,"Li Chen, Sandra L O'Keefe, Ross B Hodgetts"
29225023,Origins and Specification of the Drosophila Wing,"The insect wing is a key evolutionary innovation that was essential for insect diversification. Yet despite its importance, there is still debate about its evolutionary origins. Two main hypotheses have been proposed: the paranotal hypothesis, which suggests that wings evolved as an extension of the dorsal thorax, and the gill-exite hypothesis, which proposes that wings were derived from a modification of a pre-existing branch at the dorsal base (subcoxa) of the leg. Here, we address this question by studying how wing fates are initially specified during Drosophila embryogenesis, by characterizing a cis-regulatory module (CRM) from the snail (sna) gene, sna-DP (for dorsal primordia). sna-DP specifically marks the early primordia for both the wing and haltere, collectively referred to as the DP. We found that the inputs that activate sna-DP are distinct from those that activate Distalless, a marker for leg fates. Further, in genetic backgrounds in which the leg primordia are absent, the DP are still partially specified. However, lineage-tracing experiments demonstrate that cells from the early leg primordia contribute to both ventral and dorsal appendage fates. Together, these results suggest that the wings of Drosophila have a dual developmental origin: two groups of cells, one ventral and one more dorsal, give rise to the mature wing. We suggest that the dual developmental origins of the wing may be a molecular remnant of the evolutionary history of this appendage, in which cells of the subcoxa of the leg coalesced with dorsal outgrowths to evolve a dorsal appendage with motor control.",10.1016/j.cub.2017.11.023,2017,"David Requena, Jose Andres Ãlvarez, Hugo Gabilondo, Ryan Loker, Richard S Mann, Carlos Estella"
15708571,Condensation of the central nervous system in embryonic Drosophila is inhibited by blocking hemocyte migration or neural activity,"Condensation is a process whereby a tissue undergoes a coordinated decrease in size and increase in cellular density during development. Although it occurs in many developmental contexts, the mechanisms underlying this process are largely unknown. Here, we investigate condensation in the embryonic Drosophila ventral nerve cord (VNC). Two major events coincide with condensation during embryogenesis: the deposition of extracellular matrix by hemocytes, and the onset of central nervous system activity. We find that preventing hemocyte migration by removing the function of the Drosophila VEGF receptor homologue, Pvr, or by disrupting Rac1 function in these cells, inhibits condensation. In the absence of hemocytes migrating adjacent to the developing VNC, the extracellular matrix components Collagen IV, Viking and Peroxidasin are not deposited around this tissue. Blocking neural activity by targeted expression of tetanus toxin light chain or an inwardly rectifying potassium channel also inhibits condensation. We find that disrupting Rac1 function in either glia or neurons, including those located in the nerve cord, causes a similar phenotype. Our data suggest that condensation of the VNC during Drosophila embryogenesis depends on both hemocyte-deposited extracellular matrix and neural activity, and allow us to propose a mechanism whereby these processes work together to shape the developing central nervous system.",10.1016/j.ydbio.2004.12.020,2005,"Birgitta Olofsson, Damon T Page"
17908931,Temporal ChIP-on-chip reveals Biniou as a universal regulator of the visceral muscle transcriptional network,"Smooth muscle plays a prominent role in many fundamental processes and diseases, yet our understanding of the transcriptional network regulating its development is very limited. The FoxF transcription factors are essential for visceral smooth muscle development in diverse species, although their direct regulatory role remains elusive. We present a transcriptional map of Biniou (a FoxF transcription factor) and Bagpipe (an Nkx factor) activity, as a first step to deciphering the developmental program regulating Drosophila visceral muscle development. A time course of chromatin immunoprecipitatation followed by microarray analysis (ChIP-on-chip) experiments and expression profiling of mutant embryos reveal a dynamic map of in vivo bound enhancers and direct target genes. While Biniou is broadly expressed, it regulates enhancers driving temporally and spatially restricted expression. In vivo reporter assays indicate that the timing of Biniou binding is a key trigger for the time span of enhancer activity. Although bagpipe and biniou mutants phenocopy each other, their regulatory potential is quite different. This network architecture was not apparent from genetic studies, and highlights Biniou as a universal regulator in all visceral muscle, regardless of its developmental origin or subsequent function. The regulatory connection of a number of Biniou target genes is conserved in mice, suggesting an ancient wiring of this developmental program.",10.1101/gad.437607,2007,"Janus S Jakobsen, Martina Braun, Jeanette Astorga, E Hilary Gustafson, Thomas Sandmann, Michal Karzynski, Peter Carlsson, Eileen E M Furlong"
1325394,The dorsal gradient morphogen regulates stripes of rhomboid expression in the presumptive neuroectoderm of the Drosophila embryo,"rhomboid (rho) encodes a putative transmembrane receptor that is required for the differentiation of the ventral epidermis. It is initially expressed before the completion of cellularization in lateral stripes within the presumptive neuroectoderm. Here, we present evidence that the maternal morphogen dorsal (dl) acts in concert with basic helix-loop-helix (b-HLH) proteins, possibly including twist (twi), to activate rho in both lateral and ventral regions. Expression is blocked in ventral regions (the presumptive mesoderm) by snail (sna), which is also a direct target of the dl morphogen. A 300-bp region of the rho promoter (the NEE), which is sufficient for neuroectoderm expression, contains a cluster of dl and b-HLH activator sites that are closely linked to sna repressor sites. Mutations in these binding sites cause genetically predicted changes in the levels and limits of rho expression. In particular, the disruption of sna-binding sites causes a derepression of the pattern throughout ventral regions, providing evidence that sna is directly responsible for establishing the mesoderm/neuroectoderm boundary before gastrulation. The tight linkage of activator and repressor sites in the rho NEE is similar to the arrangement of binding sites observed in the even-skipped stripe 2 element, which is regulated by bicoid (bcd). This suggests that the dl and bcd morphogens use a similar mechanism to make stripes in the Drosophila embryo.",10.1101/gad.6.9.1728,1992,"Y T Ip, R E Park, D Kosman, E Bier, M Levine"
17082773,JNK- and Fos-regulated Mmp1 expression cooperates with Ras to induce invasive tumors in Drosophila,"Loss of the epithelial polarity gene scribble in clones of Drosophila imaginal disc cells can cooperate with Ras signaling to induce malignant tumors. Such mutant tissue overproliferates, resists apoptosis, leaves its place of origin and invades other organs, ultimately causing lethality. We show that increased Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling resulting from the loss of scribble promotes the movement of transformed cells to secondary sites. This effect requires Fos-dependent transcriptional activation of a matrix metalloprotease gene mmp1 downstream of JNK. Expression of the Mmp inhibitor Timp or Mmp RNAi knockdown suppresses cell invasiveness. The proinvasive function of the JNK pathway is revealed in a tumor context when active Ras signaling prevents the apoptotic response to JNK activity as it occurs in nontransformed cells. Based on these results, we present a model that explains the oncogenic cooperation between JNK and Ras, and describes how aberrant regulation of cell survival, proliferation and mobilization cooperate to incite malignant tumor formation.",10.1038/sj.emboj.7601401,2006,"Mirka Uhlirova, Dirk Bohmann"
22267917,Identification of cis-Regulatory Elements in the dmyc Gene of Drosophila Melanogaster,"Myc is a crucial regulator of growth and proliferation during animal development. Many signals and transcription factors lead to changes in the expression levels of Drosophila myc, yet no clear model exists to explain the complexity of its regulation at the level of transcription. In this study we used Drosophila genetic tools to track the dmyc cis-regulatory elements. Bioinformatics analyses identified conserved sequence blocks in the noncoding regions of the dmyc gene. Investigation of lacZ reporter activity driven by upstream, downstream, and intronic sequences of the dmyc gene in embryonic, larval imaginal discs, larval brain, and adult ovaries, revealed that it is likely to be transcribed from multiple transcription initiation units including a far upstream regulatory region, a TATA box containing proximal complex and a TATA-less downstream promoter element in conjunction with an initiator within the intron 2 region. Our data provide evidence for a modular organization of dmyc regulatory sequences; these modules will most likely be required to generate the tissue-specific patterns of dmyc transcripts. The far upstream region is active in late embryogenesis, while activity of other cis elements is evident during embryogenesis, in specific larval imaginal tissues and during oogenesis. These data provide a framework for further investigation of the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms of dmyc.",10.4137/GRSB.S8044,2012,"Jasmine Kharazmi, Cameron Moshfegh, Thomas Brody"
9748283,The DNA replication-related element (DRE)/DRE-binding factor system is a transcriptional regulator of the Drosophila E2F gene,"Two mRNA species were observed for the Drosophila E2F (dE2F) gene, differing with regard to the first exons (exon 1-a and exon 1-b), which were expressed differently during development. A single transcription initiation site for mRNA containing exon 1-b was mapped by primer extension analysis and numbered +1. We found three tandemly aligned sequences, similar to the DNA replication-related element (DRE; 5'-TATCGATA), which is commonly required for transcription of genes related to DNA replication and cell proliferation, in the region upstream of this site. Band mobility shift analyses using oligonucleotides containing the DRE-related sequences with or without various base substitutions revealed that two out of three DRE-related sequences are especially important for binding to the DRE-binding factor (DREF). On footprinting analysis with Kc cell nuclear extracts and a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein with the N-terminal fragment (1-125 amino acid residues) of DREF, all three DRE-related sequences were found to be protected. Transient luciferase expression assays in Kc cells demonstrated that the region containing the three DRE-related sequences is required for high promoter activity. We have established transgenic lines of Drosophila in which ectopic expression of DREF was targeted to the eye imaginal disc cells. Overexpression of DREF in eye imaginal disc cells enhanced the promoter activity of dE2F. The obtained results indicate that the DRE/DREF system activates transcription of the dE2F gene.",10.1074/jbc.273.40.26042,1998,"T Sawado, F Hirose, Y Takahashi, T Sasaki, T Shinomiya, K Sakaguchi, A Matsukage, M Yamaguchi"
27379389,Regulation of the BMP Signaling-Responsive Transcriptional Network in the Drosophila Embryo,"The BMP signaling pathway has a conserved role in dorsal-ventral axis patterning during embryonic development. In Drosophila, graded BMP signaling is transduced by the Mad transcription factor and opposed by the Brinker repressor. In this study, using the Drosophila embryo as a model, we combine RNA-seq with Mad and Brinker ChIP-seq to decipher the BMP-responsive transcriptional network underpinning differentiation of the dorsal ectoderm during dorsal-ventral axis patterning. We identify multiple new BMP target genes, including positive and negative regulators of EGF signaling. Manipulation of EGF signaling levels by loss- and gain-of-function studies reveals that EGF signaling negatively regulates embryonic BMP-responsive transcription. Therefore, the BMP gene network has a self-regulating property in that it establishes a balance between its activity and that of the antagonistic EGF signaling pathway to facilitate correct patterning. In terms of BMP-dependent transcription, we identify key roles for the Zelda and ZerknÃ¼llt transcription factors in establishing the resulting expression domain, and find widespread binding of insulator proteins to the Mad and Brinker-bound genomic regions. Analysis of embryos lacking the BEAF-32 insulator protein shows reduced transcription of a peak BMP target gene and a reduction in the number of amnioserosa cells, the fate specified by peak BMP signaling. We incorporate our findings into a model for Mad-dependent activation, and discuss its relevance to BMP signal interpretation in vertebrates.",10.1371/journal.pgen.1006164,2016,"Lisa Deignan, Marco T Pinheiro, Catherine Sutcliffe, Abbie Saunders, Scott G Wilcockson, Leo A H Zeef, Ian J Donaldson, Hilary L Ashe"
3011424,Several hundred base pairs upstream of Drosophila hsp23 and 26 genes are required for their heat induction in transformed flies,"We have used the P-element-mediated transformation of Drosophila germ line to study the 5' DNA sequences involved in the thermal inducibility of the genes for heat shock proteins hsp23 and 26. The results are strikingly different from those previously obtained in heterologous systems. For hsp23, each successive shortening of the promoter region from 618 to 402, 321 and 263 bp clearly decreased the expression. A construct with only 149 bp was not inducible at all. For hsp26, all the regulatory elements appear to be clustered in the first 350 bp upstream from the cap site. Clones with 171 bp showed a 4- to 10-fold decrease in induction depending on the transformed line, and those with only 52 bp were not expressed. The results suggest that at least three Pelham consensus sequences are required for the full expression of these two genes. The direct involvement of one of these consensus sequences has been assessed: a 6-bp deletion within the proximal element of the hsp26 gene strongly reduced its inducibility. Our results also indicate that X-linked hsp genes exhibit either partial dosage compensation or none at all.",,1986,"D Pauli, A Spierer, A TissiÃ¨res"
8404855,Molecular mechanisms of pattern formation by the BRE enhancer of the Ubx gene,"The core activity of the Ubx gene enhancer BRE (bx region enhancer) is encoded within a 500 bp module. bx DNA outside this active module increases the level of expression, expands the expression into ventro-lateral ectoderm and partially stabilizes the late expression pattern. The products of the gap genes hb and tll and of the pair-rule gene ftz bind to the 500 bp BRE module and control directly its initial pattern of expression. ftz enhances expression in even-numbered parasegments within the correct spatial domain whose boundaries are set by hb and tll. In addition, en and twi products activate the enhancer, probably directly. en broadens the parasegmental stripe while twi cooperates with ftz to enhance expression in the mesoderm. Binding sites for the five regulators are closely clustered, often overlapping extensively with one another. In vitro, hb blocks the binding of ftz and can also displace ftz protein pre-bound to an overlapping site, suggesting that competitive binding and/or interference by hb sets the initial boundaries of the domain of expression.

Transcription of thousands of genes is regulated by the interaction of several proteins or complexes, including a tTAF-containing TFIID variant, tMAC, Mediator, and chromatin interactors, e.g., bromodomain proteins. We addressed how distinct subsets of target genes are selected. We characterized the highly similar proteins tPlus3a and tPlus3b, which contain a Plus3 domain and are enriched in the testis, mainly in spermatocytes. In tPlus3a and tplus3b deletion mutants generated using the CRISPR/Cas9 system, fertility was severely reduced and sperm showed defects during individualization. tPlus3a and tPlus3b heterodimerized with the bromodomain protein tBRD-1. To elucidate the role of the tPlus3a and tPlus3b proteins in transcriptional regulation, we determined the transcriptomes of tplus3a-tplus3b and tbrd-1 deletion mutants using next-generation sequencing (RNA-seq) and compared them to that of the wild-type. tPlus3a and tPlus3b positively or negatively regulated the expression of nearly 400 genes; tBRD-1 regulated 1,500 genes. Nearly 200 genes were regulated by both tPlus3a and tPlus3b and tBRD-1. tPlus3a and tPlus3b activated the Y-chromosomal genes kl-3 and kl-5, which indicates that tPlus3a and tPlus3b proteins are required for the function of distinct classes of genes. tPlus3a and tPlus3b and tBRD-1 repress genes relevant for seminal fluid and heat shock. We hypothesize that tPlus3a and tPlus3b proteins are required to specify the general transcriptional program in spermatocytes.",10.1371/journal.pone.0213177,2019,"Tim Hundertmark, Sabrina Kreutz, Nastasja Merle, Andrea Nist, Boris Lamp, Thorsten Stiewe, Alexander Brehm, Renate Renkawitz-Pohl, Christina Rathke"
20019281,Stepwise modification of a modular enhancer underlies adaptation in a Drosophila population,"The evolution of cis regulatory elements (enhancers) of developmentally regulated genes plays a large role in the evolution of animal morphology. However, the mutational path of enhancer evolution--the number, origin, effect, and order of mutations that alter enhancer function--has not been elucidated. Here, we localized a suite of substitutions in a modular enhancer of the ebony locus responsible for adaptive melanism in a Ugandan Drosophila population. We show that at least five mutations with varied effects arose recently from a combination of standing variation and new mutations and combined to create an allele of large phenotypic effect. We underscore how enhancers are distinct macromolecular entities, subject to fundamentally different, and generally more relaxed, functional constraints relative to protein sequences.",10.1126/science.1178357,2009,"Mark Rebeiz, John E Pool, Victoria A Kassner, Charles F Aquadro, Sean B Carroll"
24972496,Identification of cis-regulatory modules encoding temporal dynamics during development,"Background: Developmental transcriptional regulatory networks are circuits of transcription factors (TFs) and cis-acting DNA elements (Cis Regulatory Modules, CRMs) that dynamically control expression of downstream genes. Comprehensive knowledge of these networks is an essential step towards our understanding of developmental processes. However, this knowledge is mostly based on genome-wide mapping of transcription factor binding sites, and therefore requires prior knowledge regarding the TFs involved in the network. Results: Focusing on how temporal control of gene expression is integrated within a developmental network, we applied an in silico approach to discover regulatory motifs and CRMs of co-expressed genes, with no prior knowledge about the involved TFs. Our aim was to identify regulatory motifs and potential trans-acting factors which regulate the temporal expression of co-expressed gene sets during a particular process of organogenesis, namely adult heart formation in Drosophila. Starting from whole genome tissue specific expression dynamics, we used an in silico method, cisTargetX, to predict TF binding motifs and CRMs. Potential Nuclear Receptor (NR) binding motifs were predicted to control the temporal expression profile of a gene set with increased expression levels during mid metamorphosis. The predicted CRMs and NR motifs were validated in vivo by reporter gene essays. In addition, we provide evidence that three NRs modulate CRM activity and behave as temporal regulators of target enhancers. Conclusions: Our approach was successful in identifying CRMs and potential TFs acting on the temporal regulation of target genes. In addition, our results suggest a modular architecture of the regulatory machinery, in which the temporal and spatial regulation can be uncoupled and encoded by distinct CRMs.",10.1186/1471-2164-15-534,2014,"Delphine Potier, Denis Seyres, CÃ©line Guichard, Magali Iche-Torres, Stein Aerts, Carl Herrmann, Laurent Perrin"

A developmental control element capable of promoting the basic vitelline membrane (VM) expression pattern was found within a 176-bp region. Additional multiple genetic control elements were found to be involved in modifying the level and spatial pattern of reporter gene expression but these required the 176-bp element in order to function. Unexpectedly, in isolation this 176-bp core element also promotes abnormal expression of the reporter gene in border cells of stage 8 and 9 egg chambers.

Earlier work led to the identification of two genes encoding alpha4-type 20S proteasome subunit isoforms that are expressed exclusively in the male germline. Here we extend these results and show that six of the 20S proteasome subunits, and four of the 19S regulatory cap subunits, have gene duplications encoding male-specific isoforms. More detailed analyses of two of these male-specific subunits (Prosalpha3T and Prosalpha6T), using GFP-tagged reporter transgenes, revealed that they are predominantly localized to the nucleus at later stages of spermatogenesis and are present there in mature, motile sperm. These results suggest a possible role of a 'spermatogenesis-specific' proteasome in sperm differentiation and/or function.",10.1046/j.1365-2583.2002.00374.x,2002,"J Ma, E Katz, J M Belote"
2125114,Transcriptional and translational cis-regulatory sequences of the spermatocyte-specific Drosophila janusB gene are located in the 3' exonic region of the overlapping janusA gene,"The janus locus of Drosophila melanogaster displays a very unusual organization. It comprises two partially overlapping genes, janA and janB, which are transcribed in the same orientation; the start of transcription of janB, the downstream gene, is located in the 3' exonic region of janA. Both genes are expressed during spermatogenesis. Transcription of janB is restricted to this developmental process, whereas janA is ubiquitously transcribed in both the somatic and germinal tissues of males and females. In order to delimit the cis-acting sequences regulating the transcription of janB, the expression of four chimeric janB-lacZ genes was examined in transgenic lines by Northern blot analysis, in situ hybridization and in situ histochemical staining for beta-galactosidase activity. Results showed that the testis-specific expression of the janB gene is mediated by a short DNA sequence (positions -174 to +107) which is located entirely within the last exon of the upstream janA gene. The tissue specificity of the expression of the janB gene is maintained when most of the janA coding and upstream sequences are deleted. Yet the presence in cis of an active janA gene leads to reduced accumulation of the janB-lacZ hybrid mRNA. This supports the hypothesis that janA transcription interferes with the function of the janB cis-regulatory elements. Our results also demonstrate that the 5' untranslated leader of the janB mRNA contains translational cis-acting elements, which completely block the translation of the janB-lacZ transcripts during the premeiotic stages of sperm development. A janB-lacZ construct was used to examine the sexual phenotype of the germline cells of masculinized XX transformer-2 (tra-2) flies. This has enabled us to confirm at the molecular level previous observations that the germline cells of these flies can enter the spermatogenic pathway of differentiation.",10.1007/BF00262440,1990,"C Yanicostas, J A Lepesant"
14556285,Specification of motoneuron fate in Drosophila: integration of positive and negative transcription factor inputs by a minimal eve enhancer,"We are interested in the mechanisms that generate neuronal diversity within the Drosophila central nervous system (CNS), and in particular in the development of a single identified motoneuron called RP2. Expression of the homeodomain transcription factor Even-skipped (Eve) is required for RP2 to establish proper connectivity with its muscle target. Here we investigate the mechanisms by which eve is specifically expressed within the RP2 motoneuron lineage. Within the NB4-2 lineage, expression of eve first occurs in the precursor of RP2, called GMC4-2a. We identify a small 500 base pair eve enhancer that mediates eve expression in GMC4-2a. We show that four different transcription factors (Prospero, Huckebein, Fushi tarazu, and Pdm1) are all expressed in GMC4-2a, and are required to activate eve via this minimal enhancer, and that one transcription factor (Klumpfuss) represses eve expression via this element. All four positively acting transcription factors act independently, regulating eve but not each other. Thus, the eve enhancer integrates multiple positive and negative transcription factor inputs to restrict eve expression to a single precursor cell (GMC4-2a) and its RP2 motoneuron progeny.",10.1002/neu.10264,2003,"Jocelyn A McDonald, Miki Fujioka, Joanne P Odden, James B Jaynes, Chris Q Doe"
21807095,Induction of a detoxification gene in Drosophila melanogaster requires an interaction between tissue specific enhancers and a novel cis-regulatory element,"Organisms induce the expression of detoxification enzymes such as cytochrome P450s to deal with xenobiotics encountered in the environment. Research using cell culture systems has identified some of the cis-regulatory elements (CREs) and transcription factors involved in the induction of P450 genes in response to xenobiotic challenges. It was recently found that the CREs required for the basal expression of some P450s are distinct from the CREs involved in their induction. How these CREs mediate induction to xenobiotics in a tissue specific manner is not known. In this paper we show that, in Drosophila melanogaster, the induction response of the P450 gene Cyp6g1 to the xenobiotic Phenobarbital (PB) requires the presence of both tissue specific enhancers and a distinct CRE. The CRE does not drive gene expression but is required for the induction response. Site-directed mutagenesis of sequences within the CRE, sequences similar to mouse PB induction sequences, reduces the level of induction by PB, suggesting some degree of mechanistic conservation between flies and mice. This CRE may represent a unique class of CREs that has no inherent role in the basal transcriptional activity of genes, but is required for induction responses. Variations within this class of CREs may explain the variability of gene induction responses.",10.1016/j.ibmb.2011.07.002,2011,"Henry Chung, Adrian Boey, Chris Lumb, Lee Willoughby, Philip Batterham, Phillip J Daborn"

P-element-mediated transformation and ftz promoter/lacZ fusion genes were used to characterize, in detail, several of these transcriptional control elements. By reconstructing promoters with synthetic oligonucleotides containing cis-regulators of stripe expression, we show that these regulatory sites can function as independent units to direct position-specific transcription in the Drosophila embryo. In particular, we demonstrate that multiple copies of a positive regulatory site can mediate expression in both the odd- and even-numbered parasegments throughout most of the germ band and that negative regulatory sites can transform a continuous pattern of gene expression into discrete stripes.

These experiments enabled us to distinguish separate regulatory elements specific for the different expression domains of fkh. In addition, our analysis revealed several unexpected features such as the redundancy of regulatory elements and the overlap of regulatory elements with the transcribed regions of other genes. Moreover, the separation of normally contiguous elements effecting expression in the posterior terminal fkh domain appears to lead to novel expression domains which do not correspond to known developmental units in the embryo.",,1990,"D Weigel, E Seifert, D Reuter, H JÃ¤ckle"

We report here on the dissection of the regulatory regions for two members of the gene family, Mst84Da and Mst84Db. While high level transcription and negative translational control of Mst84Da is mediated by a short gene segment of 205 nt (-152/+53), Mst84Db expression is controlled by a number of distinct regulatory elements with different effects that all reside within the gene itself. We identify a transcriptional control element between +154 and +216, a translational repression element around +216 to +275 and an RNA stability element within the 3'UTR. Irrespective of the final common expression characteristics, correct regulation for any individual member of the gene family seems to be achieved by very different means. This confirms earlier observations that did not detect any other sequence elements in common apart from the TCE (translational control element).",10.1016/s0925-4773(97)00137-8,1997,"S Gigliotti, V Balz, C Malva, M A SchÃ¤fer"

This specificity was shown to reside in the peculiar regulation of ac and sc expression. These genes are first activated in complementary spatial domains in response to different cis-regulatory sequences. Each gene product then stimulates expression of the other gene, thus generating similar patterns of expression. Therefore, removal of one gene leads to the absence of both proneural gene products and sensory organs in the sites specified by its cis-regulatory sequences.",10.1126/science.1900954,1991,"C MartÃ­nez, J Modolell"

Genome-wide expression profiling demonstrated separation of Cdk8-CycC and Med12-Med13 profiles. However, transcriptional regulation by Cdk8-CycC was dependent on Med12-Med13. This observation also revealed that Cdk8-CycC and Med12-Med13 often have opposite transcriptional effects. Interestingly, Med12 and Med13 profiles overlapped significantly with that of the GATA factor Serpent. Accordingly, mutational analyses indicated that GATA sites are required for Med12-Med13 regulation of Serpent-dependent genes. Med12 and Med13 were also found to be required for Serpent-activated innate immunity genes in defense to bacterial infection.

These results suggest that segmentation proteins can function as Hox cofactors and reveal a previously unanticipated use of compartments for gene regulation by Hox proteins.

We have previously shown that a 200-bp region extending from -120 to +67 relative to the transcription start site is sufficient to obtain eye-specific expression from the ninaE promoter. In the present study, 22 different 4-13-bp sequences in the -120/+67 promoter region were altered by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. Several of these sequences were found to be required for proper promoter function; two of these are conserved in the promoter of the homologous gene isolated from the related species Drosophila virilis. Alteration of a conserved 9-bp sequence results in aberrant, low level expression in the body. Alteration of a separate 11-bp sequence, found in the promoter regions of several photoreceptor-specific genes of Drosophila, results in an approximately 15-fold reduction in promoter efficiency but without apparent alteration of tissue-specificity.

Previous studies in the organism Drosophila melanogaster indicated that as few as three nucleotide differences in the sequences of the U1 and U6 PSEs can play a decisive role in recruiting the different RNA polymerases to transcribe the U1 and U6 snRNA genes in vitro. Those studies utilized constructs that contained only the minimal promoter elements of the U1 and U6 genes in an artificial context. To overcome the limitations of those earlier studies, we have now performed experiments that demonstrate that the Drosophila U1 and U6 PSEs have functionally distinct properties even in the environment of the natural U1 and U6 gene 5'-flanking DNAs. Moreover, assays in cells and in transgenic flies indicate that expression of genes from promoters that contain the ""incorrect"" PSE is suppressed in vivo.

We show a differential requirement for the EY and TOY binding sites in activating so10 during the different stages of eye development. Additionally, in a rescue experiment performed in the so(1) mutant, we show that the EY and TOY binding sites are required for compound eye and ocellus development respectively.

15128668,Notch signaling patterns Drosophila mesodermal segments by regulating the bHLH transcription factor twist,"One of the first steps in embryonic mesodermal differentiation is allocation of cells to particular tissue fates. In Drosophila, this process of mesodermal subdivision requires regulation of the bHLH transcription factor Twist. During subdivision, Twist expression is modulated into stripes of low and high levels within each mesodermal segment. High Twist levels direct cells to the body wall muscle fate, whereas low levels are permissive for gut muscle and fat body fate. We show that Su(H)-mediated Notch signaling represses Twist expression during subdivision and thus plays a critical role in patterning mesodermal segments. Our work demonstrates that Notch acts as a transcriptional switch on mesodermal target genes, and it suggests that Notch/Su(H) directly regulates twist, as well as indirectly regulating twist by activating proteins that repress Twist. We propose that Notch signaling targets two distinct 'Repressors of twist' - the proteins encoded by the Enhancer of split complex [E(spl)C] and the HLH gene extra machrochaetae (emc). Hence, the patterning of Drosophila mesodermal segments relies on Notch signaling changing the activities of a network of bHLH transcriptional regulators, which, in turn, control mesodermal cell fate. Since this same cassette of Notch, Su(H) and bHLH regulators is active during vertebrate mesodermal segmentation and/or subdivision, our work suggests a conserved mechanism for Notch in early mesodermal patterning.",10.1242/dev.01113,2004,"Alexis Tapanes-Castillo, Mary K Baylies"
24465586,A comparison of midline and tracheal gene regulation during Drosophila development,"Within the Drosophila embryo, two related bHLH-PAS proteins, Single-minded and Trachealess, control development of the central nervous system midline and the trachea, respectively. These two proteins are bHLH-PAS transcription factors and independently form heterodimers with another bHLH-PAS protein, Tango. During early embryogenesis, expression of Single-minded is restricted to the midline and Trachealess to the trachea and salivary glands, whereas Tango is ubiquitously expressed. Both Single-minded/Tango and Trachealess/Tango heterodimers bind to the same DNA sequence, called the CNS midline element (CME) within cis-regulatory sequences of downstream target genes. While Single-minded/Tango and Trachealess/Tango activate some of the same genes in their respective tissues during embryogenesis, they also activate a number of different genes restricted to only certain tissues. The goal of this research is to understand how these two related heterodimers bind different enhancers to activate different genes, thereby regulating the development of functionally diverse tissues. Existing data indicates that Single-minded and Trachealess may bind to different co-factors restricted to various tissues, causing them to interact with the CME only within certain sequence contexts. This would lead to the activation of different target genes in different cell types. To understand how the context surrounding the CME is recognized by different bHLH-PAS heterodimers and their co-factors, we identified and analyzed novel enhancers that drive midline and/or tracheal expression and compared them to previously characterized enhancers. In addition, we tested expression of synthetic reporter genes containing the CME flanked by different sequences. Taken together, these experiments identify elements overrepresented within midline and tracheal enhancers and suggest that sequences immediately surrounding a CME help dictate whether a gene is expressed in the midline or trachea.",10.1371/journal.pone.0085518,2014,"Sarah K R Long, Eric Fulkerson, Rebecca Breese, Giovanna Hernandez, Cara Davis, Mark A Melton, Rachana R Chandran, Napoleon Butler, Lan Jiang, Patricia Estes"

Loss of D-Pax2 function leads to loss of Crystallin expression in both eyes and bristles. A 2.3 kilobase (kb) upstream region of the Crystallin gene can drive GFP expression in the eye and is dependent on D-Pax2. In addition, D-Pax2 binds to an evolutionarily conserved site in this region that, by itself, is sufficient to drive GFP expression in the eye. However, mutation of this site does not greatly affect the regulatory region's function.

Key to this strategy is robust expression of enhancer-driven transgenic markers in specific neurons. To this end, we have created vectors to achieve bright and even labeling of neuronal processes, easy cloning of enhancer elements, and efficient and flexible generation of transgenic animals. We provide examples of enhancer-driven membrane markers for specific neurons in both the peripheral and central nervous systems and their applications in the study of neuronal projections and connections in the Drosophila brain. We further applied GEEM to examine the wrapping of sensory neuron somas by glia during embryonic and larval stages, and neuron-glia interaction during dendrite pruning in live animals, leading to the discovery that glia play critical roles in the severing and degradation of proximal dendrites. The GEEM paradigm should be applicable to the studies of both cell-autonomous and nonautonomous regulations of any cell type.",10.1073/pnas.1106386108,2011,"Chun Han, Lily Yeh Jan, Yuh-Nung Jan"
18562695,In vivo dynamics of Drosophila nuclear envelope components,"Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) are multisubunit protein entities embedded into the nuclear envelope (NE). Here, we examine the in vivo dynamics of the essential Drosophila nucleoporin Nup107 and several other NE-associated proteins during NE and NPCs disassembly and reassembly that take place within each mitosis. During both the rapid mitosis of syncytial embryos and the more conventional mitosis of larval neuroblasts, Nup107 is gradually released from the NE, but it remains partially confined to the nuclear (spindle) region up to late prometaphase, in contrast to nucleoporins detected by wheat germ agglutinin and lamins. We provide evidence that in all Drosophila cells, a structure derived from the NE persists throughout metaphase and early anaphase. Finally, we examined the dynamics of the spindle checkpoint proteins Mad2 and Mad1. During mitotic exit, Mad2 and Mad1 are actively imported back from the cytoplasm into the nucleus after the NE and NPCs have reformed, but they reassociate with the NE only later in G1, concomitantly with the recruitment of the basket nucleoporin Mtor (the Drosophila orthologue of vertebrate Tpr). Surprisingly, Drosophila Nup107 shows no evidence of localization to kinetochores, despite the demonstrated importance of this association in mammalian cells.",10.1091/mbc.e07-11-1162,2008,"Katerina R Katsani, Roger E Karess, Nathalie Dostatni, ValÃ©rie Doye"
25660543,Org-1-dependent lineage reprogramming generates the ventral longitudinal musculature of the Drosophila heart,"Only few examples of transdifferentiation, which denotes the conversion of one differentiated cell type to another, are known to occur during normal development, and more often, it is associated with regeneration processes. With respect to muscles, dedifferentiation/redifferentiation processes have been documented during post-traumatic muscle regeneration in blastema of newts as well as during myocardial regeneration. As shown herein, the ventral longitudinal muscles of the adult Drosophila heart arise from specific larval alary muscles in a process that represents the first known example of syncytial muscle transdifferentiation via dedifferentiation into mononucleate myoblasts during normal development. We demonstrate that this unique process depends on the reinitiation of a transcriptional program previously employed for embryonic alary muscle development, in which the factors Org-1 (Drosophila Tbx1) and Tailup (Drosophila Islet1) are key components. During metamorphosis, the action of these factors is combined with cell-autonomous inputs from the ecdysone steroid and the Hox gene Ultrabithorax, which provide temporal and spatial specificity to the transdifferentiation events. Following muscle dedifferentiation, inductive cues, particularly from the remodeling heart tube, are required for the redifferentiation of myoblasts into ventral longitudinal muscles. Our results provide new insights into mechanisms of lineage commitment and cell-fate plasticity during development.",10.1016/j.cub.2014.12.029,2015,"Christoph Schaub, Johannes MÃ¤rz, Ingolf Reim, Manfred Frasch"
20580700,"Genetic interactions of eyes absent, twin of eyeless and orthodenticle regulate sine oculis expression during ocellar development in Drosophila","The homeobox gene sine oculis (so) is required for the development of the entire visual system in Drosophila, which includes the compound eyes, the ocelli, the optic lobe of the brain and the Bolwig's organ. During ocelli development, so expression labels, together with eyes absent (eya), the emergence of the ocellar precursor cells in the third instar eye-antennal disc. Footprinting and misexpression studies have led to the proposal that the Pax6 homologue twin of eyeless (toy) directly regulates the initiation of so expression in ocellar precursor cells. However, so expression in a toy loss-of-function mutant background has not been yet analyzed due to the lack of eye-antennal disc development in strong toy mutant alleles. Using an embryonic eye primordium-specific enhancer of toy, we have rescued the developmental defect of a strong toy mutant allele and analyzed so expression in the ocelli primordium of toy loss-of-function eye-antennal discs during third instar larva. The results show that so expression is only marginally affected in the absence of Toy transcriptional activity and that the toy positive effect on so expression is largely eya-mediated. These results suggest that eya is the main factor controlling both initiation and maintenance of so expression in ocellar precursor cells. In addition, we present the characterization of a new minimal eye/ocellus-specific enhancer of the so gene.",10.1016/j.ydbio.2010.05.494,2010,"Jorge Blanco, Tobias Pauli, Makiko Seimiya, Gerald Udolph, Walter J Gehring"

Recent reports indicate that dysregulation of CDX1 and CDX2, the human homologues of Drosophila caudal, are associated with several types of cancer. Very little is known, however, about the regulatory mechanisms that direct the caudal-related homeobox gene expression. In this study, we have identified the binding sites for bHLH-PAS proteins, referred to as CNS midline element (CME), in the 5'-flanking region of the Drosophila caudal gene. Analyses using transgenic flies carrying a caudal-lacZ fusion gene bearing a wild-type or mutant CME indicate that the CME sites are required for caudal gene expression in vivo. We also determined that the caudal promoter activity can be regulated by Trachealess (Trh)/Tango (Tgo) bHLH-PAS proteins, via the CME sites.

10409512,Cubitus interruptus is necessary but not sufficient for direct activation of a wing-specific decapentaplegic enhancer,"In Drosophila, the imaginal discs are the primordia for adult appendages. Their proper formation is dependent upon the activation of the decapentaplegic (dpp) gene in a stripe of cells just anterior to the compartment boundary. In imaginal discs, the dpp gene has been shown to be activated by Hedgehog signal transduction. However, an initial analysis of its enhancer region suggests that its regulation is complex and depends upon additional factors. In order to understand how multiple factors regulate dpp expression, we chose to focus on a single dpp enhancer element, the dpp heldout enhancer, from the 3' cis regulatory disc region of the dpp locus. In this report, we present a molecular analysis of this 358 bp wing- and haltere-specific dpp enhancer, which demonstrates a direct transcriptional requirement for the Cubitus interruptus (Ci) protein. The results suggest that, in addition to regulation by Ci, expression of the dpp heldout enhancer is spatially determined by Drosophila TCF (dTCF) and the Vestigial/Scalloped selector system and that temporal control is provided by dpp autoregulation. Consistent with the unexpectedly complex regulation of the dpp heldout enhancer, analysis of a Ci consensus site reporter construct suggests that Ci, a mediator of Hedgehog transcriptional activation, can only transactivate in concert with other factors.",,1999,"J Hepker, R K Blackman, R Holmgren"

Dpp is a BMP family ligand and acts via a Smad family DNA-binding transcription factor, Mad. Fat-Hippo signaling acts via a non-DNA-binding transcriptional coactivator protein, Yorkie. Here, we show that these pathways are directly interlinked. They act synergistically to promote growth, in part via regulation of the microRNA gene bantam, and their ability to promote growth is mutually dependent. Yorkie and Mad physically bind each other, and we identify a 410 bp minimal enhancer of bantam that responds to Yorkie:Mad in vivo and in cultured cells, and show that both Yorkie and Mad associate with this enhancer in vivo. Our results indicate that in promoting the growth of Drosophila tissues, Fat-Hippo and Dpp signaling contribute distinct subunits of a shared transcriptional activation complex, Yorkie:Mad.",10.1016/j.devcel.2010.12.002,2011,"Hyangyee Oh, Kenneth D Irvine"

The function of MEF2 was determined by generating a loss-of-function of the single mef2 gene in Drosophila (D-mef2).

We have performed in situ hybridization and transgene experiments that reveal expression of these genes in both gustatory and olfactory neurons in adult flies and larvae. This gene family is likely to encode both odorant and taste receptors. We have visualized the projections of chemosensory neurons in the larval brain and observe that neurons expressing different GRs project to discrete loci in the antennal lobe and subesophageal ganglion.

17360325,Peripheral multidendritic sensory neurons are necessary for rhythmic locomotion behavior in Drosophila larvae,"From breathing to walking, rhythmic movements encompass physiological processes important across the entire animal kingdom. It is thought by many that the generation of rhythmic behavior is operated by a central pattern generator (CPG) and does not require peripheral sensory input. Sensory feedback is, however, required to modify or coordinate the motor activity in response to the circumstances of actual movement. In contrast to this notion, we report here that sensory input is necessary for the generation of Drosophila larval locomotion, a form of rhythmic behavior. Blockage of all peripheral sensory inputs resulted in cessation of larval crawling. By conditionally silencing various subsets of larval peripheral sensory neurons, we identified the multiple dendritic (MD) neurons as the neurons essential for the generation of rhythmic peristaltic locomotion. By recording the locomotive motor activities, we further demonstrate that removal of MD neuron input disrupted rhythmic motor firing pattern in a way that prolonged the stereotyped segmental motor firing duration and prevented the propagation of posterior to anterior segmental motor firing. These findings reveal that MD sensory neuron input is a necessary component in the neural circuitry that generates larval locomotion.",10.1073/pnas.0700895104,2007,"Wei Song, Maika Onishi, Lily Yeh Jan, Yuh Nung Jan"
15469973,Specification of Drosophila motoneuron identity by the combinatorial action of POU and LIM-HD factors,"In both vertebrates and invertebrates, members of the LIM-homeodomain (LIM-HD) family of transcription factors act in combinatorial codes to specify motoneuron subclass identities. In the developing Drosophila embryo, the LIM-HD factors Islet (Tailup) and Lim3, specify the set of motoneuron subclasses that innervate ventral muscle targets. However, as several subclasses express both Islet and Lim3, this combinatorial code alone cannot explain how these motoneuron groups are further differentiated. To identify additional factors that may act to refine this LIM-HD code, we have analyzed the expression of POU genes in the Drosophila embryonic nerve cord. We find that the class III POU protein, Drifter (Ventral veinless), is co-expressed with Islet and Lim3 specifically in the ISNb motoneuron subclass. Loss-of-function and misexpression studies demonstrate that the LIM-HD combinatorial code requires Drifter to confer target specificity between the ISNb and TN motoneuron subclasses. To begin to elucidate molecules downstream of the LIM-HD code, we examined the involvement of the Beaten path (Beat) family of immunoglobulin-containing cell-adhesion molecules. We find that beat Ic genetically interacts with islet and Lim3 in the TN motoneuron subclass and can also rescue the TN fasciculation defects observed in islet and Lim3 mutants. These results suggest that in the TN motoneuron context, Islet and Lim3 may specify axon target selection through the actions of IgSF call-adhesion molecules.",10.1242/dev.01418,2004,"Sarah J Certel, Stefan Thor"
9716725,Dissection of cis-regulatory elements of the Drosophila gene Serrate,"The Drosophila gene Serrate encodes a membrane spanning protein, which is expressed in a complex pattern during embryogenesis and larval stages. Loss of Serrate function leads to larval lethality, which is associated with several morphogenetic defects, including the failure to develop wings and halteres. Serrate has been suggested to act as a short-range signal during wing development. It is required for the induction of the organising centre at the dorsal/ventral compartment boundary, from which growth and patterning of the wing is controlled. In order to understand the regulatory network required to control the spatially and temporally dynamic expression of Serrate, we analysed its cis-regulatory elements by fusing various genomic fragments upstream of the reporter gene lacZ. Enhancer elements reflecting the expression pattern of endogenous Serrate in embryonic and postembryonic tissues could be confined to 26 kb of genomic DNA, including 9 kb of transcribed region. Expression in some embryonic tissues is under the control of multiple enhancers located in the 5' region and in intron sequences.

A candidate for interaction with Trh is Drifter/Ventral veinless, a POU-domain protein. A dual requirement for Trh and Drifter was identified for the autoregulation of Trh and Drifter expression. Furthermore, ectopic expression of both Trh and Dfr (but not each one alone) triggered trh autoregulation in several embryonic tissues.

20637846,"Evolution of expression patterns of two odorant-binding protein genes, Obp57d and Obp57e, in Drosophila","Odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) function in the perception of chemical signals together with odorant and taste receptors. Genes encoding OBPs form a large family in insect genomes. In Drosophila, the evolution of OBP gene repertoire has been well studied by comparisons of the whole genome sequences from 12 closely related species. In contrast, their expression patterns are known only in Drosophila melanogaster. Two OBP genes, Obp57d and Obp57e, arose by gene duplication at the early stage of D. melanogaster species group evolution, followed by the divergence of open reading frame (ORF) sequences from each other. While most species in the melanogaster group maintain both Obp57d and Obp57e, some species have lost either gene, suggesting that the birth-and-death process is a dominating pattern of evolution at the Obp57d/e locus. However, it has not been explored whether the expression patterns of these two OBP genes are diverged or conserved among species. Here, we examined the expression patterns of Obp57d and Obp57e in the selected species from the melanogaster group using a combination of reporter analysis, RNA in situ hybridization, and quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis. As previously reported for D. melanogaster, expression in the chemosensilla on the legs was observed in all the species examined. Unlike in D. melnanogaster, however, additional expression in the chemosensilla on the mouthparts was observed in some species including Drosophila pseudoobscura, which maintains an ancestral OBP gene at the Obp57d/e locus. This result shows that, as well as their ORF sequences, the expression patterns of Obp57d and Obp57e have diverged substantially between closely related Drosophila species.",10.1016/j.gene.2010.07.006,2010,"Jyunichiro Yasukawa, Sachiko Tomioka, Toshiro Aigaki, Takashi Matsuo"
28715438,A sequence level model of an intact locus predicts the location and function of nonadditive enhancers,"Metazoan gene expression is controlled through the action of long stretches of noncoding DNA that contain enhancers-shorter sequences responsible for controlling a single aspect of a gene's expression pattern. Models built on thermodynamics have shown how enhancers interpret protein concentration in order to determine specific levels of gene expression, but the emergent regulatory logic of a complete regulatory locus shows qualitative and quantitative differences from isolated enhancers. Such differences may arise from steric competition limiting the quantity of DNA that can simultaneously influence the transcription machinery. We incorporated this competition into a mechanistic model of gene regulation, generated efficient algorithms for this computation, and applied it to the regulation of Drosophila even-skipped (eve). This model finds the location of enhancers and identifies which factors control the boundaries of eve expression. This model predicts a new enhancer that, when assayed in vivo, drives expression in a non-eve pattern. Incorporation of chromatin accessibility eliminates this inconsistency.",10.1371/journal.pone.0180861,2017,"Kenneth A Barr, John Reinitz"
12571107,A discrete transcriptional silencer in the bam gene determines asymmetric division of the Drosophila germline stem cell,"The Drosophila germline lineage depends on a complex microenvironment of extrinsic and intrinsic factors that regulate the self-renewing and asymmetric divisions of dedicated stem cells. Germline stem cells (GSCs) must express components of the Dpp cassette and the translational repressors Nanos and Pumilio, whereas cystoblasts require the bam and bgcn genes. Bam is especially attractive as a target of GSC differentiation factors because current evidence indicates that bam is both necessary and sufficient for cystoblast differentiation. In this paper, we have sought to distinguish between mutually exclusive transcriptional or post-transcriptional mechanisms as the primary regulators of bam expression in GSCs and cystoblasts. We find that bam transcription is active in young germ cells but is repressed specifically in GSCs. Activation depends on a 50 bp fragment that carries at least one germ cell-specific enhancer element. A non-overlapping 18 bp sequence carries a transcriptional silencer that prevents bam expression in the GSC. Promoters lacking this silencer cause bam expression in the GSC and concomitant GSC loss. Thus, asymmetry of the GSC division can be reduced to identifying the mechanism that selectively activates the silencer element in GSCs.",10.1242/dev.00325,2003,"Dahua Chen, Dennis M McKearin"

CHIBBY (CBY) is a coiled-coil domain protein first described as interacting with Î²-catenin and involved in Wg-Int (WNT) signaling. We found that, in Drosophila melanogaster, CBY was exclusively expressed in cells that require functional basal bodies, i.e., sensory neurons and male germ cells. CBY was associated with the basal body transition zone (TZ) in these two cell types. Inactivation of cby led to defects in sensory transduction and in spermatogenesis. Loss of CBY resulted in altered ciliary trafficking into neuronal cilia, irregular deposition of proteins on spermatocyte basal bodies, and, consequently, distorted axonemal assembly. Importantly, cby(1/1) flies did not show Wingless signaling defects. Hence, CBY is essential for normal basal body structure and function in Drosophila, potentially through effects on the TZ.

In this study, regulatory specificity was investigated by dissecting the genetic and molecular requirements that allow the Hox protein Abdominal A to activate wingless in only a few cells of its broad expression domain in the Drosophila visceral mesoderm. We show that the Dpp/Tgfbeta signal controls Abdominal A function, and that Hox protein and signal-activated regulators converge on a wingless enhancer.

25835988,The evolutionary origination and diversification of a dimorphic gene regulatory network through parallel innovations in cis and trans,"The origination and diversification of morphological characteristics represents a key problem in understanding the evolution of development. Morphological traits result from gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that form a web of transcription factors, which regulate multiple cis-regulatory element (CRE) sequences to control the coordinated expression of differentiation genes. The formation and modification of GRNs must ultimately be understood at the level of individual regulatory linkages (i.e., transcription factor binding sites within CREs) that constitute the network. Here, we investigate how elements within a network originated and diversified to generate a broad range of abdominal pigmentation phenotypes among Sophophora fruit flies. Our data indicates that the coordinated expression of two melanin synthesis enzymes, Yellow and Tan, recently evolved through novel CRE activities that respond to the spatial patterning inputs of Hox proteins and the sex-specific input of Bric-Ã -brac transcription factors. Once established, it seems that these newly evolved activities were repeatedly modified by evolutionary changes in the network's trans-regulators to generate large-scale changes in pigment pattern. By elucidating how yellow and tan are connected to the web of abdominal trans-regulators, we discovered that the yellow and tan abdominal CREs are composed of distinct regulatory inputs that exhibit contrasting responses to the same Hox proteins and Hox cofactors. These results provide an example in which CRE origination underlies a recently evolved novel trait, and highlights how coordinated expression patterns can evolve in parallel through the generation of unique regulatory linkages.",10.1371/journal.pgen.1005136,2015,"Eric M Camino, John C Butts, Alison Ordway, Jordan E Vellky, Mark Rebeiz, Thomas M Williams"

We investigate this relationship for the well-studied Twist factor in Drosophila melanogaster embryos by analyzing genome-wide factor occupancy and testing the functional significance of Twist occupied regions and motifs within regions. Twist ChIP-seq data efficiently identified previously studied Twist-dependent CRMs and robustly predicted new CRM activity in transgenesis, with newly identified Twist-occupied regions supporting diverse spatiotemporal patterns (>74% positive, n = 31). Some, but not all, candidate CRMs require Twist for proper expression in the embryo. The Twist motifs most favored in genome ChIP data (in vivo) differed from those most favored by Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential enrichment (SELEX) (in vitro). Furthermore, the majority of ChIP-seq signals could be parsimoniously explained by a CABVTG motif located within 50 bp of the ChIP summit and, of these, CACATG was most prevalent. Mutagenesis experiments demonstrated that different Twist E-box motif types are not fully interchangeable, suggesting that the ChIP-derived consensus (CABVTG) includes sites having distinct regulatory outputs. Further analysis of position, frequency of occurrence, and sequence conservation revealed significant enrichment and conservation of CABVTG E-box motifs near Twist ChIP-seq signal summits, preferential conservation of Â±150 bp surrounding Twist occupied summits, and enrichment of GA- and CA-repeat sequences near Twist occupied summits.

This specific, ubiquitous, and continuous pattern of neural expression has led to the increasingly popular use of ELAV protein as a neural-specific marker. To understand the molecular basis of this neural-specific expression, we have defined and analyzed the structure of the elav promoter. Cis-acting sequences important for conferring the neural specificity of elav expression were identified by analyzing the reporter gene expression in transformants carrying different elav-beta-galactosidase fusion genes. This analysis delimits a 333-bp region (-92 to +241) that is necessary for specifying the elav pattern of nervous system expression.

21151964,Nomadic enhancers: tissue-specific cis-regulatory elements of yellow have divergent genomic positions among Drosophila species,"cis-regulatory DNA sequences known as enhancers control gene expression in space and time. They are central to metazoan development and are often responsible for changes in gene regulation that contribute to phenotypic evolution. Here, we examine the sequence, function, and genomic location of enhancers controlling tissue- and cell-type specific expression of the yellow gene in six Drosophila species. yellow is required for the production of dark pigment, and its expression has evolved largely in concert with divergent pigment patterns. Using Drosophila melanogaster as a transgenic host, we examined the expression of reporter genes in which either 5' intergenic or intronic sequences of yellow from each species controlled the expression of Green Fluorescent Protein. Surprisingly, we found that sequences controlling expression in the wing veins, as well as sequences controlling expression in epidermal cells of the abdomen, thorax, and wing, were located in different genomic regions in different species. By contrast, sequences controlling expression in bristle-associated cells were located in the intron of all species. Differences in the precise pattern of spatial expression within the developing epidermis of D. melanogaster transformants usually correlated with adult pigmentation in the species from which the cis-regulatory sequences were derived, which is consistent with cis-regulatory evolution affecting yellow expression playing a central role in Drosophila pigmentation divergence. Sequence comparisons among species favored a model in which sequential nucleotide substitutions were responsible for the observed changes in cis-regulatory architecture. Taken together, these data demonstrate frequent changes in yellow cis-regulatory architecture among Drosophila species. Similar analyses of other genes, combining in vivo functional tests of enhancer activity with in silico comparative genomics, are needed to determine whether the pattern of regulatory evolution we observed for yellow is characteristic of genes with rapidly evolving expression patterns.",10.1371/journal.pgen.1001222,2010,"Gizem Kalay, Patricia J Wittkopp"
8674417,Distinct mitogenic and cell fate specification functions of wingless in different regions of the wing,"Patterning and proliferation are coordinately controlled in the development of Drosophila imaginal discs. Localized expression of decapentaplegic (dpp) at the anterior-posterior and wingless (wg) at the dorsal-ventral compartment boundaries controls growth of the wing with respect to the A/P and D/V axes. The growth-promoting effects of these organizers are thought to be indirect, since growth is dispersed throughout the disc, and is not localized near the sources of wg or dpp. wg has also been implicated in proximal-distal patterning of the wing hinge. In this report, we present evidence that wg is principally required for local cell proliferation in the hinge. Loss of wg expression leads to a local reduction in cell division, resulting in the deletion of a distinct set of wing hinge structures. Ectopic activation of the wg pathway in cells of the wing hinge leads to overproliferation without repatterning, indicating that wg acts as a mitogen in this part of the disc. By contrast, overexpression of wg in the wing blade leads to repatterning and only secondarily to proliferation. These results suggest that the Wg signal elicits very different responses in different regions of the wing imaginal disc.",,1996,"C J Neumann, S M Cohen"

In order to assess the intranuclear distribution of PC during mitosis in different developmental stages as well as in the germ line we generated transgenic fly lines expressing a PC-GFP (Green Fluorescent Protein) fusion protein. Rapidly dividing nuclei were found to display a rather homogeneous PC-GFP distribution. However, with increasing differentiation a pronounced subnuclear pattern was observed. In all investigated diploid somatic tissues the bulk of PC-GFP fusion protein is depleted from the chromosomes during mitosis: however, a detectable fraction remains associated. In the male germ line in early spermatogenesis, PC-GFP was closely associated with the chromosomal bivalents and gradually lost at later stages. Interestingly, we found that PC is associated with the nucleolus in spermatocytes, unlike somatic nuclei.

10839367,Drosophila CRY is a deep brain circadian photoreceptor,"cry (cryptochrome) is an important clock gene, and recent data indicate that it encodes a critical circadian photoreceptor in Drosophila. A mutant allele, cry(b), inhibits circadian photoresponses. Restricting CRY expression to specific fly tissues shows that CRY expression is needed in a cell-autonomous fashion for oscillators present in different locations. CRY overexpression in brain pacemaker cells increases behavioral photosensitivity, and this restricted CRY expression also rescues all circadian defects of cry(b) behavior. As wild-type pacemaker neurons express CRY, the results indicate that they make a striking contribution to all aspects of behavioral circadian rhythms and are directly light responsive. These brain neurons therefore contain an identified deep brain photoreceptor, as well as the other circadian elements: a central pace-maker and a behavioral output system.",10.1016/s0896-6273(00)81181-2,2000,"P Emery, R Stanewsky, C Helfrich-FÃ¶rster, M Emery-Le, J C Hall, M Rosbash"
7905482,Repression of regulatory factor for Drosophila DNA replication-related gene promoters by zerknÃ¼llt homeodomain protein,"The expression of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene under control of the 1152-base pair 5'-flanking region (-1107 to +45 nucleotide positions with respect to the major transcription initiation site) of the Drosophila DNA polymerase alpha gene was repressed by cotransfection into Drosophila Kc cells with a zerknÃ¼llt (zen)-expressing plasmid as previously observed with the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) gene promoter. The expression of the zen resulted in reduction of the abundance of mRNA for the transfected chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene and also mRNAs for both DNA polymerase alpha and PCNA. Results obtained using various deletion derivatives of the promoter region and chemically synthesized oligonucleotides of the DNA replication-related element (DRE), a positive cis-acting element found in both DNA polymerase alpha and PCNA genes, revealed that the DRE sequences are responsible to repression by Zen protein. The nuclear extract of Kc cells transfected by the zen-expressing plasmid contained lesser amounts of the DRE-binding factor (DREF) than that of untransfected or mutant zen-transfected cells. These results suggest that the Zen protein represses expression of DNA replication-related genes by reducing DREF, although the detailed mechanism of the repression remains to be elucidated.",,1994,"F Hirose, M Yamaguchi, A Matsukage"
15699212,Live imaging of wound inflammation in Drosophila embryos reveals key roles for small GTPases during in vivo cell migration,"Aa robust inflammatory response to tissue damage and infection is conserved across almost all animal phyla. Neutrophils and macrophages, or their equivalents, are drawn to the wound site where they engulf cell and matrix debris and release signals that direct components of the repair process. This orchestrated cell migration is clinically important, and yet, to date, leukocyte chemotaxis has largely been studied in vitro. Here, we describe a genetically tractable in vivo wound model of inflammation in the Drosophila melanogaster embryo that is amenable to cinemicroscopy. For the first time, we are able to examine the roles of Rho-family small GTPases during inflammation in vivo and show that Rac-mediated lamellae are essential for hemocyte motility and Rho signaling is necessary for cells to retract from sites of matrix- and cell-cell contacts. Cdc42 is necessary for maintaining cellular polarity and yet, despite in vitro evidence, is dispensable for sensing and crawling toward wound cues.",10.1083/jcb.200405120,2005,"Brian Stramer, Will Wood, Michael J Galko, Michael J Redd, Antonio Jacinto, Susan M Parkhurst, Paul Martin"
19150446,Identification of the Drosophila Mes4 gene as a novel target of the transcription factor DREF,"The Mes4 gene has been identified as one of the maternal Dorsal target genes in Drosophila. In the present study, we found a DNA replication-related element (DRE, 5'-TATCGATA) in the Mes4 promoter recognized by the DRE-binding factor (DREF). Luciferase transient expression assays in S2 cells using Mes4 promoter-luciferase fusion plasmids revealed that the DRE sequence is essential for Mes4 promoter activity. Requirement of DRE for Mes4 promoter activity was further confirmed by anti-beta-galactosidase antibody-staining of various tissues from transgenic flies carrying Mes4 promoter-lacZ fusion genes. Furthermore, wild type Mes4 promoter activity was decreased by 40% in DREF-depleted S2 cells. These results indicate that DREF positively regulates Mes4 gene expression. Band mobility shift analyses using Kc cell nuclear extracts further indicated that the DRE sequence in the Mes4 promoter is especially important for binding to DREF. Moreover, specific binding of DREF to the involved genomic region could be demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays using anti-DREF antibodies. These results, taken together, indicate that the DRE/DREF system activates transcription of the Mes4 gene. In addition, knockdown of the Mes4 gene in wing imaginal discs using the GAL4-UAS system caused an atrophied wing phenotype, suggesting that Mes4 is required for wing morphogenesis.",10.1016/j.yexcr.2008.12.017,2009,"Osamu Suyari, Hiroyuki Ida, Yasuhide Yoshioka, Yasuko Kato, Reina Hashimoto, Masamitsu Yamaguchi"
25609699,Enhancer modeling uncovers transcriptional signatures of individual cardiac cell states in Drosophila,"Here we used discriminative training methods to uncover the chromatin, transcription factor (TF) binding and sequence features of enhancers underlying gene expression in individual cardiac cells. We used machine learning with TF motifs and ChIP data for a core set of cardiogenic TFs and histone modifications to classify Drosophila cell-type-specific cardiac enhancer activity. We show that the classifier models can be used to predict cardiac cell subtype cis-regulatory activities. Associating the predicted enhancers with an expression atlas of cardiac genes further uncovered clusters of genes with transcription and function limited to individual cardiac cell subtypes. Further, the cell-specific enhancer models revealed chromatin, TF binding and sequence features that distinguish enhancer activities in distinct subsets of heart cells. Collectively, our results show that computational modeling combined with empirical testing provides a powerful platform to uncover the enhancers, TF motifs and gene expression profiles which characterize individual cardiac cell fates.",10.1093/nar/gkv011,2015,"Brian W Busser, Julian Haimovich, Di Huang, Ivan Ovcharenko, Alan M Michelson"
12004130,Ablation of insulin-producing neurons in flies: growth and diabetic phenotypes,"In the fruit fly Drosophila, four insulin genes are coexpressed in small clusters of cells [insulin-producing cells (IPCs)] in the brain. Here, we show that ablation of these IPCs causes developmental delay, growth retardation, and elevated carbohydrate levels in larval hemolymph. All of the defects were reversed by ectopic expression of a Drosophila insulin transgene. On the basis of these functional data and the observation that IPCs release insulin into the circulatory system, we conclude that brain IPCs are the main systemic supply of insulin during larval growth. We propose that IPCs and pancreatic islet beta cells are functionally analogous and may have evolved from a common ancestral insulin-producing neuron. Interestingly, the phenotype of flies lacking IPCs includes certain features of diabetes mellitus.",10.1126/science.1070058,2002,"Eric J Rulifson, Seung K Kim, Roel Nusse"
9311990,KrÃ¼ppel target gene knockout participates in the proper innervation of a specific set of Drosophila larval muscles,"KrÃ¼ppel (Kr) encodes a zinc finger-type transcription factor expressed in spatially and temporally restricted patterns during Drosophila embryogenesis. Molecular targets and the mechanism of Kr action have been studied extensively during the early segmentation process, but only little is known about Kr requirement during later development. We report the identification of a target gene of Kr, termed knockout (ko), isolated by virtue of KrÃ¼ppel in vitro binding sites. Loss and gain of function experiments show that Kr activity maintains ko expression in a subset of muscles. ko encodes a novel protein expressed in several embryonic tissues including Kr-expressing muscles. Movements of embryos deficient for ko activity are uncoordinated. Their muscle pattern is normal, but the patterns of neuromuscular innervation are specifically disarranged. The results suggest that the Kr target gene ko is required for proper innervation of specific muscles by RP motoneurons.",10.1093/emboj/16.17.5299,1997,"C Hartmann, M Landgraf, M Bate, H JÃ¤ckle"
15737936,Genetic programs activated by proneural proteins in the developing Drosophila PNS,"Neurogenesis depends on a family of proneural transcriptional activator proteins, but the ""proneural"" function of these factors is poorly understood, in part because the ensemble of genes they activate, directly or indirectly, has not been identified systematically. We have taken a direct approach to this problem in Drosophila. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting was used to recover a purified population of the cells that comprise the ""proneural clusters"" from which sensory organ precursors of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) arise. Whole-genome microarray analysis and in situ hybridization was then used to identify and verify a set of genes that are preferentially expressed in proneural cluster cells. Genes in this set encode proteins with a diverse array of implied functions, and loss-of-function analysis of two candidate genes shows that they are indeed required for normal PNS development. Bioinformatic and reporter gene studies further illuminate the cis-regulatory codes that direct expression in proneural clusters.",10.1016/j.devcel.2005.01.020,2005,"Nick Reeves, James W Posakony"
11051549,Combinatorial signaling in the specification of unique cell fates,"How multifunctional signals combine to specify unique cell fates during pattern formation is not well understood. Here, we demonstrate that together with the transcription factor Lozenge, the nuclear effectors of the EGFR and Notch signaling pathways directly regulate D-Pax2 transcription in cone cells of the Drosophila eye disc. Moreover, the specificity of D-Pax2 expression can be altered upon genetic manipulation of these inputs. Thus, a relatively small number of temporally and spatially controlled signals received by a set of pluripotent cells can create the unique combinations of activated transcription factors required to regulate target genes and ultimately specify distinct cell fates within this group. We expect that similar mechanisms may specify pattern formation in vertebrate developmental systems that involve intercellular communication.",10.1016/s0092-8674(00)00106-9,2000,"G V Flores, H Duan, H Yan, R Nagaraj, W Fu, Y Zou, M Noll, U Banerjee"
15340490,Transcriptional control in the segmentation gene network of Drosophila,"The segmentation gene network of Drosophila consists of maternal and zygotic factors that generate, by transcriptional (cross-) regulation, expression patterns of increasing complexity along the anterior-posterior axis of the embryo. Using known binding site information for maternal and zygotic gap transcription factors, the computer algorithm Ahab recovers known segmentation control elements (modules) with excellent success and predicts many novel modules within the network and genome-wide. We show that novel module predictions are highly enriched in the network and typically clustered proximal to the promoter, not only upstream, but also in intronic space and downstream. When placed upstream of a reporter gene, they consistently drive patterned blastoderm expression, in most cases faithfully producing one or more pattern elements of the endogenous gene. Moreover, we demonstrate for the entire set of known and newly validated modules that Ahab's prediction of binding sites correlates well with the expression patterns produced by the modules, revealing basic rules governing their composition. Specifically, we show that maternal factors consistently act as activators and that gap factors act as repressors, except for the bimodal factor Hunchback. Our data suggest a simple context-dependent rule for its switch from repressive to activating function. Overall, the composition of modules appears well fitted to the spatiotemporal distribution of their positive and negative input factors. Finally, by comparing Ahab predictions with different categories of transcription factor input, we confirm the global regulatory structure of the segmentation gene network, but find odd skipped behaving like a primary pair-rule gene. The study expands our knowledge of the segmentation gene network by increasing the number of experimentally tested modules by 50%. For the first time, the entire set of validated modules is analyzed for binding site composition under a uniform set of criteria, permitting the definition of basic composition rules. The study demonstrates that computational methods are a powerful complement to experimental approaches in the analysis of transcription networks.",10.1371/journal.pbio.0020271,2004,"Mark D Schroeder, Michael Pearce, John Fak, HongQing Fan, Ulrich Unnerstall, Eldon Emberly, Nikolaus Rajewsky, Eric D Siggia, Ulrike Gaul"
16477641,"In Drosophila, don juan and don juan like encode proteins of the spermatid nucleus and the flagellum and both are regulated at the transcriptional level by the TAF II80 cannonball while translational repression is achieved by distinct elements","The genes don juan (dj) and don juan like (djl) encode basic proteins expressed in the male germline. Both proteins show a similar expression pattern being localized in the sperm heads during chromatin condensation and along the flagella. Prematurely expressed Don Juan-eGFP and Myc-Don Juan Like localize to the cytoplasm of spermatocytes and in mitochondrial derivatives from the nebenkern stage onward suggesting that both proteins associate with the mitochondria along the flagella in elongated spermatids. Premature expression of Myc-Don Juan Like does not impair spermatogenesis where-as Don Juan-eGFP when prematurely expressed causes male sterility as spermatids fail to individualize. In spite of the sequence identity of 72% on the nucleotide level and 42% on the protein level, the presumptive promoter regions and the untranslated regions of the mRNA are diverged. Our in vivo analysis revealed that don juan and don juan like are transcriptionally and translationally controlled by distinct short cis regulatory regions. Transcription of don juan and don juan like depends on the male germ line specific TAF(II)80, Cannonball (Can). Translational repression elements for both mRNAs are localized in the 5' UTR and are capable to form distinct secondary structures in close proximity to the translational initiation codon.",10.1002/dvdy.20698,2006,"Leonie U Hempel, Christina Rathke, Sunil Jayaramaiah Raja, Renate Renkawitz-Pohl"
24039600,Divergent transcriptional regulatory logic at the intersection of tissue growth and developmental patterning,"The Yorkie/Yap transcriptional coactivator is a well-known regulator of cellular proliferation in both invertebrates and mammals. As a coactivator, Yorkie (Yki) lacks a DNA binding domain and must partner with sequence-specific DNA binding proteins in the nucleus to regulate gene expression; in Drosophila, the developmental regulators Scalloped (Sd) and Homothorax (Hth) are two such partners. To determine the range of target genes regulated by these three transcription factors, we performed genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments for each factor in both the wing and eye-antenna imaginal discs. Strong, tissue-specific binding patterns are observed for Sd and Hth, while Yki binding is remarkably similar across both tissues. Binding events common to the eye and wing are also present for Sd and Hth; these are associated with genes regulating cell proliferation and ""housekeeping"" functions, and account for the majority of Yki binding. In contrast, tissue-specific binding events for Sd and Hth significantly overlap enhancers that are active in the given tissue, are enriched in Sd and Hth DNA binding sites, respectively, and are associated with genes that are consistent with each factor's previously established tissue-specific functions. Tissue-specific binding events are also significantly associated with Polycomb targeted chromatin domains. To provide mechanistic insights into tissue-specific regulation, we identify and characterize eye and wing enhancers of the Yki-targeted bantam microRNA gene and demonstrate that they are dependent on direct binding by Hth and Sd, respectively. Overall these results suggest that both Sd and Hth use distinct strategies - one shared between tissues and associated with Yki, the other tissue-specific, generally Yki-independent and associated with developmental patterning - to regulate distinct gene sets during development.",10.1371/journal.pgen.1003753,2013,"Matthew Slattery, Roumen Voutev, Lijia Ma, Nicolas NÃ¨gre, Kevin P White, Richard S Mann"
29884674,In locus analysis of patterning evolution of the BMP type II receptor Wishful thinking,"Proper tissue patterning is an essential step during organ formation. During this process, genes are expressed in distinct patterns, defining boundaries for future functional domains. The bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway sets the anterior domain during eggshell patterning. Previously, the Drosophila melanogaster homolog of BMPR2, Wishful thinking (WIT), was shown to be required for BMP signaling and patterning during eggshell formation. Expressed in a conserved anterior pattern, the width of wit patterning in the follicular epithelium is evolutionarily divergent between Drosophila species. We used genome editing to demonstrate how the gene pattern divergence is controlled in cis within the wit locus of D. virilis Furthermore, unlike direct targets of BMP signaling, we demonstrate how one transcription factor binding site shapes the pattern of WIT in D. melanogaster by negative regulation. However, changes in this site are not sufficient to explain the evolution of wit patterning, suggesting that a positive regulatory element that controls pattern divergence remains to be discovered.",10.1242/dev.161083,2018,"Robert A Marmion, Nir Yakoby"
20512118,Phenotypic robustness conferred by apparently redundant transcriptional enhancers,"Genes include cis-regulatory regions that contain transcriptional enhancers. Recent reports have shown that developmental genes often possess multiple discrete enhancer modules that drive transcription in similar spatio-temporal patterns: primary enhancers located near the basal promoter and secondary, or 'shadow', enhancers located at more remote positions. It has been proposed that the seemingly redundant activity of primary and secondary enhancers contributes to phenotypic robustness. We tested this hypothesis by generating a deficiency that removes two newly discovered enhancers of shavenbaby (svb, a transcript of the ovo locus), a gene encoding a transcription factor that directs development of Drosophila larval trichomes. At optimal temperatures for embryonic development, this deficiency causes minor defects in trichome patterning. In embryos that develop at both low and high extreme temperatures, however, absence of these secondary enhancers leads to extensive loss of trichomes. These temperature-dependent defects can be rescued by a transgene carrying a secondary enhancer driving transcription of the svb cDNA. Finally, removal of one copy of wingless, a gene required for normal trichome patterning, causes a similar loss of trichomes only in flies lacking the secondary enhancers. These results support the hypothesis that secondary enhancers contribute to phenotypic robustness in the face of environmental and genetic variability.",10.1038/nature09158,2010,"NicolÃ¡s Frankel, Gregory K Davis, Diego Vargas, Shu Wang, FranÃ§ois Payre, David L Stern"
7590239,Suppressor of hairless directly activates transcription of enhancer of split complex genes in response to Notch receptor activity,"We have investigated the functional relationships among three loci that are required for multiple alternative cell fate decisions during adult peripheral neurogenesis in Drosophila: Notch (N), which encodes a transmembrane receptor protein, Suppressor of Hairless [Su(H)], which encodes a DNA-binding transcription factor, and the Enhancer of split gene complex [E(spl)-C], which includes seven transcription units that encode basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) repressor proteins. We describe several lines of evidence establishing that Su(H) directly activates transcription of E(spl)-C genes in response to N receptor activity. Expression of an activated form of the N receptor leads to elevated and ectopic E(spl)-C transcript accumulation and promoter activity in imaginal discs. We show that the proximal upstream regions of three E(spl)-C genes contain multiple specific binding sites for Su(H). The integrity of these sites, as well as Su(H) gene activity, are required not only for normal levels of expression of E(spl)-C genes in imaginal disc proneural clusters, but also for their transcriptional response to hyperactivity of the N receptor. Our results establish Su(H) as a direct regulatory link between N receptor activity and the expression of E(spl)-C genes, extending the known linear structure of the N cell-cell signaling pathway.",10.1101/gad.9.21.2609,1995,"A M Bailey, J W Posakony"
8887679,Regulation of the EDG84A gene by FTZ-F1 during metamorphosis in Drosophila melanogaster,"The transcription factor FTZ-F1 is a member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily and is transiently expressed during the mid- and late prepupal periods in Drosophila melanogaster. A putative pupal cuticle gene, EDG84A, is expressed slightly following FTZ-F1 expression during the prepupal period and carries a strong FTZ-F1 binding site between bases 100 and 92 upstream of its transcription start site. In this study, EDG84A mRNA was found to be prematurely expressed upon heat induction of FTZ-F1 in prepupae carrying the heat shock promoter-FTZ-F1 cDNA fusion gene construct. Transgenic fly lines having the 0.8-kb region of the EDG84A promoter fused to lacZ expressed the reporter gene in a tissue- and stage-specific manner. Base substitutions in the FTZ-F1 binding site within the 0.8-kb promoter abolished expression of lacZ. These results strongly suggest that the EDG84A gene is a direct target of FTZ-F1. Deletion studies of the cis-regulatory region of the EDG84A gene revealed that space-specific expression in imaginal disc-derived epidermis is controlled by the region between bp -408 and -104 from the transcription start site. The region between bp -408 and -194 is necessary to repress expression in a posterior part of the body, while the region between bp -193 and -104 carries a positive element for activation in an anterior part of the body. These results suggest that FTZ-F1 governs expression of the EDG84A gene in conjunction with putative tissue-specific regulators.",10.1128/mcb.16.11.6509,1996,"T Murata, Y Kageyama, S Hirose, H Ueda"

Olfactory conditioning in Drosophila requires direct dopamine action on intrinsic mushroom body neurons, the likely storage sites of olfactory memories. Neither the cellular sources of the conditioning dopamine nor its precise postsynaptic targets are known. By optically controlling genetically circumscribed subsets of dopaminergic neurons in the behaving fly, we have mapped the origin of aversive reinforcement signals to the PPL1 cluster of 12 dopaminergic cells. PPL1 projections target restricted domains in the vertical lobes and heel of the mushroom body. Artificially evoked activity in a small number of identifiable cells thus suffices for programming behaviorally meaningful memories.

7590238,The neurogenic suppressor of hairless DNA-binding protein mediates the transcriptional activation of the enhancer of split complex genes triggered by Notch signaling,"The Notch protein (N) acts as a transmembrane receptor for intercellular signals controlling cell fate choices in vertebrates and invertebrates. The signal of N activation may be transduced directly from the cell surface into the nucleus by an evolutionarily conserved transcription factor, Suppressor of Hairless [Su(H)], by its regulated nuclear import. Su(H) is shown here to play a direct role in the immediate response of the genome to N signaling in Drosophila. First, Su(H) mutant embryos derived from mutant germ-line clones exhibited a ""neurogenic"" phenotype of neural hypertrophy similar to the N phenotype. Second, the lack of N lateral signaling in these Su(H) mutant embryos was associated with a failure to express the m5 and m8 genes from the Enhancer of split Complex [E(spl)-C]. Finally, the Su(H) protein bound to the regulatory sequences of the E(spl)-C m5 and m8 genes, and these binding sites were required for the activation of the m5 and m8 promoters in the ventral neuroectoderm. The expression of the E(spl)-C m8 gene was found to be similarly regulated by Su(H) during wing imaginal disc development. Thus, the transcriptional activation of these E(spl)-C genes by Su(H) appears to be a direct and relatively general response to the activation of N. However, we also present evidence indicating that N signals in an Su(H)-independent manner during mesectoderm formation.",10.1101/gad.9.21.2598,1995,"M Lecourtois, F Schweisguth"
